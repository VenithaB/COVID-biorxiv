However, we now have actual data for more than 50 consecutive days in India that can be effectively used for projection. Methods: We closely track the trend and use the same pattern for projection. We call this Empirical Model. We also fit a Theoretical Model based on a Gamma function on the pattern of some of the previous epidemics. Results: The Empirical Model predicts the peak around the fourth week of May and the near end of the epidemic by the end of June 2020. The maximum number of active cases is likely to be nearly 75,000 during the second week of June. This would mean a peak demand of nearly 15,000 beds and nearly 4000 ventilators. The case-fatality based on those who have reached an outcome was nearly 10% in the first week of May and is likely to remain at this level for some time. Theoretical Model projected a peak of nearly 2500 new cases per day in the second week of May that seems to have been already breached. This model predicts the near end of the epidemic by the middle of July 2020.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhaya Indrayan","author_inst":"Max Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Shubham Shukla","author_inst":"Max Healthcare"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095794","rel_title":"The Epidemiology of COVID-19 and applying Non Pharmaceutical interventions by using the Susceptible, Infectious Recovered epidemiological Model in Pakistan.","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095794","rel_abs":"Introduction: The COVID-19 is caused by the virus known as sever acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) having the common symptoms such as Flue, fever, dry cough and shortness of breath.

They have been implemented globally during the pandemic, however, the specific NPIs implemented and the timing of interventions has varied widely. We validated two published datasets on the implementation of NPIs globally. The health and socioeconomic factors associated with delay in implementation of NPIs was analyzed using fractional logit and probit models, and beta regression models. The probability of timely NPI implementation by a country was analyzed using a probit model. The effects of these interventions on mobility changes using Google social mobility reports, were analyzed with propensity score matching methods. Three NPIs were analyzed: national school closure, national lockdown, and global travel ban. Countries with higher incomes, larger populations, and better health preparedness measures had greater delays in implementation. Countries with greater population density, more democratic political systems, lower case detection capacity, and later arrival of first cases were more likely to implement NPIs. Implementation of lockdowns significantly reduced physical mobility. Mobility was further reduced when lockdowns were enforced with curfews or fines, or were more strictly defined. National school closures did not significantly change mobility. The implementation of NPIs is a global public good during pandemics, and the international community needs to address constraints and design incentives so countries implement NPIs in a timely manner. Further analysis is needed on the effect of NPI variations on mobility and transmission, and their associated costs.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amit Summan","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy"},{"author_name":"Arindam Nandi","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Qaiser Iqbal","author_inst":"University of Balochistan, Quetta"},{"author_name":"Asad Khan","author_inst":"Quaid i Azam University"},{"author_name":"Nazar Mohammad","author_inst":"World Health Organization, Quetta"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.20096099","rel_title":"Healthcare workers preparedness for COVID-19 pandemic in the occupied Palestinian territory: a cross-sectional survey","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.20096099","rel_abs":"Background: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to overwhelm the capacity of the vulnerable healthcare system in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). Sufficient training of healthcare workers (HCWs) in how to manage COVID-19 and the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) to enable them to do so will be key tools in allowing oPt to mount a credible response to the crisis. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated online questionnaire. Data collection occurred between March 30, 2020 and April 12, 2020. The primary outcomes were the availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness in oPt for COVID-19 pandemic and the secondary outcome was regional and hospital differences in oPt in terms of PPE availability and HCWs preparedness. Results: Of 138 respondents, only 38 HCWs (27.5%) always had access to facemasks when needed and 15 (10.9%) for isolation gowns. The vast majority of HCWs did not find eye protection (n=128, 92.8%), N95 respirators (n=132, 95.7%), and face shields (n=127, 92%) always available. Compared to HCWs in West Bank, those in the Gaza Strip were significantly less likely to have access to alcohol sanitizers (p=0.026) and gloves (p <0.001). On average, governmental hospitals were significantly less likely to have all appropriate PPE measures than non-governmental institutions (p = 0.001). As for preparedness, only 16 (11.6%) surveyed felt confident in dealing with a potential COVID-19 case. With 57 (41.3%) having received any COVID-19 related training and 57 (41.3%) not having a local hospital protocol. Conclusion: HCWs in oPt are underprepared and severely lacking adequate PPE provision. The lack of local protocols and training has left HCWs' confidence exceedingly low. The lack of PPE provision will exacerbate the spread of COVID-19 and deepen the crisis, whilst putting HCWs at risk.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Osaid Alser","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Gaza, occupied Palestinian territory and OxPal Medlink, UK."},{"author_name":"Heba Alghoul","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Islamic University of Gaza, occupied Palestinian territory."},{"author_name":"Zahra Alkhateeb","author_inst":"Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Boston, USA."},{"author_name":"Ayah Hamdan","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Thus, it is extremely recommended to evaluate the health care system to prepare the country to tackle COVID-19 challenges. Methods and Findings: A retrospective and ecological study was performed with data retrieved from the public national healthcare database (DATASUS). Numbers of intensive care unit and infirmary beds, general or intensivists physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, and ventilators from each Regional Health Unity were extracted, and the beds per health professionals and ventilators per population rates were assessed. The accessibility to health services was also performed using a spatial overlay approach to verify regions that lack assistance. It was found that Brazil lacks equity, integrity, and may struggle to assist with high complexity for the COVID-19 patients in many regions of the country.

Due to the lack of drugs and prophylaxis against COVID-19, most of the countries are now relying on maintaining social distance as preventative actions. However, this social distancing can create global socio-economic crisis and psychological disorders. Therefore, these control measures need to have an assessment to evaluate their value in containing the situation. In this study, we analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 in response to different control measures, health care facilities, and prevalent diseases. Based on our findings, the number of COVID-19 deaths found to be reduced with increased medical personnel and hospital beds. We found 0.23, 0.16, and 0.21 as the measurement of significant non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of physicians (p-value [&le;] 7.1*10-6), nurses and midwives (p-value [&le;] 4.6*10-3), and hospital beds (p-value [&le;] 1.9*10-2). Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between the reduction of COVID-19 cases and the earliness of preventive initiation. As a result, enhancing health care facilities as well as imposing the control measures in a short time could be valuable to prevent the currently raging COVID-19 pandemic. The apathy of taking nation-wide immediate precaution measure has identified as one of the critical reasons to make the circumstances worst. Notably, countries including Gambia, Nicaragua, Burundi, Namibia, and Nepal have marked in a state of danger. Interestingly, no association between the comorbidities and severity of COVID-19 was found except for few diseases including cancer, which warranted further investigation at the pathobiological level. We believe that this study could be useful in developing a control strategy in COVID-19 as well as future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Faruq Abdulla","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Faculty of Sciences, Islamic University, Kushtia-7003, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Zulkar Nain","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Islamic University, Kushtia-7003, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Md.

Nevertheless, there is limited information describing the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Latin America. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 9,468 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Ecuador. We calculated overall incidence, mortality, case fatality rates, disability adjusted life years, attack and crude mortality rates, as well as relative risk and relative odds of death, adjusted for age, sex and presence of comorbidities. Results: A total of 9,468 positive COVID-19 cases and 474 deaths were included in the analysis. Men accounted for 55.4% (n = 5, 247) of cases and women for 44.6% (n = 4, 221). We found the presence of comorbidities, being male and older than 65 years were important determinants of mortality. Coastal regions were most affected by COVID-19, with higher mortality rates than the highlands. Fatigue was reported in 53.2% of the patients, followed by headache (43%), dry cough (41.7%), ageusia (37.1%) and anosmia (36.1%). Conclusion: We present the first analysis of the burden of COVID-19 in Ecuador. Our findings show that men are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than women, and risk increases with age and the presence of comorbidities. We also found that blue-collar workers and the unemployed are at greater risk of dying.

We hypothesized that machine learning-based classifiers can reliably distinguish the CXR images of COVID-19 patients from other forms of pneumonia. We used a dimensionality reduction method to generate a set of optimal features of CXR images to build an efficient machine learning classifier that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with high accuracy and sensitivity. By using global features of the whole CXR images, we were able to successfully implement our classifier using a relatively small dataset of CXR images.

Methods We conducted a statewide population-level survey in Vermont from March 29-April 12, 2020, during the beginning of a statewide stay-at-home order. We utilized the USDA six-item validated food security module to measure food insecurity before COVID-19 and since COVID-19. We assessed food insecurity prevalence and reported food access challenges, coping strategies, and perceived helpful interventions among food secure, consistently food insecure (pre-and post COVID-19), and newly food insecure (post COVID-19) respondents. Results Among 3,219 respondents, there was a 33% increase in household food insecurity since COVID-19 (p<0.001), with 35.6% of food insecure households classified as newly food insecure. Respondents experiencing a job loss were more likely to experience food insecurity (OR 3.43; 95% CI, 2.45-4.80). Multiple physical and economic barriers, as well as concerns related to food access during COVID-19, are reported, with respondents experiencing household food insecurity more likely to face access challenges (p<0.001). Significant differences in coping strategies were documented between respondents in newly food insecure vs. consistently insecure households. Conclusions Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in food insecurity in Vermont, accompanied by major food access barriers. These findings have important potential impacts on individual health, including mental health and malnutrition, as well as on future healthcare costs. We suggest proactive strategies to address food insecurity during this crisis.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meredith T.

This paper sheds light on the position of Bangladesh in relation to its South Asian neighbors India and Pakistan with respect to testing capacity and ability to detect cases with increased testing. It also analyzes recent data on case counts and testing numbers in Bangladesh, to provide an idea regarding the number of extra tests needed to detect a substantial number of cases within a short period of time. Findings indicate that compared to India and Pakistan, Bangladesh was able to detect more cases by increasing testing levels and expand its testing capacity by performing more per capita tests. In spite of these achievements, the rate of reported cases per 100 tests was consistently higher for Bangladesh compared to India, which suggests that in addition to increased testing, other factors, such as, effective enforcement of social distancing and efficient contact tracing are just as important in curbing the spread of the disease. The analysis reveals that current testing levels in Bangladesh are not adequate. Based on the findings, we recommend a 30-50\\% growth of the current test rate in the next few days so that by detecting and isolating more cases, Bangladesh could, in effect, contain the spread of new infections. The challenge, however, is to mobilize resources necessary to expand geographical coverage and improve testing quality while enforcing social distancing and performing efficient contact tracing.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasinur Rahaman Khan","author_inst":"Applied Statistics, ISRT, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tamanna Howlader","author_inst":"Applied Statistics, ISRT, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Kevin A.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing morbidities among COVID-19 infected patients and their mortality risks against each type of pre-existing morbidity category. Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using specified relavent keywords. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned pre-print servers (e.g., medRxiv, bioRixv, SSRN), and relevant journal websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs. non-survivor counts or hazard\/odds of deaths or survivors against types of pre-existing morbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Eggers regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. Results: A total of 42 studies included in this study comprised of 39,398 samples. The most common pre-existing morbidities in COVID-19 infected patients were hypertension (36.5%), cardiovascular disease (11.9%), and diabetes (22.0%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (OR: 3.32, 95% CI: 2.79-3.95), immune and metabolic disorders (OR: 2.39, 95% CI: 2.00-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.80-2.26), cerebrovascular diseases (OR: 4.12, 95% CI: 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.63-3.03), renal (OR: 3.02, 95% CI: 2.60-3.52), and liver diseases (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.21-1.71). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of a higher likelihood of deaths among COVID-19 patients against morbidity categories. These findings could potentially help healthcare providers to sort out the most endangered COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mostaured Khan","author_inst":"University of Rajshahi"},{"author_name":"Md Nuruzzaman Khan","author_inst":"Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University"},{"author_name":"Md.

The model has also provided realistic estimates of the total number of infections, active cases and future outcome.

We assessed how the type and timing of public- health interventions impacted the course of the outbreak in Alberta and other Canadian provinces. Methods: We used publicly-available data to summarize rates of laboratory data and mortality in relation to measures implemented to contain the outbreak and testing strategy. We estimated the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 before the state of emergency declaration for each province (R0) and at the study end date (Rt). Results: The first cases were confirmed in Ontario (January 25) and British Columbia (January 28). All provinces implemented the same health-policy measures between March 12 and March 30. Alberta had a higher percentage of the population tested (3.8%) and a lower mortality rate (3\/100,000) than Ontario (2.6%; 11\/100,000) or Quebec (3.1%; 31\/100,000). British Columbia tested fewer people (1.7%) and had similar mortality as Alberta. Data on provincial testing strategies were insufficient to inform further analyses. Mortality rates increased with increasing rates of lab- confirmed cases in Ontario and Quebec, but not in Alberta. R0 was similar across all provinces, but varied widely from 2.6 (95% confidence intervals 1.9-3.4) to 6.4 (4.3-8.5), depending on the assumed time interval between onset of symptoms in a primary and a secondary case (serial interval). The outbreak is currently under control in Alberta, British Columbia and Nova Scotia (Rt <1). Interpretation: COVID-19-related health outcomes varied by province despite rapid implementation of similar health-policy interventions across Canada. Insufficient information about provincial testing strategies and a lack of primary data on serial interval are major limitations of existing data on the Canadian COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed Mahsin","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Seungwon Lee","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"David Vickers","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Alexis Guigue","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Tyler Williamson","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Hude Quan","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Robert Ross Quinn","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Pietro Ravani","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Philip J.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, no study has yet estimated the effect of this pandemic on university students in the UAE or its impact on the psychological well-being of medical students. Methods: In this study, we surveyed 1485 medical (comprising medical and dental) and non-medical university students across 4 emirates within the UAE. We used an online platform to assess knowledge, sources of information, changes in hygienic behavior, perceptions of fear and worry and anxiety levels using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. The GAD-7 score was measured at three time points; during hospital visits for medical\/dental students, before the introduction of online learning and after online learning for all students. Results: The majority of students demonstrated high levels of knowledge and utilized reliable sources of information. Non-medical students exercised higher compliance with social restrictions, while medical students practiced better hand hygiene. Almost half of students reported anxiety levels ranging from mild to severe with females reporting higher anxiety scores during hospital visits (OR=2.02, 95% CI,1.41 to 2.91) and medical students reporting lower anxiety levels in comparison to dental students (OR=0.61, 95% CI,0.45 to 0.84). Medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased with the introduction of online learning, yet, non-medical student's anxiety levels increased with online learning. Conclusions: This is the first study to provide important information on the initial response and anxiety levels in university students across the UAE during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from our study can be used to support the development of effective screening strategies and interventions to build psychological resilience among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergencies in the future.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Basema Saddik","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Amal Hussein","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Fatemeh Saheb Sharif-Askari","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Waad Kheder","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Mohamad-Hani Temsah","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Rim Adnan Koutaich","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Enad Sami Haddad","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Nora Marwan Al-Roub","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Fatema Adel Marhoon","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Hamid","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rabih Halwani","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Joseph L.

Little is known about the impact of unhealthy lifestyles including smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and excessive alcohol intake. We conducted the first large scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors for COVID19. Methods: Prospective cohort study with national registry linkage to hospitalisation for COVID19. Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4, SD 8.8 yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006 to 2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16 March 2020 to 26 April 2020. Results: There were 760 COVID19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID19. We also found a dose dependent increase in risk of COVID19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had four fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52, 7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. This gradient was little affected after adjustment for a wide range of covariates. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID19. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID19 hospital admission, accounting for up to half of severe cases. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Hamer","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mika Kivimaki","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Catharine R Gale","author_inst":"University Southampton"},{"author_name":"George David Batty","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Mohamad-Hani Temsah","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Rim Adnan Koutaich","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Enad Sami Haddad","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Nora Marwan Al-Roub","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Fatema Adel Marhoon","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Hamid","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rabih Halwani","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Joseph L.

We use (a) the stable cumulative infection of various countries and (b) the number of infection versus the tests carried out to evaluate the model. The time-dependent infection rate is set in the model to obtain the best fit with the available data. The model is simulated aiming to project the probable features of the infection in India, various Indian states, and other countries. India imposed an early lockdown to contain the infection that can be treated by its healthcare system. We find that with the current infection rate and containment measures, the total active infection in India would be maximum at the end of June or beginning of July 2020. With proper containment measures in the infected zones and social distancing, the infection is expected to fall considerably from August. If the containment measures are relaxed before the arrival of the peak infection, more people from the susceptible population will fall sick as the infection is expected to see a three-fold rise at the peak. If the relaxation is given a month after the peak infection, a second peak with a moderate infection will follow. However, a gradual relaxation applied well ahead of peak infection, leads to a two-fold increase in the peak infection.

Our model provides a semi-quantitative overview of the progression of COVID-19 in India, with model projections reasonably replicating the current progress.

SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into human host cells, and ACE2 levels in target cells may influence SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. We investigated how pre-existing conditions and drug treatments alter receptor expression in kidney tissue. Using single cell RNA profiling (scRNAseq) to assess ACE2 and associated SARS-CoV-2 proteases in healthy living donors (LD) kidneys, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and in kidney injury during viral infection, ACE2 expression was primarily associated with proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC). ACE2 mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated in DKD versus LD, however, ACE2 levels were not altered by exposures to renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. ACE2+ expression signatures were defined by differential expression analysis and characterized by Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets, resulting in the identification of network modules induced in ACE2 positive PTEC in DKD and BK virus nephropathy. These ACE2 upregulated cell programs were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing and overlapped significantly with the cellular responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar cellular programs were activated in ACE2-positive PTEC isolated in a urine sample from a COVID19 patient with acute kidney injury, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated expression program that may interact with SARS-Cov-2 infection processes. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor associated gene signatures could seed further research into therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Functional networks of gene expression signatures are available for further exploration to researchers at HumanBase (hb.flatironinstitute.org\/covid-kidney).","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajasree Menon","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Edgar A Otto","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Rachel Sealfon","author_inst":"Flatiron Institute"},{"author_name":"Viji Nair","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Aaron K Wong","author_inst":"Simons Foundation Flatiron Institute"},{"author_name":"Chandra L Theesfeld","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Biology"},{"author_name":"Yuan Wang","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Avinash Boppanna","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Jinghui Luo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yingbao Yang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Peter M Kasson","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Jennifer A Schaub","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Celine C Berthier","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Sean Eddy","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Chrysta C Lienczewski","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Bradley Godfrey","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Susan L Dagenais","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ryann Sohaney","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"John Hartman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Damian Fermin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lalita Subramanian","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Helen C Looker","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Harder","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Laura H Mariani","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey B Hodgin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Z Sexton","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christiane E Wobus","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Abhijit S Naik","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robert G Nelson","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"},{"author_name":"Olga G.

Here, we analyze 621 bulk RNA sequencing samples and 7,540 consensus sequences from COVID-19 patients, and identify multiple strains of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, in four major clades that are prevalent within and across hosts. In particular, we find evidence for (i) within-host diversity across phylogenetic clades, (ii) putative cases of recombination, multi-strain and\/or superinfections as well as (iii) distinct strain profiles across geographical locations and time. Our findings and algorithms will facilitate more detailed evolutionary analyses and contact tracing that specifically account for within-host viral diversity in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Palash Sashittal","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Yunan Luo","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Jian Peng","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Mohammed El-Kebir","author_inst":"UIUC"},{"author_name":"Aaron K Wong","author_inst":"Simons Foundation Flatiron Institute"},{"author_name":"Chandra L Theesfeld","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Biology"},{"author_name":"Yuan Wang","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Avinash Boppanna","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Jinghui Luo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yingbao Yang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Peter M Kasson","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Jennifer A Schaub","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Celine C Berthier","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Sean Eddy","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Chrysta C Lienczewski","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Bradley Godfrey","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Susan L Dagenais","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ryann Sohaney","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"John Hartman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Damian Fermin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lalita Subramanian","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Helen C Looker","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Harder","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Laura H Mariani","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey B Hodgin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Z Sexton","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christiane E Wobus","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Abhijit S Naik","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robert G Nelson","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"},{"author_name":"Olga G.

Methods: Directors of 55 EDs in Northern Italy received a questionnaire focusing on the impact of pandemic on activity and organization and on the resources available at re-opening. A section was devoted to gather forecasts and proposals on the return path to normality. Results: All centres had reduced their activities of at least 50% of the pre-COVID-19 period. A rate of endoscopists (13.6%), nurses (25.2%), and health assistants (14%) were not available since infected, or relocated to other departments. One third of endoscopic rooms were converted to COVID-19 care. Two third had the waiting or the recovery areas too small for distancing. A dedicated pathway for infected patients could not be guaranteed in 20% of EDs. Only one third of EDs judged realistic to completely restore a pre-crisis workload by the next months. Optimizing appropriateness of procedures, closer interaction with GPs and triaging patients with telemedicine were the proposals to re-open EDs. Conclusions: The critical issues while re-opening EDs calls for reducing the workload in the endoscopy units through appropriate rescheduling of procedures.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianpiero Manes","author_inst":"ASST Rhodense, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"alessandro Repici","author_inst":"Humanitas"},{"author_name":"Franco Radaelli","author_inst":"Valduce Hospital"},{"author_name":"Simone Saibeni","author_inst":"ASST Rhodense"},{"author_name":"Cristina Bezzio","author_inst":"ASST Rhodense"},{"author_name":"Matteo Colombo","author_inst":"Humanitas"},{"author_name":"Fabio Pace","author_inst":"Seriate Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuan Wang","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Avinash Boppanna","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Jinghui Luo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yingbao Yang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Peter M Kasson","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Jennifer A Schaub","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Celine C Berthier","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Sean Eddy","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Chrysta C Lienczewski","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Bradley Godfrey","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Susan L Dagenais","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ryann Sohaney","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"John Hartman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Damian Fermin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lalita Subramanian","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Helen C Looker","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Harder","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Laura H Mariani","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey B Hodgin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Z Sexton","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christiane E Wobus","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Abhijit S Naik","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robert G Nelson","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"},{"author_name":"Olga G.

Due to the well-known broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the lactoferrin protein, we sought to verify whether its bovine form (bLf) would also be effective in vitro against SARS-CoV-2. Using an antiviral assay based on quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we found that bLf reduced progeny virus yield by up to [~]84,6% in African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero E6) and [~]68,6% in adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) at 1 mg\/mL, a concentration previously shown to have low cytotoxicity.

For RNA isolation we compared four different companies (Qiagen, Invitrogen, BGI and Norgen Biotek). For detection we compared two recently developed Taqman-based modules (BGI and Norgen Biotek), a SYBR green-based approach (NEB Luna Universal One-Step Kit) with published and newly-developed primers, and clinical results (Seegene STARMag RNA extraction system and Allplex 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR assay). Most RNA isolation procedures performed similarly, and while all RT-qPCR modules effectively detected purified viral RNA, the BGI system proved most sensitive, generating comparable results to clinical diagnostic data, and identifying samples ranging from 65 copies - 2.1x105 copies of viral Orf1ab\/l. However, the BGI detection system is [~]4x more expensive than other options tested here. With direct RT-qPCR we found that simply adding RNase inhibitor greatly improved sensitivity, without need for any other treatments (e.g. lysis buffers or boiling). The best direct methods were [~]10 fold less sensitive than indirect methods, but reduce sample handling, as well as assay time and cost.

Following the declaration of the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30th, 2020, it has become imperative to develop diagnostic tools to reliably detect the virus in infected patients. Several methods based on real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA have been developed. In addition, these methods have been recommended by the WHO for laboratory diagnosis. Since all these protocols are based on the use of fluorogenic probes and one-step reagents (cDNA synthesis followed by PCR amplification in the same tube), these techniques can be difficult to perform given the limited supply of reagents in low and middle income countries. In the interest of economy, time and availability of chemicals and consumables, the SYBR Green-based detection was implemented to establish a convenient assay. Therefore, we adapted one of WHO recommended Taqman-based one-step real time PCR protocols (from the University of Hong Kong) to SYBR Green. Our results suggest that SYBR-Green detection represents a reliable cost-effective alternative to increase the testing capacity.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alvaro Fajardo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Marianoel Pereira-Gomez","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Natalia Echeverria","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Fernando Lopez-Tort","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Sede Salto, Centro Universitario Regional Litoral Norte, Universidad de la Republica, Salto, Uruguay."},{"author_name":"Paula Perbolianachis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Fabian Aldunate","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Pilar Moreno","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Moratorio","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Kin Chan","author_inst":"Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jim Woodgett","author_inst":"Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tony Mazzulli","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Sinai Health System\/University Health Network"},{"author_name":"Liliana Attisano","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Laurence Pelletier","author_inst":"Lunenfeld Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Myron I Cybulsky","author_inst":"Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Wrana","author_inst":"Samuel Lunenfeld Research Inst."},{"author_name":"Sotiris Missailidis","author_inst":"Instituto de Tecnologia em Imunobiol\u00f3gicos, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Rafael B.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths to date1,2. In response, we used a rapid antibody discovery platform to isolate hundreds of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We stratify these mAbs into five major classes based on their reactivity to subdomains of S protein as well as their cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV. Many of these mAbs inhibit infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, with most neutralizing mAbs recognizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S. This work defines sites of vulnerability on SARS-CoV-2 S and demonstrates the speed and robustness of new antibody discovery methodologies.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seth J Zost","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Pavlo Gilchuk","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rita Chen","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph X Reidy","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Trivette","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rachel S Nargi","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rachel E Sutton","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Naveen Suryadevara","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elaine C Chen","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elad Binshtein","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Swathi Shrihari","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mario A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jonathan E Didier","author_inst":"Berkeley Lights"},{"author_name":"Keith W MacRenaris","author_inst":"Berkeley Lights"},{"author_name":"Taylor Jones","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel Day","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Luke Myers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.

However, there is limited information on the quality of antibody response generated following vaccination by these vaccine modalities. To better understand antibody response induced by spike protein-based vaccines, we immunized rabbits with various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigens: S-ectodomain (S1+S2) (aa 16-1213), which lacks the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (CT-TM), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-1213 as control). Antibody response was analyzed by ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) against different Spike proteins in native conformation, and a pseudovirion neutralization assay to measure the quality and function of the antibodies elicited by the different Spike antigens. All three antigens (S1+S2 ectodomain, S1 domain, and RBD) generated strong neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 spike Genome Fragment Phage Display Libraries (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL), which identified immunodominant epitopes in the S1, S1-RBD and S2 domains. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that surprisingly the RBD immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with 5-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike antigens compared with other spike antigens. These findings may help guide rational vaccine design and facilitate development and evaluation of effective therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 disease.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySARS-CoV-2 Spike induced immune response","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Supriya Ravichandran","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Coyle","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Laura Klenow","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Juanjie Tang","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Grubbs","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Shufeng Liu","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Tony Wang","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Hana Golding","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Surender Khurana","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Elaine C Chen","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elad Binshtein","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Swathi Shrihari","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mario A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jonathan E Didier","author_inst":"Berkeley Lights"},{"author_name":"Keith W MacRenaris","author_inst":"Berkeley Lights"},{"author_name":"Taylor Jones","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel Day","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Luke Myers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.

The urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. To assist structure-based design of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we have developed CoV3D, a database and resource for coronavirus protein structures, which is updated on a weekly basis. CoV3D provides users with comprehensive sets of structures of coronavirus proteins and their complexes with antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Integrated molecular viewers allow users to visualize structures of the spike glycoprotein, which is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine design efforts, as well as sets of spike-antibody complexes, spike sequence variability, and known polymorphisms. In order to aid structure-based design and analysis of the spike glycoprotein, CoV3D permits visualization and download of spike structures with modeled N-glycosylation at known glycan sites, and contains structure-based classification of spike conformations, generated by unsupervised clustering. CoV3D can serve the research community as a centralized reference and resource for spike and other coronavirus protein structures, and is available at: https:\/\/cov3d.ibbr.umd.edu.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ragul Gowthaman","author_inst":"University of Maryland Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research"},{"author_name":"Johnathan D Guest","author_inst":"University of Maryland Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research"},{"author_name":"Rui Yin","author_inst":"University of Maryland Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research"},{"author_name":"Jared Adolf-Bryfogle","author_inst":"Institute for Protein Innovation"},{"author_name":"William R Schief","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Brian G Pierce","author_inst":"Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research, University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Tony Wang","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Hana Golding","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Surender Khurana","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Elaine C Chen","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elad Binshtein","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Swathi Shrihari","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mario A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jonathan E Didier","author_inst":"Berkeley Lights"},{"author_name":"Keith W MacRenaris","author_inst":"Berkeley Lights"},{"author_name":"Taylor Jones","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel Day","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Luke Myers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.
