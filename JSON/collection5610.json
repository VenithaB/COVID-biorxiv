We report the main features of the development of a novel freely accessible model intended to urgently help researchers and decision makers to predict the evolution of the pandemic in their country. Methods and findings We built a SIR-type compartmental model with additional compartments and features. We made the hypothesis that the number of contagious individuals in the population was negligible as compared to the population size. We introduced a compartment D corresponding to the deceased patients and a compartment L representing the group of individuals who will die but who will not infect anybody (due to social or medical isolation). Our model integrated a time-dependent transmission rate, whose variations can be thought to be related to the public measures taken by each country and a cosine function to incorporate a periodic weekly component linked to the way in which numbers of cases and deaths are counted and reported, which can change from day to day. The model was able to accurately capture the different changes in the dynamics of the pandemic for nine different countries whatever the type of pandemic spread or containment measures. The model provided very accurate forecasts in the relatively short term (10 days). Conclusions In early evaluation of the performance of our model, we found a high level of accuracy between prediction and observed data, regardless of the country. The model should be used by the community to help public health decisions as we will refine it over time and further investigate its performance.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"Inria"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Faron","author_inst":"Gustave Roussy"},{"author_name":"jeremie lefevre","author_inst":"sorbonne universite"},{"author_name":"Jean-David Zeitoun","author_inst":"Centre Epidemiologie Clinique, Hotel Dieu"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104976","rel_title":"A structured model for COVID-19 spread: modelling age and healthcare inequities","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104976","rel_abs":"We use a stochastic branching process model, structured by age and level of healthcare access, to look at the heterogeneous spread of COVID-19 within a population. We examine the effect of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as school closures or social distancing by older people. Although we currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and infection rates between age groups and groups with different levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios illustrate how such evidence could be used to inform specific interventions. We find that an increase in the transmission rates amongst children from reopening schools is unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases, unless this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the degree of inequity and extent of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. Well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that M[a]ori and Pacific peoples are at higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand. This highlights the importance of ensuring that community needs for access to healthcare, including early proactive testing, rapid contact tracing, and the ability to isolate, are being met equitably. Finally, these scenarios illustrate how information concerning contact and infection rates across different demographic groups may be useful in informing specific policy interventions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Rachelle N Binny","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Kate Hannah","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20105528","rel_title":"Reproduction ratio and growth rates: measures for an unfolding pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20105528","rel_abs":"The initial exponential growth rate of an epidemic is an important measure that follows directly from data at hand, commonly used to infer the basic reproduction number. As the growth rates {lambda}(t) of tested positive COVID-19 cases have crossed the threshold in many countries, with negative numbers as surrogate for disease transmission deceleration, lockdowns lifting are linked to the behavior of the momentary reproduction numbers r(t), often called R0. Important to note that this concept alone can be easily misinterpreted as it is bound to many internal assumptions of the underlying model and significantly affected by the assumed recovery period. Here we present our experience, as part of the Basque Country Modeling Task Force (BMTF), in monitoring the development of the COVID-19 epidemic, by considering not only the behaviour of r(t) estimated for the new tested positive cases - significantly affected by the increased testing capacities, but also the momentary growth rates for hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deceased and recovered cases, in assisting the Basque Health Managers and the Basque Government during the lockdown lifting measures. Two different data sets, collected and then refined during the COVID-19 responses, are used as an exercise to estimate the momentary growth rates and reproduction numbers over time in the Basque Country, and the implications of using those concepts to make decisions about easing lockdown and relaxing social distancing measures are discussed. These results are potentially helpful for task forces around the globe which are now struggling to provide real scientific advice for health managers and governments while the lockdown measures are relaxed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maira Aguiar","author_inst":"University of Trento, Italy; Basque Center for Applied Mathematics, Spain; Ikerbasque Foundation, Spain"},{"author_name":"Joseba Bidaurrazaga Van-Dierdonck","author_inst":"Public Health, Basque Health Departmen Rekalde Zumarkalea 39A - 48008, Bilbao, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nico Stollenwerk","author_inst":"Lisbon University, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Kate Hannah","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20105411","rel_title":"Dynamical model for social distancing in the U.S. during the COVID-19 epidemic","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20105411","rel_abs":"Background Social distancing has led to a flattening of the curve in many states across the U.S. This is part of a novel, massive, global social experiment which has served to mitigate the pandemic in the absence of a vaccine or effective anti-viral drugs. Hence it is important to be able to forecast hospitalizations reasonably accurately. Methods We propose on phenomenological grounds a generalized diffusion equation which in- corporates the effect of social distancing to forecast the temporal evolution of the probability of having a given number of hospitalizations. The probability density function is log-normal in the number of hospitalizations, which is useful in describing pandemics where the number of hospital- izations is very high. Findings We used this insight and data to make forecasts for states using Monte Carlo methods. Back testing validates our approach, which yields good results about a week into the future. States are beginning to reopen at the time of publication and our forecasts indicate possible precursors of increased hospitalizations. Additionally we studied the reproducibility Ro in New York (Italian strain) and California (Wuhan strain). We find that even if there is a difference in the transmission of the two strains, social distancing has been able to control the progression of COVID 19.

Methods: UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app provided baseline data including demographics, anthropometrics, smoking status and medical conditions, were asked to log symptoms daily from 24th March 2020 to 23rd April 2020. Participants reporting that they did not feel physically normal were taken through a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and any hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the association between current smoking and the development of classic symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity. In addition, association of subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of ACE2, both the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and a potential mediator of disease severity, with smoking status was assessed in a subset of 541 twins from the TwinsUK cohort. Results: Data were available on 2,401,982 participants, mean(SD) age 43.6(15.1) years, 63.3% female, overall smoking prevalence 11.0%. 834,437 (35%) participants reported being unwell and entered one or more symptoms. Current smokers were more likely to develop symptoms suggesting a diagnosis of COVID-19; classic symptoms adjusted OR[95%CI] 1.14[1.10 to 1.18]; >5 symptoms 1.29[1.26 to 1.31]; >10 symptoms 1.50[1.42 to 1.58]. Smoking was associated with reduced ACE2 expression in adipose tissue (Beta(SE)= -0.395(0.149); p=7.01x10-3). Interpretation: These data are consistent with smokers having an increased risk from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas S Hopkinson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Niccolo Rossi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julia El-Sayed Moustafa","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony A Laverty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Quint","author_inst":"Imperial College, London"},{"author_name":"Maxim B Freydin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Marc Modat","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Kerrin Small","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Richard Davies","author_inst":"Zoe Global Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Ltd"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire J Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College, London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104745","rel_title":"Impact of Superspreaders on dissemination and mitigation of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104745","rel_abs":"Background: The draconian measures used to control COVID-19 dissemination have been highly effective but only at enormous socioeconomic cost. Evidence suggests that superspreaders who transmit the virus to a large number of people, play a substantial role in transmission; recent estimates suggest that about 1-20 percent of people with the virus are the source for about 80 percent of infections. We used an agent-based model to explore the interplay between social structure, mitigation and superspreading. Methods: We developed an agent-based model with a subset of superspreader agents that transmit disease far more efficiently. These agents act in a social network that allows transmission during contacts in three sectors: home, work\/school and other. We simulated the effect of various mitigation strategies that limit contacts in each of these sectors, and used the model to fit COVID-19 mortality data from Sweden. Findings: Reducing contacts in the other sector had a far greater impact on epidemic trajectory than did reducing home or work\/school contacts; this effect was substantially enhanced when the infectivity of children was reduced relative to that of adults. The model fit Swedish hospitalization data with reasonable assumptions about the effect of Sweden's mitigation policies on contacts in the different sectors. Interpretation: Our results suggest COVID-19 could be controlled by limiting large gatherings and other opportunities for contacts between people in restaurants, sporting events, concerts and worship services) while still allowing regular contacts in the home or at work and school.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kim Sneppen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University"},{"author_name":"Robert J Taylor","author_inst":"Independent Consultant, 321 Spring Street, Portland, Maine, USA"},{"author_name":"Lone Simonsen","author_inst":"Roskilde University"},{"author_name":"Anthony A Laverty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Quint","author_inst":"Imperial College, London"},{"author_name":"Maxim B Freydin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Marc Modat","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Kerrin Small","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Richard Davies","author_inst":"Zoe Global Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Ltd"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire J Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College, London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104869","rel_title":"Immunogenic profile of SARS-CoV-2 spike in individuals recovered from COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104869","rel_abs":"The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant mortality and social disruption have highlighted the need to better understand coronavirus immunity to expedite vaccine development efforts. Multiple candidate vaccines, designed to elicit protective neutralising antibodies targeting the viral spike glycoprotein, are rapidly advancing to clinical trial. However, the immunogenic properties of the spike protein in humans are unresolved. To address this, we undertook an in-depth characterisation of humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 spike in humans following mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find serological antibody responses against spike are routinely elicited by infection and correlate with plasma neutralising activity and capacity to block ACE2\/RBD interaction. Expanded populations of spike-specific memory B cells and circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) were detected within convalescent donors, while responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) constitute a minor fraction. Using regression analysis, we find high plasma neutralisation activity was associated with increased spike-specific antibody, but notably also with the relative distribution of spike-specific cTFH subsets. Thus both qualitative and quantitative features of B and T cell immunity to spike constitute informative biomarkers of the protective potential of novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer A Juno","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Hyon-Xhi Tan","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Wen Shi Lee","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Arnold Reynaldi","author_inst":"Kirby Institute, UNSW"},{"author_name":"Hannah G Kelly","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Wragg","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Robyn Esterbauer","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Helen E Kent","author_inst":"Melbourne Sexual Health Centre"},{"author_name":"C Jane Batten","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Francesca L Mordant","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Gherardin","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Phillip Pymm","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Melanie H Dietrich","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Nichollas E Scott","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Wai-Hong Tham","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Dale I Godfrey","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Kanta Subbarao","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza"},{"author_name":"Miles P Davenport","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute, UNSW"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Kent","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Adam K Wheatley","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104919","rel_title":"Modelling to Predict Hospital Bed Requirements for Covid-19 Patients in California","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104919","rel_abs":"A model to predict hospital bed requirements six weeks in advance to treat Covid-19 patients in California is presented.

Serial experiments were carried out to evaluate various factors that might affect aforementioned methodologies, such as types of virus transport mediums, methods of specimen pretreatment and template preparation, specimen vortex strength, specimen storage temperature and duration. The results showed that using {Delta}Cq values as indexes, among various factors that might affect analytical performance, it was better to store specimens in the normal saline transport mediums, inactivate pathogens using water or metal bath, release more virus particles from swabs by vortex mixing, extract nucleic acids with centrifuge methods, and perform amplification assays timely.

To allow every laboratory or hospital access to an inhouse assay, we developed two low cost SARSCoV2 detection assay protocols using inhouse primers and reagents equipment on hand in most biology or diagnostic laboratories a SYBR Green based RTPCR and PCR assays. RNA extraction has also become a major bottleneck due to limited supplies and the required labor. Thus, we validated alternative RNA extraction protocols. Methods SARSCoV2 genome sequences deposited into the GISAID database were retrieved to design and synthesize inhouse primers. Forty patient samples were collected by nasopharyngeal swab, coded, and used to develop and validate the assay protocols. Both assays used TRIzol and heat-processing techniques to extract RNA from patient samples and to inactivate the virus; thus, testing was conducted in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratory. Results The sensitivity and specificity of the primers were evaluated using samples previously confirmed positive for SARSCoV2. The positive amplicons were sequenced to confirm the results. The assay protocols were developed, and the specificity of each PCR product was confirmed using melting curve analyses. The most accurate heat processing technique for primers with short amplicon lengths was 95C for 15 mins. Of 40 samples, both the SYBR Green based quantitative RTPCR assay and the PCR assay detected SARSCoV2 target genes in 28 samples, with no false positive or false-negative results. These findings were concordant with those of the diagnostic laboratory that tested the same samples using a Rotor Gene PCR cycler with an Altona Diagnostics SARSCoV2 kit (R2=0.889). Conclusions These approaches are reliable, repeatable, specific, sensitive, simple, and low cost tools for the detection of SARSCoV2 in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratory, offering alternative approaches when commercial kits are unavailable or cost ineffective.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatimah Alhamlan","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Alqahtani","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Dana Bakheet","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Marie Bohol","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Sahar Althawadi","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Maysoon Mutabagani","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Reem Almaghrabi","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Dalia Obeid","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Kun Wei","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400042, P.R.China."},{"author_name":"Wei-Ping Lu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400042, P.R.China."},{"author_name":"Shao-Li Deng","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400042, P.R.China."},{"author_name":"Qing Huang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400042, P.R.China."},{"author_name":"Bakwatanisa Bosco","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211166, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenhua Gan","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211166, China"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Wang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211166, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Qiao","author_inst":"Medical and Technical Support Department, Pingdingshan Medical District, the 989th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force, Pingdingshan, Henan, 467000, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wu","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210002, China"},{"author_name":"qianghu wang","author_inst":"Nanjing medical university"},{"author_name":"Shukui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210006, China"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"Joint Expert Group for COVID-19, Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei 430100, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104877","rel_title":"COVID-19: the key role of pulmonary capillary leakage.

Since the first observations of COVID-19 patients, significant hypoalbuminemia was detected. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19 patients is due to pulmonary capillary leakage and to test its correlation with indicators of respiratory function. Methods: 174 COVID-19 patients, 92 admitted to the Intermediate Medicine ward (IMW), and 82 to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan were included in this study. Findings: Serum albumin concentration was decreased in the whole cohort, with ICU patients displaying lower values than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g\/L, p<0.0001]. Lower albumin values were found in patients belonging to a more compromised group (lower PaO2 to FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings). In a subset of 26 patients, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) highlighted high protein concentrations, which were correlated to Interleukin-8 and Interleukin-10 BALF concentration. The length of hospitalisation [20 (15-29) vs 8 (5-14) days, p<0.0001] and death rate (52.4% vs 21.7%, p<0.0001) were higher in ICU than in IMW patients, while a strict relation between hypoalbuminemia and 30 day-survival was detected in the whole cohort. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten autopsy lung tissues showed diffuse loosening of interendothelial junctional complex. Interpretation: The degree of hypoalbuminemia can be considered as a useful severity marker in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary capillary leak syndrome secondary to the hyperinflammatory state plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 respiratory dysfunction and should be regarded as a therapeutic target.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maddalena Alessandra Wu","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Fossali","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Laura Pandolfi","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Luca Carsana","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Davide Ottolina","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Frangipane","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Roberto Rech","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Antonella Tosoni","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Andrea Agarossi","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cogliati","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Marchini","author_inst":"University of  Milan"},{"author_name":"Manuela Nebuloni","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Catena","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Colombo","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Qiao","author_inst":"Medical and Technical Support Department, Pingdingshan Medical District, the 989th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force, Pingdingshan, Henan, 467000, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wu","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210002, China"},{"author_name":"qianghu wang","author_inst":"Nanjing medical university"},{"author_name":"Shukui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210006, China"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"Joint Expert Group for COVID-19, Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei 430100, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20105775","rel_title":"Lung ultrasound findings in patients with novel SARS-CoV2","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20105775","rel_abs":"Background: Over 2 million people worldwide have been infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS CoV2). Lung ultrasound has been proposed to diagnose and it. However, little is known about ultrasound findings in these patients. Our aim is to present an overview of lung ultrasound characteristics in critically ill patients with SARS CoV2 pneumonia overall and in relation to the duration of symptoms and clinical parameters. Methods: On the Intensive Care Unit of two academic hospitals, adult patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 were included. Images were analyzed for pleural line characteristics, number and appearance of B-lines, BLUE-profiles (Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency), pathology in the PLAPS (Postero Lateral Alveolar and Pleural Syndrome) point and a LUS-score (lung ultrasound). The primary outcomes were frequencies, percentages and differences in lung ultrasound findings overall and between short ([&le;]14 days) and long (>14 days) duration of symptoms and their correlation with clinical parameters. Results: In this pilot observational study, 61 patients were included with 75 examinations for analysis. The most prevalent ultrasound findings were decreased lung sliding (36%), thickening of the pleural line (42%) and a C-profile per view (37%). Patients with ''long'' duration of symptoms presented more frequently with a thickened and irregular pleural line (21% (32) vs 9% (11), p=.01), C-profile per patient (47% (18) vs. 25% (8),p=.01) and pleural effusion (19% (14) vs 5% (3),p=.02) compared to patients with short duration of symptoms. Lung ultrasound findings did not correlate with P\/F ratio, fluid balance or dynamic compliance, with the exception of the LUS-score and dynamic compliance (R2=0.27, p=.02). Conclusion: SARS CoV2 results in significant ultrasound changes, with decreased lung sliding, thickening of the pleural line and a C-profile being the most observed. With time, a thickened and irregular pleural line, C-profile and pleural effusion become more common findings.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Evert Haaksma","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc"},{"author_name":"Micah L.A.

This has instigated stigma among the general population as the wet market is viewed as a high-risk location for getting infected with coronavirus. Objective This study investigated the prevalence of facemask use among general population visiting the wet market. This study also investigated the demographic factors contributing to unacceptable facemask practice. Setting This prospective observational study was done among visitor to a district wet market selling range of live or freshly slaughtered animals during COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Methods Individuals entering through dedicated entry point were observed for the type, category and practice of wearing personal protective equipment. Inclusion criteria for this study were any individuals entering the wet market. Subjects were categorized into two groups of acceptable and unacceptable facemask practice. The Pearson chi-square was used to test for differences in investigated variables in the univariate setting and Binary Logistic regression model was used in the multivariate setting. Main outcome measure Prevalence, acceptance practice and odds ratio of unacceptance of facemask use. Results Among 1697 individuals included in the final analysis, 1687 (99.7%) was observed wearing facemask with 1338 (78.8%) using medical-grade facemask. Among them, 1615 (95.7%) individuals facemask practice was acceptable while the reaming 72 (4.3%) individuals were observed with unacceptable facemask practice. Individuals using medical-grade facemask and high-risk age group are 6.4 times (OR=6.40; 95% CI, 2.00-20.43; p=.002) and 2.06 times practice (OR=2.06; 95% CI, 1.08-3.94; p=.028). More likely to practice unacceptable facemask use respectively. Conclusion High saturation of facemask among the general population is an adequate indicator of public hygiene measures strategy which can help to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic impact. Alarmingly, the unacceptable facemask practice among high-risk population raises the need for a targeted approach by healthcare authorities to ensure satisfactory facemask use.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gobi Hariyanayagam Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sera Selvanthan Sundram Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Shargunan Selvanthan Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nur Syafina Insyirah Zaimi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nor Amirah Abdul Halim","author_inst":"Ministry of health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Jip Suzanne Nooitgedacht","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc"},{"author_name":"Carlos V.

It has prompted researchers to rapidly mobilize their efforts towards identifying and developing anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Discovering and understanding the virus\u2019 pathways of infection, host-protein interactions, and cytopathic effects will greatly aid in the design of new therapeutics to treat COVID-19. While it is known that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including inhibiting autophagy, there are also dose-limiting toxicities in patients that make clearly establishing their potential mechanisms-of-action problematic. Therefore, we evaluated a range of other autophagy modulators to identify an alternative autophagy-based drug repurposing opportunity. In this work, we found that 6 of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells with EC50 values ranging from 2.0 to 13 \u00b5M and selectivity indices ranging from 1.5 to &gt;10-fold. Immunofluorescence staining for LC3B and LysoTracker dye staining assays in several cell lines indicated their potency and efficacy for inhibiting autophagy correlated with the measurements in the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. Our data suggest that autophagy pathways could be targeted to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and become an important component of drug combination therapies to improve the treatment outcomes for COVID-19.One Sentence Summary Blocking SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effects with selective autophagy inhibitors underlying the clinical benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirill Gorshkov","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences"},{"author_name":"Catherine Z.

Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we suggest that this application can be adapted to other states, small countries, or regions within a country to provide decision makers with critical information necessary to best protect human health.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Kirpich","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Koniukhovskii","author_inst":"EPAM Systems"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Shvartc","author_inst":"EPAM Systems"},{"author_name":"Pavel Skums","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Thomas A.

We are employing pneumatic artificial muscles, such as air cylinders, in the reverse mode of operation to achieve mechanical ventilation. The current design of the device can operate in two modes: controlled mode and assisted mode. Unlike most ICU ventilators, our device does not need a high-pressure air pipeline to operate. With the current design, mechanical ventilation for respiration rate ranging from 10 b\/min to 30 b\/min with a tidal volume range of 150 mL to 1000 mL and I:E ratio of 1:1 to 1:5 can be performed.

As assay details and primer sequences become widely known, many laboratories could perform diagnostic tests using methods such as RT-PCR or isothermal RT-LAMP amplification. A key advantage of RT-LAMP based approaches compared to RT-PCR is that RT-LAMP is known to be robust in detecting targets from unprocessed samples. In addition, RT-LAMP assays are performed at a constant temperature enabling speed, simplicity, and point-of-use testing. Here, we provide the details of an RT-LAMP isothermal assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus with performance comparable to currently approved tests using RT-PCR. We characterize the assay by introducing swabs in virus spiked synthetic nasal fluids, moving the swab to viral transport medium (VTM), and using a volume of that VTM for performing the amplification without an RNA extraction kit. The assay has a Limit-of-Detection (LOD) of 50 RNA copies\/L in the VTM solution within 20 minutes, and LOD of 5000 RNA copies\/L in the nasal solution. Additionally, we show the utility of this assay for real-time point-of-use testing by demonstrating detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in less than 40 minutes using an additively manufactured cartridge and a smartphone-based reader. Finally, we explore the speed and cost advantages by comparing the required resources and workflows with RT-PCR. This work could accelerate the development and availability of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics by proving alternatives to conventional laboratory benchtop tests.\n\nSignificance StatementAn important limitation of the current assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 stem from their reliance on time- and labor-intensive and laboratory-based protocols for viral isolation, lysis, and removal of inhibiting materials. While RT-PCR remains the gold standard for performing clinical diagnostics to amplify the RNA sequences, there is an urgent need for alternative portable platforms that can provide rapid and accurate diagnosis, potentially at the point-of-use. Here, we present the details of an isothermal amplification-based detection of SARS-CoV-2, including the demonstration of a smartphone-based point-of-care device that can be used at the point of sample collection.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anurup Ganguli","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign"},{"author_name":"Ariana Mostafa","author_inst":"University of Illinois at urbana champaign"},{"author_name":"Jacob Berger","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Aydin","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign"},{"author_name":"Fu Sun","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign"},{"author_name":"Enrique Valera","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Brian T.

Currently, there is no vaccine available for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 also uses its receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the spike (S) protein to engage the host receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), facilitating subsequent viral entry. Here we report the immunogenicity and vaccine potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (SARS2-RBD)-based recombinant proteins. Immunization with SARS2-RBD recombinant proteins potently induced a multi-functional antibody response in mice. The resulting antisera could efficiently block the interaction between SARS2-RBD and ACE2, inhibit S-mediated cell-cell fusion, and neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the anti-RBD sera also exhibited cross binding, ACE2-blockade, and neutralization effects towards SARS-CoV. More importantly, we found that the anti-RBD sera did not promote antibody-dependent enhancement of either SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry or authentic virus infection of Fc receptor-bearing cells. These findings provide a solid foundation for developing RBD-based subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV2.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinkai Zang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Chenjian Gu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Bingjie Zhou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Chao Zhang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yong Yang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Shiqi Xu","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Xueyang Zhang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Lulu Bai","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiping Sun","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hong Tang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillette","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhong Huang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.107870","rel_title":"Unfractionated heparin potently inhibits the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to a human cell line","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.107870","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known to bind to the receptor, ACE2, on the surface of target cells. The spike protein is processed by membrane proteases, including TMPRSS2, and either internalises or fuses directly with the cell, leading to infection. We have identified a human cell line that expresses both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the RT4 urinary bladder transitional carcinoma, and used it to develop a proxy assay for viral interactions with host cells. A tagged recombinant form of the spike protein, containing both the S1 and S2 domains, interacted strongly with RT4 cells as determined by flow cytometry, whereas the S1 domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) interacted weakly. S1S2 interaction was temperature dependent and increased sharply at 37{degrees}C, suggesting that processing of the intact spike protein is likely to be important in the interaction. S1S2 protein could associate with cells with a low dependence on ACE2 expression, while RBD required the presence of ACE2 for interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we used a flow cytometric assay to determine the effect of heparin on spike protein interaction with RT4 cells. Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein interaction with an IC50 value of <0.05U\/ml whereas two low molecular weight heparins were much less effective. A mutant form of the spike protein, lacking the Arg-rich region proposed to be a furin cleavage site, interacted very weakly with cells and had a lower affinity for unfractionated and lower molecular weight heparin than the wild type spike protein. This indicates that the furin cleavage site might also be a heparin binding site and potentially important in interactions with host cells. Taken together, our data suggest that heparin, particularly unfractionated forms, could be considered to reduce clinical manifestations of COVID-19 by inhibiting continuing viral infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySince the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, the world has faced a vast public health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 associates with human cells through interaction of the viral spike protein with the host receptor, ACE2. In the absence of a vaccine, new treatments are required to reduce the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a novel technique to demonstrate spike protein interactions with human cells with low levels of ACE2 at the cell surface, suggesting a secondary receptor. We demonstrate the importance of a new heparin-binding site within the viral spike protein for these interactions. We also found that unfractionated heparin was able to bind to the viral spike protein and therefore, potently inhibit viral spike protein interactions with human cells. Our data demonstrate that ACE2 is not absolutely required for spike protein interactions with human cells and furthermore, that unfractionated heparin should be considered as a treatment to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lynda J Partridge","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Lucy Urwin","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Martin JH Nicklin","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"David C James","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Luke R Green","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Peter N Monk","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Xueyang Zhang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Lulu Bai","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiping Sun","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hong Tang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillette","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhong Huang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.108605","rel_title":"Mechanistic insights into ventricular arrhythmogenesis of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.108605","rel_abs":"Background: Recent reports on the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone, or combined with azithromycin (AZM) in the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have raised cardiac safety concerns. Currently, there is limited mechanistic data evaluating cardiac safety with HCQ and AZM therapy. \nMethods: Using comprehensive In Vitro ProArrhythmia Assay (CiPA) Schema IC50 paradigms, we examined the cardiac electrophysiological effects of HCQ and HCQ\/AZM. Molecular modelling explored HCQ and AZM binding properties to hERG. Langendorff-perfused guinea-pig hearts were electrically and optically mapped by multi-electrode array and voltage (RH237) and Ca2+ (Rhod-2 AM) dyes. Human action potential and ion current reconstructions were performed in silico.\nResults: HCQ blocked IKr and IK1 with IC50 concentrations (10+-0.6 and 34+-5.0 microM) within the therapeutic range observed clinically. HCQ also blocked INa and ICaL but at higher IC50, whilst Ito and IKs were unaffected. Contrastingly, AZM produced minor inhibition of INa, ICaL, IKs, and IKr,, with no effect on IK1 and Ito.  HCQ + AZM combined inhibited IKr and IK1 with IC50s of 7.7 +- 0.8 microM and 30.4 +- 3.0 microM, but spared INa, ICaL and Ito,.  Molecular modelling confirmed potential HCQ binding to hERG. Cardiac mapping and ECG studies in isolated hearts demonstrated that HCQ slowed heart rate and ventricular conduction with associated prolongation of PR, QRS and QT intervals. Optical mapping demonstrated, and prolonged, more heterogeneous, action potential durations and intracellular Ca2+ transients. These effects were accentuated with combined HCQ+AZM treatment, which elicited electrical alternans, re-entrant circuits and wave breaks. Reconstruction in a human in-silico model demonstrated that this is attributable to the integrated action of HCQ and AZM reducing IKr, IKs and IK1.\nConclusions: These data provide an electrophysiological basis for recent FDA guidelines cautioning against combined HCQ\/AZM administration for the treatment of Covid-19 on the grounds of potential cardiac safety. We would strongly recommend monitoring of electrocardiographic QT interval with the use of this combination of medications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gongxin Wang","author_inst":"Henan SCOPE  Research Institute of Electrophysiology Co.

All structures are available in CHARMM-GUI COVID-19 Archive (http:\/\/www.charmm-gui.org\/docs\/archive\/covid19), so researchers can use these models to carry out innovative and novel modeling and simulation research for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyeonuk Woo","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Sang-Jun Park","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Yeol Kyo Choi","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Taeyong Park","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Maham Tanveer","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Cao","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Nathan R.

An attractive coronavirus drug target is the main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro) because of its vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors which bind and block the active site of the main protease, but little has been done to address potential non-competitive inhibition which targets regions beyond the active site, partly because the fundamental biophysics of such allosteric control is still poorly understood. In this work, we construct an Elastic Network Model (ENM) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro homodimer protein and analyse the dynamics and thermodynamics of the main proteases ENM. We found a rich and heterogeneous dynamical structure in the correlated motions, including allosterically correlated motions between the homodimeric proteases active sites. Exhaustive 1-point and 2-point mutation scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies confirm previously experimentally identified bioactive residues, but also suggest several new candidate regions that are distant from the active site for control of the protease function. Our results suggest new dynamically-driven control regions as possible candidates for non-competitive inhibiting binding sites in the protease, which may assist the development of current fragmentbased binding screens. The results also provide new insight into the protein physics of fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Igors Dubanevics","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Tom C McLeish","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Yeol Kyo Choi","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Taeyong Park","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Maham Tanveer","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Cao","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Nathan R.

This disease is characterized by important damages at multi-organ level, partially due to the abundant expression of ACE2 in practically all human tissues. However, not every organ in which ACE2 is abundant is affected by SARS CoV-2, which suggests the existence of other multi-organ routes for transmitting the perturbations produced by the virus. We consider here diffusive processes through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 as such alternative route. We found a subdiffusive regime that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a significant rate. By following the main subdiffusive routes across the PPI network we identify proteins mainly expressed in the heart, cerebral cortex, thymus, testis, lymph node, kidney, among others of the organs reported to be affected by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ernesto Estrada","author_inst":"University of Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Tom C McLeish","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Yeol Kyo Choi","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Taeyong Park","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Maham Tanveer","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Cao","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Nathan R.

The current global threat related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread social isolation. Does dreaming change and\/or reflect mental suffering? To address these questions, we applied natural language processing tools to study 239 dream reports from 67 individuals either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during March-April, 2020, when quarantine was imposed in Brazil following the pandemic announcement by the WHO. Pandemic dreams showed a higher proportion of anger and sadness words and higher average semantic similarities to the terms contamination and cleanness. These features were associated with mental suffering related to social isolation, as they explained 39% of the variance in PANSS negative subscale (p=0.0092). These results corroborate the hypothesis that pandemic dreams reflect mental suffering, fear of contagion, and important changes in daily habits.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalia B Mota","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Janaina Weissheimer","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Marina Ribeiro","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Mizziara De Paiva","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Juliana D'Avila","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Simabucuru","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Monica F Chaves","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Lucas Cecchi","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Jaime Cirne","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Cecchi","author_inst":"IBM T.J.

Data about COVID-19 infection in cancer patients are scarce, and they point out a higher risk of complications due to the viral infection in this population. Moreover, cancer treatments could increase viral complications, specially those treatments based on the use of immunotherapy with checkpoints antibodies. There are no clinical data about the safety of immune check point antibodies in cancer patients when they become infected by SARS-CoV-2. As checkpoint inhibitors, mainly anti PD-1 and anti CTLA-4 antibodies, are an effective treatment for most melanoma patients, avoiding their use during the pandemic could lead to a decrease in the chances of curing melanoma. Methods: In Spain we have started a national registry of melanoma patients infected by SARS-Cov-2 since April 1st, 2020. A retrospective analysis of patients included in the Spanish registery has been performed weekly since the activation of the study. Interim analysis shows unexpected findings about cancer treatment safety in SARS-Cov-2 infected melanoma patients, so a rapid communication to the scientific community is mandatory Results: Fifty patients have been included as of May 17th, 2020. Median age is 69 years (range 6 to 94 years), 27 (54%) patients are males and 36 (70%) patients have stage IV melanoma. Twenty-two (44%) patients were on active anticancer treatment with anti PD-1 antibodies, 16 (32%) patients were on treatment with BRAF plus MEK inhibitors and 12 (24%) patients were not on active cancer treatment. COVID-19 episode has been resolved in 43 cases, including 30 (70%) patients cured, four (9%) patients that have died due to melanoma progression, and nine (21%) patients that have died from COVID-19. Mortality rates from COVID-19 according to melanoma treatment type were 16%, 15% and 36% for patients on immunotherapy, targeted drugs, and for those that were not undergoing active cancer treatment, respectively. Conclusion: These preliminary findings show that the risk of death in those patients undergoing treatment with anti PD-1 antibodies does not exceed the global risk of death in this population. These results could be relevant in order to select melanoma therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Gonzalez-Cao","author_inst":"Translational Cancer Research Unit, Instituto Onco"},{"author_name":"Monica Antonazas-Basa","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Teresa Puertolas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain"},{"author_name":"Eva Munoz-Couselo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Vall Hebron, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Luis Manzano","author_inst":"Catalonian Institute of Oncology (ICO-Badalona), Medical Oncology Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute and Hospital (IGTP), Badalona, Barcelona,"},{"author_name":"Cristina Carrera","author_inst":"Melanoma Group IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, (CIBERER) Spain"},{"author_name":"Ivan Marquez-Rodas","author_inst":"Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon and CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Criado","author_inst":"Hospital MD Anderson, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Francisco Rodriguez-Moreno","author_inst":"Centro Integral Oncologico HM Clara Campal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Almudena Garcia-Castano","author_inst":"Hospital Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Martin-Liberal","author_inst":"Catalan Institute Of Oncology (ICO) Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pedro Rodriguez-Jimenez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Susana Puig","author_inst":"Melanoma Group IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona (CIBERER) Spain"},{"author_name":"Pablo Cerezuela","author_inst":"H.U.
