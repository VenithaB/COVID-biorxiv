We selected a biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental model of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection using a 3D human reconstituted airway epithelial model of nasal origin to characterize the effects of nafamostat on tissue-level cellular ultrastructure and viral infection kinetics. Our results confirm the not only the relevance of this model for the preclinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of antiviral candidates, but also the highly potent nature of nafamostat SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity. The studies described herein provided evidence demonstrating the therapeutic potential of nafamostat against COVID-19, as well as its safety upon exposure to lung airway cellular.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUsing a human airway model, study demonstrates the powerful inhibitory effect of nafamostat on SARS-CoV-2 genome copy detection when applied apically.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lynn Kirkpatrick","author_inst":"Ensysce Biosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Millard","author_inst":"Ensysce Biosciences Inc."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"confirmatory results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.299164","rel_title":"Ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin are non-specific promiscuous SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors","rel_date":"2020-09-16","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.299164","rel_abs":"There is an urgent need for vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Encouraging progress has been made in developing antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Among the drug targets being investigated, the viral main protease (Mpro) is one of the most extensively studied drug targets. Mpro is a cysteine protease that hydrolyzes the viral polyprotein at more than 11 sites and it is highly conserved among coronaviruses. In addition, Mpro has a unique substrate preference for glutamine in the P1 position. Taken together, it appears that Mpro inhibitors can achieve both broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a high selectivity index. Structurally diverse compounds have been reported as Mpro inhibitors, with several of which also showed antiviral activity in cell culture. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of six previously reported Mpro inhibitors, ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 using a consortium of techniques including FRET-based enzymatic assay, thermal shift assay, native mass spectrometry, cellular antiviral assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. Collectively, the results showed that the inhibition of Mpro by these six compounds is non-specific and the inhibition is abolished or greatly reduced with the addition of reducing reagent DTT. In the absence of DTT, these six compounds not only inhibit Mpro, but also a panel of viral cysteine proteases including SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, the 2Apro and 3Cpro from enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and EV-D68. However, none of the compounds inhibits the viral replication of EV-A71 or EV-D68, suggesting that the enzymatic inhibition potency IC50 values obtained in the absence of DTT cannot be used to faithfully predict their cellular antiviral activity. Overall, we provide compelling evidence suggesting that ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 are non-specific SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, and urge the scientific community to be stringent with hit validation.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=92 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/299164v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (13K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e68820org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f31c02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b406e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2fa8e8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chunlong Ma","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yanmei Hu","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Julia Alma Townsend","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis Lagarias","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Michael Thomas Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Antonios Kolocouris","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"contradictory results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.16.299800","rel_title":"Lopinavir-ritonavir is not an effective inhibitor of the main protease activity of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro","rel_date":"2020-09-16","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.16.299800","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has caused over 900,000 deaths worldwide as of September 2020, and effective medicines are urgently needed.

Tests for positive selection can identify apparently nonrandom patterns of mutation accumulation within genomes, highlighting regions where molecular function may have changed during the origin of a species. Several recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have identified signals of conservation and positive selection within the gene encoding Spike protein based on the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitution. Such tests cannot, however, detect changes in the function of RNA molecules. Methods: Here we apply a test for branch-specific oversubstitution of mutations within narrow windows of the genome without reference to the genetic code. Results: We recapitulate the finding that the gene encoding Spike protein has been a target of both purifying and positive selection. In addition, we find other likely targets of positive selection within the genome of SARS-CoV-2, specifically within the genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16. Homology-directed modeling indicates no change in either Nsp4 or Nsp16 protein structure relative to the most recent common ancestor. Thermodynamic modeling of RNA stability and structure, however, indicates that RNA secondary structure within both genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome differs from those of RaTG13, the reconstructed common ancestor, and Pan-CoV-GD (Guangdong). These SARS-CoV-2-specific mutations may affect molecular processes mediated by the positive or negative RNA molecules, including transcription, translation, RNA stability, and evasion of the host innate immune system. Our results highlight the importance of considering mutations in viral genomes not only from the perspective of their impact on protein structure, but also how they may impact other molecular processes critical to the viral life cycle.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alejandro Berrio","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Valerie Gartner","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Gregory A.

However, partner proteins that elucidate PKP2 cellular mechanism to understand cardiac dysfunction in ACM are mostly unknown. Here we identify the actin-based motor proteins Myh9 and Myh10 as key PKP2 interactors, and demonstrate that the expression of the ACM-related PKP2 mutant R735X alters actin fiber organization and cell mechanical stiffness. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein acts similarly to this known pathogenic R735X mutant, altering the actomyosin component distribution on cardiac cells. Our data reveal that the viral Nsp1 hijacks PKP2 into the cytoplasm and mimics the effect of delocalized R735X mutant. These results demonstrate that cytoplasmic PKP2, wildtype or mutant, induces the collapse of the actomyosin network, since shRNA-PKP2 knockdown maintains the cell structure, validating a critical role of PKP2 localization in the regulation of actomyosin architecture. The fact that Nsp1 and PKP2 mutant R735X share similar phenotypes also suggests that direct SARS-CoV-2 heart infection could induce a transient ACM-like disease in COVID-19 patients, which may contribute to right ventricle dysfunction, observed in patients with poor survival prognosis.\n\nHighlightsThe specific cardiac isoform Plakophilin-2a (PKP2) interacts with Myh9 and Myh10.\n\nPKP2 delocalization alters actomyosin cytoskeleton component organization.

However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with diabetic nephropathy in comparison to patients with chronic kidney disease. Methods: We used the Mexican Open Registry of COVID-19 patients 11 to analyze anonymized records of those who had symptoms related to COVID-19 to analyze the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, admission, intubation, Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality. Robust Poisson regression was used to relate sex and age to each of the six outcomes and find adjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios. Also, binomial regression models were performed for those outcomes that had significant results to generate probability plots to perform a fine analysis of the results obtained along age as a continuous variable. Results: The adjusted prevalence analysis revealed that that there was a a 87.9% excess probability of developing COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with diabetic nephropathy, a 5% excess probability of being admitted, a 101.7% excess probability of intubation and a 20.8% excess probability of a fatal outcome due to COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison to CKD patients (p<0.01). Conclusions: Patients with diabetic nephropathy had nearly a twofold rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, a higher probability of admission, a twofold probability of intubation and a higher chance of death once admitted compared to patients with chronic kidney disease alone. Also, both diseases had higher COVID-19 pneumonia rates, intubation rates and case-fatality rates compared to the overall population.

Estimating this trajectory from data on numbers of deaths is complicated by the delay between deaths occurring and their being reported to the authorities. In England, Public Health England receives death reports from a number of sources and the reporting delay is typically several days, but can be several weeks. Delayed reporting results in considerable uncertainty about the number of deaths that occurred on the most recent days. In this article, we estimate the number of deaths per day in each of five age strata within seven English regions. We use a Bayesian hierarchical model that involves a submodel for the number of deaths per day and a submodel for the reporting delay distribution. This model accounts for reporting-day effects and longer-term changes over time in the delay distribution. We show how the model can be fitted in a computationally efficient way when the delay distribution is same in multiple strata, e.g. over a wide range of ages.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaun Seaman","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Pantelis Samartsidis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Meaghan Kall","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniela De Angelis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Antara Chatterjee","author_inst":"Breach Candy Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Andr\u00e9s Gonzalez-Guerra","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC)"},{"author_name":"Emilio Camafeita","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares"},{"author_name":"Mariya Lytvyn","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC)"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Isabel Guill\u00e9n","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC)"},{"author_name":"David Sanz-Rosa","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC)"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mart\u00edn-P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC)"},{"author_name":"Cristina Sanchez-Ramos","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC)"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Garcia","author_inst":"Materials Science Factory, Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid (ICMM), CSIC"},{"author_name":"Juan Antonio Bernal","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20191833","rel_title":"Variation across population subgroups of COVID-19 antibody testing performance","rel_date":"2020-09-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20191833","rel_abs":"Understanding variations in the performance of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 across varying demographics is relevant to clinical interpretations and public policy derived from their results.

Regarding Ivermectin safety, several oral studies have shown it to be safe even when used at daily doses much higher than those approved already.

Methods: All active cancer cases presented to the hospital from 8th June to 24 August 2020, and developed symptoms\/ radiological features suspicious of COVID-19 were tested by Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and\/or cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test from a combination of naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical data, treatment details, and outcomes were assessed from the medical records. Results: Of the total 3101 cancer patients admitted to the hospital, 1088 patients were tested and 186 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The CFR in the cohort was 27\/186 (14.5%). Univariate analysis showed that the risk of death was significantly associated with the presence of comorbidities [OR: 2.68; (95%CI: 1.13-6.32); P=0.02], multiple comorbidities [OR: 3.01; (95%CI: 1.02-9.07); P=0.046 for multiple vs. single], and the severity of COVID-19 presentation [OR: 27.48; (95%CI: 5.34-141.49); P=0.0001 for severe vs. not severe]. Among all comorbidities, diabetes [OR: 3.3; (95%CI: 1.35-8.09); P=0.008] and cardiovascular diseases [OR: 3.77; (95%CI: 1.02-13.91); P=0.045] were significant risk factors for death. The receipt of anticancer treatments including chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy within a month before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms had no significant effect on the mortality of cancer patients. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study from India reporting the CFR, clinical associations, and risk factors for mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients. Our study shows that the frequency of COVID-19 in cancer patients is high, and the CFR is 7.6 times more than the national average. Anticancer therapies did not increase the risk of death. Pre-existing comorbidities specially diabetes, multiple comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19 presenting symptoms are significantly linked with COVID-19 related death in the cohort.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anurag Mehta Sr.","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Smreti Vasudevan Sr.","author_inst":"RAJIV GANDHI CANCER INSTITUTE & RESEARCH CENTRE"},{"author_name":"Anuj Parkash Sr.","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Anurag Sharma Jr.","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Tanu Vashist Jr.","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Vidya Krishna Jr.","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Osam Mazda","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daisuke Motooka","author_inst":"Osaka University Research Institute for Microbial Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shota Nakamura","author_inst":"Department of Infection Metagenomics, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Yoshiharu Matsuura","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Satoaki Matoba","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Toru Okamoto","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Junichi Takagi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Protein Synthesis and Expression, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Hoshino","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20192609","rel_title":"Comorbidities and Susceptibility to COVID-19: A Generalized Gene Set Meta-Analysis Approach","rel_date":"2020-09-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20192609","rel_abs":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 820,000 deaths for almost 24 million confirmed cases worldwide, as of August 27th, 2020, per WHO report. Risk factors include pre-existing conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. There are currently no effective treatments. Our objective was to complete a meta-analysis to identify comorbidity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially conferring increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a computational approach. Results SNP datasets were downloaded from publicly available GWAS catalog for 141 of 258 candidate COVID-19 comorbidities. Gene-level SNP analysis was performed to identify significant pathways by using MAGMA program. SNP annotation program was used to analyze MAGMA-identified genes. COVID-19 comorbidities from six disease categories were found to have significant associated pathways, which were validated by Q-Q plots (p<0.05). The top 250 human mRNA gene expressions for SNP-affected pathways, extracted from publicly accessible gene expression profiles, were evaluated for significant pathways. Protein-protein interactions of identified differentially expressed genes, visualized with STRING program, were significant (p<0.05). Gene interaction networks were found to be relevant to SARS and influenza pathogenesis.

There emerged a need for reliable models to estimate the imminent incidence and overall assessment of the outbreak, in order to develop effective interventions and control strategies. One such vital metrics for monitoring the transmission trends over time is the time-dependent effective reproduction number (Rt). Rt is an estimate of secondary cases caused by an infected individual at a time during the outbreak, given that a certain population proportion is already infected. Misestimated Rt is particularly concerning when probing the association between the changes in transmission rate and the changes in the implemented policies. In this paper, we substantiate the implementation of the instantaneous reproduction number (Rins) method over the conventional method to estimate Rt viz case reproduction number (Rcase), by unmasking the real-time estimation ability of both methodologies using credible datasets. Materials & Methods We employed the daily incidence dataset of COVID-19 for India and high incidence states to estimate Rins and Rcase. We compared the real-time projection obtained through these methods by corroborating those states that are containing a high number of COVID19 cases and are conducting high and efficient COVID-19 testing. The Rins and Rcase were estimated using R0 and EpiEstim packages respectively in R software 4.0.0. Results Although, both the Rins and Rcase for the selected states were higher during the lockdown phases (March 25 - June 1, 2020) and subsequently stabilizes co-equally during the unlock phase (June 1- August 23, 2020), Rins demonstrated variations in accordance with the interventions while Rcase remained generalized and under- & overestimated. A larger difference in Rins and Rcase estimates were also observed for states that are conducting high testing. Conclusion Of the two methods, Rins elucidated a better real-time progression of the COVID-19 outbreak conceptually and empirically, than that of Rcase. However, we also suggest considering the assumptions corroborated in the implementations which may result in misleading conclusions in the real world.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amrutha G.S","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)"},{"author_name":"Abhibhav Sharma","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Anudeepti Sharma","author_inst":"Central University of Rajasthan"},{"author_name":"Marta Camacho","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Oriol Sibila","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Joan Ramon Badia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Marta Lopez","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Kilian Vellve","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Ferran Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rosa Faner","author_inst":"CIBERES"},{"author_name":"Isabel Blanco","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Roger Borras","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alvar Agusti","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERES"},{"author_name":"Eduard Gratacos","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERER"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20194159","rel_title":"Containment to outbreak tipping points in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20194159","rel_abs":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been a cornerstone in managing emergent diseases such as COVID-191-4. However, despite their potential to contain or attenuate the epidemic, the effects of NPIs on disease dynamics are not well understood1,5-7. We show that saturation of NPIs with the increase in infected individuals, an expected consequence of limited contact tracing and healthcare capacities, produces a positive feedback in the disease growth rate and a threshold between two alternative states--containment and outbreak8. These alternative states were previously related with the strength of NPIs but not with the infection number2,9-11. Furthermore, the transition between these states involves an abrupt acceleration in disease dynamics, which we report here for several COVID-19 outbreaks around the world. The consequences of a positive feedback in population dynamics at low numbers is a phenomenon widely studied in ecology--the Allee effect. This effect is a determinant of extinction-outbreak states, geographic synchronization, spatial spread, and the effect of exogenous variables, as vaccination12-15. As countries are relaxing containing measures, recognizing an NPI-induced Allee effect may be essential for deploying containment strategies within and among countries16 and acknowledges the need for early warning indicators of approaching epidemic tipping points17.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matias Arim","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Daniel Herrera-Esposito","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Paola Bermolen","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Cabana","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Maria Ines Fariello","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Lima","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica, Chile"},{"author_name":"Hector Romero","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Kilian Vellve","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Ferran Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rosa Faner","author_inst":"CIBERES"},{"author_name":"Isabel Blanco","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Roger Borras","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alvar Agusti","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERES"},{"author_name":"Eduard Gratacos","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERER"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20193896","rel_title":"Are we there yet?

Accordingly, anti-SARS-Cov2 activity has been reported by CK2 inhibitors in vitro, however any anti-CK2 clinical approach has been assessed in Covid-19 patients so far. Here, we investigated the putative clinical benefit of CIGB-325, an anti-CK2 peptide previously used in cancer patients, which was added to the standard-of-care to treat Covid-19. Methods: A monocentric, randomized standard-of-care controlled trial of intravenous CIGB-325 in adults hospitalized with Covid-19. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to receive CIGB-300 (2.5 mg\/kg\/day during 5-consecutive days) plus standard-of-care (10 patients) or standard-of-care (10 patients). Primary outcomes were time to viral clearance defined as the time (in days) to have nasopharyngeal SARS-Cov2 negative PCR and clinical response. This trial is registered with https:\/\/rpcec.sld.cu\/trials\/RPCEC00000317-En (Code: IG\/CIGB300I\/CV\/2001). Results: Most of the patients had initial positive by chest-computed tomography (CT). CIGB-325 treatment reduced both number of pulmonary lesions and lesion's extent compared to control group in seven days. Taking into account the Covid-19 chest-CT abnormalities, CIGB-325 was also superior to control as well as in terms of proportion of patients with such clinical benefit. Improvement of clinical status was experienced in 50% of patients in the CIGB-325 group and 25% in control. Accordingly, systemic levels of CPK, LDH and CRP were lowered at day 7 by treating with this anti-CK2 peptide. Both therapeutic regimens were similar respect to SARS-Cov2 clearance in nasopharynx swabs over the time. Conclusion: Our study revealed that consecutive-5 day regimen of intravenous CIGB-325 at 2.5 mg\/kg quickly improved the chest-CT outcomes over standard-of-care. This is the first report describing signs of clinical benefit of an anti-CK2 approach in Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leticia R.

Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. Methods: We analyzed the public statements and speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States, Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19 and pandemic response. We used a deductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language used and content discussed. Findings: Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19 made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women leaders spoke more frequently about the impact on local or individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including addressing to: mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their citizen population. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe the COVID-19 virus and response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. Conclusion: While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This language is important because it influences how leaders inspire citizens to adhere to the social contract, and the priorities they highlight and the words they use are meant to resonate with the rest of the nation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara Dada","author_inst":"Vayu Global Health Foundation"},{"author_name":"Henry C Ashworth","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Marlene Joannie Bewa","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Roopa Dhatt","author_inst":"Women in Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carmen Valenzuela","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Immunology"},{"author_name":"Raul Santana","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria M.

In this study, we flushed and collected samples from showers in buildings that had been unoccupied for approximately two months and quantified Legionella pneumophila using a commercial cultivation-based assay. In addition, all bacteria, Legionella spp., L. pneumophila, L. pneumophila serogroup 1, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) were analyzed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Despite low or negligible total chlorine in the stagnant pre-flush water samples, L. pneumophila were not detected by either method; Legionella spp., NTM, and MAC, however, were widespread. Using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), estimated risks of clinical illness from exposure to legionella and MAC via showering were generally low, but the risk of subclinical infection via Legionella spp. could exceed a 10-7 daily risk threshold if just a small fraction ([&ge;]0.1 %) of those legionellae detected by qPCR are highly infectious. Flushing cold and hot water lines rapidly restored a total chlorine (as chloramine) residual and decreased all bacterial gene targets to building inlet water levels within 30 min. Following flushing, the chlorine residual rapidly dissipated and bacterial gene targets rebounded, approaching pre-flush concentrations after 6 to 7 days of stagnation. These results suggest that stagnant water in premise plumbing may contain elevated levels of opportunistic pathogens; flushing, however, can rapidly improve water quality and reduce the health risk but the improvement will be short-lived if building disuse persists.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raymond M Hozalski","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Timothy M LaPara","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Xiaotian Zhao","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Taegyu Kim","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael B Waak","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology & SINTEF Community"},{"author_name":"Tucker Burch","author_inst":"U.S. Department of Agriculture"},{"author_name":"Michael McCarty","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ariadna Garcia","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deyli Chacon","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Delvin Thompson","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Perera","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ariel Gonzalez","author_inst":"International Center of Health La Pradera"},{"author_name":"Rafael Reyes","author_inst":"National Institute of Oncology and Radiobiology"},{"author_name":"Loida Torres","author_inst":"International Center of Health La Pradera"},{"author_name":"Jesus Perez","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yania Valido","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ralysmay Rodriguez","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dania M.

The aim was to investigate the frequency and impact of SARS-CoV-2 in parturient women, their partners and newborns. Methods: From April 4th to July 3rd, 2020, all parturient women, their partners and newborns were invited to participate in the study. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission and immediately after delivery a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history, obstetric- and neonatal information were available. Results: A total of 1,361 parturient women, 1,236 partners and 1,342 newborns participated in the study. No associations between previous COVID-19 disease and obstetric- or neonatal complications were found. The adjusted serological prevalence was 2.9% in women and 3.8% in partners. The frequency of blood type A was significantly higher in women with antibodies compared to women without antibodies. 17 newborns had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, and none had IgM antibodies. Full serological data from 1,052 families showed an absolute risk of infection of 0.37 if the partner had antibodies. Only 55% of individuals with antibodies reported symptoms. Conclusion: This large prospective cohort study reports no association between COVID-19 and obstetric- or neonatal complications. The family pattern showed a substantial increase in absolute risk for women living with a partner with antibodies.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pia Egerup","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Line Fich Olsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ann-Marie Hellerung Christiansen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Westergaard","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital and Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University "},{"author_name":"Elin Rosenbek Severinsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathrine Vauvert Roemmelmayer Hviid","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Astrid Marie Kolte","author_inst":"The Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Unit, The Capital Region, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and"},{"author_name":"Amalie Dyhrberg Boje","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marie-Louise Mathilde Friis Bertelsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lisbeth Praetorius","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne Zedeler","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Josefine Reinhardt Nielsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Didi Bang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sine Berntsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jeppe Ethelberg-Findsen","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Ditte Marie Storm","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Judith Bello-Rodriguez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Andreas Ingham","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Olle-Lopez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Eva Hoffmann","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Wilken-Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lone Krebs","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical S"},{"author_name":"Finn Stener Joergensen","author_inst":"Fetal Med.

In this study, we investigated whether NLR levels on admission could predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. A literature search was conducted on 23 July 2020 to retrieve all published articles, including grey literature and preprints, investigating the association between on-admission NLR values and severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). A meta-analysis was performed to determine the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) in NLR values and the pooled risk ratio (RR) for severity and mortality with the 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI). Meta-regression analysis was done to identify potential confounders. A total of 38 articles, including 5699 patients with severity outcomes and 6033 patients with mortality outcomes, were included. The meta-analysis showed that severe and non-survivors of COVID-19 had higher on-admission NLR levels than non-severe and survivors (SMD 0.88; 95%CI 0.72-1.04; I2=75% and 1.68; 95%CI 0.98-2.39; I2=99%, respectively). Regardless of the different NLR cut-off values, the pooled mortality RR in patients with elevated vs. normal NLR levels was 2.75 (95%CI 0.97-7.72). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between NLR levels on admission and COVID-19 severity and mortality was unaffected by age (p=0.236; p=0.213, respectively). High NLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Further studies need to focus on determining the optimal cut-off value for NLR before clinical use.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Martin Simadibrata","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Julius Calvin","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Alya Darin Wijaya","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Naufal Arkan Abiyyu Ibrahim","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Elin Rosenbek Severinsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathrine Vauvert Roemmelmayer Hviid","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Astrid Marie Kolte","author_inst":"The Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Unit, The Capital Region, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and"},{"author_name":"Amalie Dyhrberg Boje","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marie-Louise Mathilde Friis Bertelsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lisbeth Praetorius","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne Zedeler","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Josefine Reinhardt Nielsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Didi Bang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sine Berntsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jeppe Ethelberg-Findsen","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Ditte Marie Storm","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Judith Bello-Rodriguez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Andreas Ingham","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Olle-Lopez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Eva Hoffmann","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Wilken-Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lone Krebs","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical S"},{"author_name":"Finn Stener Joergensen","author_inst":"Fetal Med.

Most countries have implemented some social restrictions to control it. In this work we will use mathematical modelling to assess the current social restrictions in controlling the spread of the disease. We formulate a simple susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model to describe the spread of the coronavirus under social restrictions. The transmission rate in this model is considered variable to catch social restrictions impact. We analyze this model, then fit the model to 160 days induced death data in Italy, Iran, USA, Germany, France, India, Spain and China. we estimate some factors that help in understanding not only the spread of the disease but also assess the current social restriction in controlling this disease. Results: We find a formula for the basic reproduction function (R(t)) and the maximum number of daily infected people. Then estimate the model's parameters with 95% confidence intervals in these countries. We notice that the model has excellent fit to the disease death data in all considered countries except Iran. The percentage of disease death estimated by the model in Germany and France are 3.8% and 1.2% respectively, which are close to reported percentages values. Finally, we estimate the time, after first reported death, spent under social restrictions to reduce the basic reproduction function (R(t)) to one unit. The times to do that in Italy, USA, Germany, France, Spain and China are 40, 50, 34,58, 31, and 15 days respectively. However, the Indian social restrictions in the 160 days were not enough to reach $R(t)=1$. The transmission rate is between 0.1035- 1.6076 and recovery rate is between 0-0.2456. The disease death rates calculated for Germany and France are more realistic than others with average value 0.0023. Extending the same social restrictions for enough time could control the disease in Italy, USA, Germany, France, India, Spain and China. While, more social restrictions are needed to control the disease in India.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mo'tassem Al-arydah","author_inst":"Department of mathematics, Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Khalid Dib","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Hailay Weldegiorgis Berhe","author_inst":"Department of mathematics, Mekelle University"},{"author_name":"Kalyanasundaram Madhu","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Elin Rosenbek Severinsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathrine Vauvert Roemmelmayer Hviid","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Astrid Marie Kolte","author_inst":"The Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Unit, The Capital Region, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and"},{"author_name":"Amalie Dyhrberg Boje","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marie-Louise Mathilde Friis Bertelsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lisbeth Praetorius","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne Zedeler","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Josefine Reinhardt Nielsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Didi Bang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sine Berntsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jeppe Ethelberg-Findsen","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Ditte Marie Storm","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Judith Bello-Rodriguez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Andreas Ingham","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Olle-Lopez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Eva Hoffmann","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Wilken-Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lone Krebs","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical S"},{"author_name":"Finn Stener Joergensen","author_inst":"Fetal Med.

Robust humoral anti-viral immune responses have the potential to generate a diverse set of neutralizing antibodies to eliminate viruses and protect against re-infection, transmission, and the evolution of mutations that escape targeted therapeutics. CD73 is present on the majority of human B cells and a subset of T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into adenosine, which can be immunosuppressive. Here we report on CPI-006, a humanized Fc{gamma}R binding-deficient IgG1 anti-CD73 antibody that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and directly activates CD73+ B cells, inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of adenosine. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood from advanced cancer patients receiving CPI-006 revealed evidence of B cell activation, clonal expansion, and development of memory B cells. These immune effects suggested that CPI-006 may be effective at enhancing the magnitude, diversity, and duration of humoral and cellular responses to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We have therefore initiated a Phase 1, single-dose, dose-escalation trial in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety of CPI-006 in COVID-19 patients and to determine effects of CPI-006 on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and the development of memory B cell and T cells. Ten patients have been enrolled in the trial receiving doses of 0.3 mg\/kg or 1.0 mg\/kg. All evaluable patients had low pre-treatment serum levels of anti-viral antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and its receptor binding domain, independent of the duration of their COVID-19 related symptoms prior to enrollment. Anti-viral antibody responses were induced 7 days after CPI-006 treatment and titers continued to rise past Day 56. Increases in the frequency of memory B cells and effector\/memory T cells were observed 28 days after treatment. These preliminary results suggest that CPI-006 activates B cells and may enhance and prolong anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19. This approach may be useful for treating COVID-19 or as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of vaccines.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen B Willingham","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Medicine and Surgery at Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA"},{"author_name":"Craig Hill","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Shenshen Hu","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Jenny A Rudnick","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Barbara Daine-Matsuoka","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica Hsieh","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Haider Mashhedi","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Andrew N Hotson","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Brody","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10003, USA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Marron","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10003, USA"},{"author_name":"Emily Piccione","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Buggy","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Suresh Mahabhashyam","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"William B Jones","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Mehrdad Mobasher","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Richard A Miller","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Andreas Ingham","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Olle-Lopez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Eva Hoffmann","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Wilken-Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lone Krebs","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical S"},{"author_name":"Finn Stener Joergensen","author_inst":"Fetal Med.

The main pre-admission comorbidities were arterial 94 hypertension (6,030, 50%), hyperlipidemia (4,741, 39.4%) and diabetes mellitus (2,309, 19.2%). The 95 average number of days from COVID-19 symptom onset to hospital admission was 6.7 days (SD 7). 96 The triad of fever, cough, and dyspnea was present almost uniformly in all 4 clinical phenotypes 97 identified by clustering. Cluster C1 (8,737 patients, 72.4%) was the largest, and comprised patients 98 with the triad alone. Cluster C2 (1,196 patients, 9.9%) also presented with ageusia and anosmia; 99 cluster C3 (880 patients, 7.3%) also had arthromyalgia, headache, and sore throat; and cluster C4 100 (1,253 patients, 10.4%) also manifested with diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Compared to 101 each other, cluster C1 presented the highest in-hospital mortality (24.1% vs. 4.3% vs. 14.7% vs. 102 18.6%; p<0.001). The multivariate study identified phenotypic clusters as an independent factor for 103 in-hospital death. (4) Conclusion: The present study identified 4 phenotypic clusters in patients with 104 COVID-19 pneumonia, which predicted the in-hospital prognosis of clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuel Rubio-Rivas","author_inst":"Bellvitge University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xavier Corbella","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Bellvitge University Hospital, Bellvitge.

We quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater influent and primary settled solids in two wastewater treatment plants to inform the pre-analytical and analytical approaches, and to assess whether influent or solids harbored more viral targets. The primary settled solids samples resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 detection frequencies than the corresponding influent samples. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more readily detected in solids using one-step digital droplet (dd)RT-PCR than with two-step RT-QPCR and two-step ddRT-PCR, likely owing to reduced inhibition with the one-step ddRT-PCR assay. We subsequently analyzed a longitudinal time series of 89 settled solids samples from a single plant for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as coronavirus recovery (bovine coronavirus) and fecal strength (pepper mild mottle virus, PMMoV) controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets N1 and N2 concentrations correlate positively and significantly with COVID-19 clinical confirmed case counts in the sewershed.

Molecular assays on nasopharyngeal swabs remain the cornerstone of COVID-19 diagnostic. Despite massive worldwide efforts, the high technicalities of nasopharyngeal sampling and molecular assays, as well as scarce resources of reagents, limit our testing capabilities. Several strategies failed, to date, to fully alleviate this testing process (e.g. saliva sampling or antigen testing on nasopharyngeal samples). We assessed the performances of a new ELISA microplate assay quantifying SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-antigen) in serum or plasma. Methods. The specificity of the assay, determined on 63 non-COVID patients, was 98.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.3 to 100). Performances were determined on 227 serum samples from 165 patients with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection included in the French COVID and CoV-CONTACT cohorts. Findings. Sensitivity was 132\/142, 93.0% (95% CI, 84.7 to 100), within the first two weeks after symptoms onset. A subset of 73 COVID-19 patients had a serum collected within 24 hours following or preceding a positive nasopharyngeal swab. Among patients with high nasopharyngeal viral loads, Ct value below 30 and 33, only 1\/50 and 4\/67 tested negative for N-antigenemia, respectively. Among patients with a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, 8\/12 presented positive N-antigenemia. The lower respiratory tract was explored for 6\/8 patients, showing positive PCR in 5 cases. Interpretation. This is the first demonstration of the N-antigen antigenemia during COVID-19. Its detection presented a robust sensitivity, especially within the first 14 days after symptoms onset and high nasopharyngeal viral loads. These findings have to be confirmed with higher representation of outpatients. This approach could provide a valuable new option for COVID-19 diagnosis, only requiring a blood draw and easily scalable in all clinical laboratories.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quentin Le Hingrat","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Cedric Laouenan","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Center for Clinical Investigation, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tubiana","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Center for Clinical Investigation, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Lila Bouadma","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Pari"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Tropical and infectious diseases Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, Franc"},{"author_name":"Xavier Duval","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Center for Clinical Investigation, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Houria Ichou","author_inst":"Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Florence Damond","author_inst":"Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Melanie Bertine","author_inst":"Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nabil Benmalek","author_inst":"Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"- French COVID cohort management committee","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"- CoV-CONTACT study group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Christophe Choquet","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Pari"},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Tropical and infectious diseases Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, Franc"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Charpentier","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nadhira Houhou-Fidouh","author_inst":"Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jose Nicolas Alcala Pedrajas","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Pozoblanco Hospital, Pozoblanco (Cordoba), Spain"},{"author_name":"Anabel Martin Urda Diez Canseco","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Palamos Hospital, Palamos (Girona), Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Esteban Giner","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Virgen de los Lirios Hospital, Alcoy (Alicante), Spain"},{"author_name":"Pablo Telleria Gomez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Valladolid Clinical University Hospital, Valladolid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Gomez Huelgas","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Regional University Hospital of Malaga.

We hypothesized that clinical, biological and radiological characteristics of patients with false negative first RT-PCR testing, despite final diagnosis of COVID19, might differ from patients with positive first RT PCR. Methods: Case \/ control, multicenter study in which COVID19 patients with negative first RT PCR testing were matched to patients with positive first RT PCR on age, gender and initial admission unit (ward or intensive care). Results: Between March 30, and June 22, 2020, 80 cases and 80 controls were included. Neither proportion of death at hospital discharge, nor duration of hospital length stay differed between case and control patients (P=0.80 and P=0.54, respectively). In multivariate analysis, headache (adjusted OR: 0.07 [0.01 ; 0.49]; P=0.007) and fatigue\/malaise (aOR: 0.16 [0.03 ; 0.81]; P=0.027) were associated with lower risk of false negative, whereas platelets > 207.103.mm-3 (aOR: 3.81 [1.10 ; 13.16]; P=0.034) and CRP > 79.8 mg.L-1 (aOR: 4.00 [1.21 ; 13.19]; P=0.023) were associated with higher risk of false negative. Interpretation: Patients with suspected COVID19 and higher inflammatory biological signs expected higher risk of false negative RT PCR testing.

Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 mainly depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells. Therefore, repurposing of known drugs to inhibit S protein-ACE2 interaction could be a quick way to develop effective therapy for COVID-19. Using a high-throughput screening system to investigate the interaction between spike receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and ACE2 extracellular domain, we screened 3581 FDA-approved drugs and natural small molecules and identified ceftazidime as a potent compound to inhibit S-RBD-ACE2 interaction by binding to S-RBD. In addition to significantly inhibit S-RBD binding to HPAEpiC cells, ceftazidime efficiently prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to infect ACE2-expressing 293T cells. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 113.2 M, which is far below the blood concentration (over 300 M) of ceftazidime in patients when clinically treated with recommended dose. Notably, ceftazidime is a drug clinically used for the treatment of pneumonia with minimal side effects compared with other antiviral drugs. Thus, ceftazidime has both anti-bacterial and anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, which should be the first-line antibiotics used for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ChangDong Lin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for

causative agent of COVID-19, is responsible for over 24 million infections and 800,000 deaths since its emergence in December 2019. There are few therapeutic options and no approved vaccines. Here we examine the properties of highly potent human monoclonal antibodies (hu-mAbs) in a mouse adapted model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2 MA). In vitro antibody neutralization potency did not uniformly correlate with in vivo activity, and some hu-mAbs were more potent in combination in vivo. Analysis of antibody Fc regions revealed that binding to activating Fc receptors is essential for optimal protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA. The data indicate that hu-mAb protective activity is dependent on intact effector function and that in vivo testing is required to establish optimal hu-mAb combinations for COVID-19 prevention.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra Schaefer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Frauke Muecksch","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Julio C.C.
