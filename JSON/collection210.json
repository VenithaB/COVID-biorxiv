Optimization of existing rapid tests in whole blood will require significant effort in the short-term and there is a need for solutions to help bridge the gap in performance between plasma and whole blood. We demonstrate here the implementation of the H.E.R.M.E.S platform, a portable plasma separation system that can enhance the performance of blood-based diagnostic testing, with a commercially available SARS-COV-2 IgG\/IgM serology rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in a blinded study with 61 human samples. We compare the performance of the RDT in whole blood and separated plasma and highlight that plasma yields a 39% increase in positivity agreement with PCR in samples collected from patients with early infections. We further legitimize the increase in positivity agreement rate with the help of an independent evaluation by 10 previously untrained users. The H.E.R.M.E.S plasma separation system circumvents the need for assay optimization in whole blood and furthers the legitimacy of incorporating SARS-COV-2 serology RDTs at the point-of-care. The data highlighted in this work makes a compelling case for the incorporation of the H.E.R.M.E.S system in large scale efforts to perform SARS-COV-2 serology testing in decentralized testing environments.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sasank Vemulapati","author_inst":"Hermes Life Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.01.20203711","rel_title":"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on psychosocial factors, health, and lifestyle in Scottish octogenarians: the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 Study","rel_date":"2020-10-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.01.20203711","rel_abs":"Background: Little is known about effects of COVID-19 lockdown on psychosocial factors, health and lifestyle in older adults, particularly those aged over 80 years, despite the risks posed by COVID-19 to this age group. Methods: Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 members, mean age 84 years (SD=0.3), responded to an online questionnaire in May 2020 (n=190). We examined responses (experience and knowledge of COVID-19; adherence to guidance; impact on day-to-day living; social contact; self-reported physical and mental health; loneliness; and lifestyle) and relationships between previously-measured characteristics and questionnaire outcomes. Results: Four respondents experienced COVID-19; most had good COVID-19 knowledge (94.7%) and found guidance easy to understand (86.3%). There were modest declines in self-reported physical and mental health, and 48.2% did less physical activity. In multivariable regression models, adherence to guidance by leaving the house less often associated with less professional occupational class (OR=0.71, 95%CI 0.51-0.98) and poorer self-rated general health (OR=0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92). Increased internet use associated with female sex (OR=2.32, 95%CI 1.12-4.86) and higher general cognitive ability (OR=1.53, 95%CI 1.03-2.33). Loneliness associated with living alone (OR=0.15, 95%CI 0.07-0.31) and greater anxiety symptoms (OR=1.76, 95%CI 0.45-1.24). COVID-19 related stress associated with lower emotional stability scores (OR=0.40, 95%CI 0.24-0.62). Decreased physical activity associated with less professional occupational class (OR=1.43, 95%CI 1.04-1.96), and lower general cognitive ability (OR=0.679, 95%CI 0.491-0.931). Conclusions: Characteristics including cognitive function, occupational class, self-rated health, anxiety, and emotional stability, may be related to risk of poorer lockdown-related psychosocial and physical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adele M Taylor","author_inst":"The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Danielle Page","author_inst":"The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Judith A Okely","author_inst":"The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Janie Corley","author_inst":"The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Miles Welstead","author_inst":"The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Barbora Skarabela","author_inst":"The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Paul Redmond","author_inst":"The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Tom C Russ","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Simon R Cox","author_inst":"The University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.01.20205146","rel_title":"An Integrated Framework with Machine Learning and Radiomics for Accurate and Rapid Early Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray","rel_date":"2020-10-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.01.20205146","rel_abs":"Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is considered the first key action to prevent spread of the virus. Currently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as a gold standard point-of-care diagnostic tool. However, several limitations of RT-PCR have been identified, e.g., low sensitivity, cost, long delay in getting results and the need of a professional technician to collect samples. On the other hand, chest X-ray (CXR) is routinely used as a cost-effective diagnostic test for diagnosis and monitoring different respiratory abnormalities and is currently being used as a discriminating tool for COVID-19. However, visual assessment of CXR is not able to distinguish COVID-19 from other lung conditions. Several machine learning algorithms have been proposed to detect COVID-19 directly from CXR images with reasonably good accuracy on a data set that was randomly split into two subsets for training and test. Since these methods require a huge number of images for training, data augmentation with geometric transformation was applied to increase the number of images. It is highly likely that the images of the same patients are present in both the training and test sets resulting in higher accuracies in detection of COVID-19. It is, therefore, vital to assess the performance of COVID-19 detection algorithm on an independent data set with different degrees of the disease before being employed for clinical settings. On the other hand, machine learning techniques that depend on handcrafted features extraction and selection approaches can be trained with smaller data set. The features can also be analyzed separately for various lung conditions. Radiomics features are such kind of handcrafted features that represent heterogeneous appearance of the lung on CXR quantitatively and can be used to distinguish COVID-19 from other lung conditions. Based on this hypothesis, a machine learning based technique is proposed here that is trained on a set of suitable radiomics features (71 features) to detect COVID-19. It is found that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Ensemble Bagging Model Trees (EBM) trained on these 71 radiomics features can distinguish between COVID-19 and other diseases with an overall sensitivity of 99.6% and 87.8% and specificity of 85% and 97% respectively. Though the performance is comparable for both methods, EBM is more robust across severity levels. Severity, in this case, was scored between 0 to 4 by two experienced radiologists for each lung segment of each CXR image represents the degree of severity of the disease. For the case of 0 severity, sensitivity and specificity of the EBM method are 91.7% and 100% respectively indicating that there are certain radiomics pattern that are not visibly distinguishable. Since the proposed method does not require any manual intervention (e.g., sample collection etc.), it can be integrated with any standard X-ray reporting system to be used as an efficient, cost-effective and rapid early diagnosis device. It can also be deployed in places where quick results of the COVID-19 test are required, e.g., airports, seaports, hospitals, health clinics, etc.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahbubunnabi Tamal","author_inst":"Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Maha Alshammari","author_inst":"Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Meernah Alabdullah","author_inst":"Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Rana Hourani","author_inst":"Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Hossain Abu Alola","author_inst":"Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Tarek M.

In our observational cohort study of the exhaled breath particles of 74 healthy human subjects, and in our experimental infection study of eight nonhuman primates infected by aerosol with SARS-CoV-2, we found that exhaled aerosol particles increase one to three orders of magnitude with aging, high BMI, and COVID-19 infection. These variances appear to be related to changes in airway mucus surface composition and the propensity for mucus surfaces to breakup into small droplets during acts of breathing. We also observed that 20% of those participating in our human study accounted for 80% of the overall exhaled bioaerosol, reflecting a bioaerosol distribution analogous to a classical 20:80 super spreader distribution.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David A Edwards","author_inst":"Sensory Cloud"},{"author_name":"Dennis Ausiello","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Robert Langer","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Salzman","author_inst":"Sensory Cloud"},{"author_name":"Tom Devlin","author_inst":"Sensory Cloud"},{"author_name":"Brandon J.

Many HCW including the medical interns, are directly or indirectly involved in the management. Methods This is a cross-sectional, pilot study to determine the impact of the pandemic on UMMC medical interns. A survey which comprises 37-items was used. Data are analysed by Ordinal Logistic Regression Analysis. Results Our study shows that medical interns are tired (p = 0.014), starving (p = 0.004), have inadequate exercises (p = 0.004) and burdened with heavy workload (p=0.023) during pandemic period. Many are depressed (p = 0.043), scared to work (p = 0.03), and worried of getting infected (p < 0.05). Some quarrel with their colleagues (p < 0.05), losing contact with friends (p = 0.022) and feel that it will be beneficial to have a peer support group (p = 0.027). Conclusion In summary, the impact of COVID-19 amongst medical interns is significant and their overall well-being should be protected without jeopardising their training.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"WeiHonn Lim","author_inst":"University Malaya Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Li Ying Teoh","author_inst":"University Malaya Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Kanesh Kumaran Seevalingam","author_inst":"University Malaya Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Shanggar Kuppusamy","author_inst":"University of Malaya Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Tom Devlin","author_inst":"Sensory Cloud"},{"author_name":"Brandon J.

We evaluated the time-to-event relationship between hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and COVID-19 outcomes. Design: We analyzed data from the prospective Dutch COVID-PREDICT cohort, an ongoing prospective study of patients admitted for COVID-19 infection. Setting: Patients from 8 participating hospitals, including two university hospitals from the COVID-PREDICT cohort were included. Participants: Admitted, adult patients with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or high suspicion based on CT-imaging of the thorax. Patients were followed for major outcomes during hospitalization. CVD risk factors were established via home medication lists and divided in antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, and antidiabetics. Primary and secondary outcomes measures: The primary outcome was mortality during the first 21 days following admission, secondary outcomes consisted of ICU-admission and ICU-mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analyses were used to determine the association with CVD risk factors. Results: We included 1604 patients with a mean age of 66+-15 of whom 60.5% were men. Antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, and antidiabetics were used by 45%, 34.7%, and 22.1% of patients. After adjustment for age and sex, the presence of [&ge;]2 risk factors was associated with increased mortality risk (HR 1.52, 95%CI 1.15-2.02), but not with ICU-admission. Moreover, the use of [&ge;]2 antidiabetics and [&ge;]2 antihypertensives was associated with mortality independent of age and sex with HRs of respectively 2.09 (95%CI 1.55-2.80) and 1.46 (95%CI 1.11-1.91). Conclusions: The accumulation of hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes leads to a stepwise increased risk for short-term mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients independent of age and sex. Further studies investigating how these risk factors disproportionately affect COVID-19 patients are warranted.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Didier Collard","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Nick S.

The extent of that increased risk compared to the general population and the groups most at risk have not been extensively studied. Methods: A prospective observational study of health and social care workers in NHS Tayside (Scotland, UK) from May to September 2020. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Patients provided clinical information including demographics and workplace information. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general Tayside population, were studied for comparison. Results: A total of 2062 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. The participants were predominantly female (81.7%) and 95.2% were white. 299 healthcare workers had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). Healthcare workers therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.85-6.16, p<0.0001). Dentists, healthcare assistants and porters were the job roles most likely to test positive. Those working in front-line roles with COVID-19 patients were more likely to test positive (17.4% vs. 13.4%, p=0.02). 97.1% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR had positive antibodies, compared to 11.8% of individuals with a symptomatic illness who had tested negative. Anosmia was the symptom most associated with the presence of detectable antibodies. Conclusion: In this study, healthcare workers were three times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. The seroprevalence data in different populations identified in this study will be useful to protect healthcare staff during future waves of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hani Abo-Leyah","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Gallant","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Diane Cassidy","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Yan Hui Giam","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Justin Killick","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Beth Marshall","author_inst":"NHS Tayside"},{"author_name":"Gordon Hay","author_inst":"NHS Tayside"},{"author_name":"Thomas Pembridge","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Rachel Strachan","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Natalie Gallant","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Parcell","author_inst":"NHS Tayside"},{"author_name":"Jacob George","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Furrie","author_inst":"NHS Tayside"},{"author_name":"James Duncan Chalmers","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Bert-Jan H. van den Born","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.01.20205088","rel_title":"Circulating levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are lower in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-10-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.01.20205088","rel_abs":"Background: To better understand the biology of COVID-19, we have explored the behavior of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), an angiogenic, vasodilating, and immune modulating peptide, in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Methods: Levels of CGRP in the serum of 57 COVID-19 patients (24 asymptomatic, 23 hospitalized in the general ward, and 10 admitted to the intensive care unit) and healthy donors (n=24) were measured by ELISA. In addition, to better understand the physiological consequences of the observed variations, we investigated by immunofluorescence the distribution of RAMP1, one of the components of the CGRP receptor, in autopsy lung specimens. Results: CGRP levels greatly decreased in COVID-19 patients (p<0.001) when compared to controls, and there were no significant differences due to disease severity, sex, age, or comorbidities. We found that COVID-19 patients treated with proton pump inhibitors had lower levels of CGRP than other patients not taking this treatment (p=0.001). RAMP1 immunoreactivity was found in smooth muscle cells of large blood vessels and the bronchial tree, and in the airways epithelium. In COVID-19 samples, RAMP1 was also found in proliferating type II pneumocytes, a common finding in these patients. Conclusions: The lower levels of CGRP should negatively impact the respiratory physiology of COVID-19 patients due to vasoconstriction, improper angiogenesis, less epithelial repair, and faulty immune response. Therefore, restoring CGRP levels in these patients may represent a novel therapeutic approach for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Ochoa-Callejero","author_inst":"CIBIR"},{"author_name":"Josune Garcia-Sanmartin","author_inst":"CIBIR"},{"author_name":"Pablo Villoslada-Blanco","author_inst":"CIBIR"},{"author_name":"Maria Iniguez","author_inst":"CIBIR"},{"author_name":"Patricia Perez-Matute","author_inst":"CIBIR"},{"author_name":"Rachel Brody","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Increased understanding about these patterns could be informative about the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Methods Results from PCR diagnostics for the seasonal coronaviruses, and other respiratory viruses, were obtained for 55,190 clinical samples analyzed at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, between 14 September 2009 and 2 April 2020. Results Seasonal coronaviruses were detected in 2,130 samples (3.9%). OC43 was most commonly detected (28.4% of detections), followed by NL63 (24.0%), HKU1 (17.6%), and 229E (15.3%). The overall fraction of positive samples was relatively similar between seasons. In contrast, at species level there was distinct pattern of biennial alternating peak seasons for the Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and the Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, respectively. The Betacoronaviruses peaked earlier in the winter season (Dec-Jan) than the Alphacoronaviruses (Feb-Mar). Coronaviruses were detected across all ages, but diagnostics were more frequently requested for paediatric patients than adults and the elderly. The species showed different age distributions, with OC43 and 229E positivity being relatively constant across age strata, while the incidence of NL63 and HKU1 decreased with age. Conclusions Both the Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses showed alternating biennial winter incidence peaks, which suggests some type of immune mediated interaction.

This interim report includes data from the fifth round of data collection currently underway for swabs sampled from the 18th to 26th September 2020. Methods: Repeated cross-sectional surveys of random samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 160,000 people in each round of data collection. Collection of self-administered nose and throat swab for PCR and questionnaire data. Prevalence of swab-positivity by round and by demographic variables including age, sex, region, ethnicity. Estimation of reproduction number (R) between and within rounds, and time trends using exponential growth or decay model. Assessment of geographical clustering based on boundary-free spatial model. Results: Over the 9 days for which data are available, we find 363 positives from 84,610 samples giving a weighted prevalence to date of 0.55% (0.47%, 0.64%) in round 5. This implies that 411,000 (351,000, 478,000) people in England are virus-positive under the assumption that the swab assay is 75% sensitive. Using data from the most recent two rounds, we estimate a doubling time of 10.6 (9.4, 12.0) days covering the period 20th August to 26th September, corresponding to a reproduction number R of 1.47 (1.40, 1.53). Using data only from round 5 we estimate a reproduction number of 1.06 (0.74, 1.46) with probability of 63% that R is greater than 1. Between rounds 4 and 5 there was a marked increase in unweighted prevalence at all ages. In the most recent data, prevalence was highest in the 18 to 24 yrs age group at 0.96% (0.68%, 1.36%). At 65+ yrs prevalence increased ~7-fold between rounds 4 and 5 from 0.04% (0.03%, 0.07%) to 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Prevalence increased in all regions between rounds 4 and 5, giving the highest unweighted prevalence in round 5 in the North West at 0.86% (0.69%, 1.06%). In London, prevalence increased ~5-fold from 0.10% (0.06%, 0.17%) to 0.49% (0.36%, 0.68%). Regional R values ranged from 1.32 (1.16,1.50) in Yorkshire and the Humber to 1.63 (1.42, 1.88) in the East Midlands over the same period. In the most recent data, there was extensive clustering in the North West, Midlands and in and around London with pockets of clustering in other regions including the South West, North East and East of England. Odds of swab-positivity were ~2-fold higher in people of Asian and Black ethnicity compared with white participants. Conclusion: Rapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England among all regions and age groups, including those age groups at highest risk. Although there is evidence of a recent deceleration in the epidemic, current levels of prevalence will inevitably result in additional hospitalisations and mortality in coming weeks. A re-doubling of public health efforts is needed to return to a declining phase of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Kylie E.

As an example in Japan, the number of people infected with the seasonal influenza, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), which are the seasonal infectious diseases in the 2020 season, has decreased remarkably compared to the number of people infected each year. It is believed that the significant reduction in the number of people infected with these seasonal infectious diseases is a result of the pervasive hand washing, wearing masks and maintaining social distance in COVID-19 rea. To examine the correlation between the three factors of the number of people with each seasonal infectious disease, the mask wearing rate, and the outing rate, we created a three-dimensional scatter plot based on these three factors using principal component analysis.

Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 from reported cases is challenging due to heterogeneous testing rates. We estimated the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil on a national and regional level using digital technology. Methods: We used a web-based application to perform a population-based survey from March 21st to August 29th, 2020 in Brazil. We obtained responses from 243 461 individuals across all federative units, who answered questions on COVID-19-related symptoms, chronic diseases and address of residence. COVID-19 was defined as at least one of the following: fever, cough, dyspnea and nasal flaring, associated with a history of close contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days. A stratified two-stage weighted survey analysis was performed to estimate the population level prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Results: After calibration weighing, we estimated that 10 339 461 cases of COVID-19 occurred, yielding a 2.75 estimated infection per officially reported case. Estimated\/reported ratios varied across Brazilian states and were higher in states with lower human development indexes. Areas with lower income levels displayed higher rates of COVID-19 cases (66 vs 38 cases\/1000 people in the lowest and highest income strata respectively, p<0.001), but presented lower rates of COVID-19 testing. Conclusion: In this population-based survey using digital technology in Brazil, we estimated that the COVID-19 case rates were 2.75 times higher than officially reported. The estimated per reported case ratios were higher in areas with worse socioeconomic status.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Faissal Nemer Hajar","author_inst":"Federal University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Miguel Morita Fernandes-Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Gustavo S.

Here we report a novel Oil Immersed Lossless Total Analysis System (OIL-TAS), which integrates RNA extraction and detection onto a single device that is simple, rapid, cost effective, uses minimal supplies and requires reduced infrastructure to perform. We validated the performance of OIL-TAS using contrived samples containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, which show that the assay can reliably detect an input concentration of 10 copies\/L and sporadically detect down to 1 copy\/L. The OIL-TAS method can serve as a faster, cheaper, and easier-to-deploy alternative to current qPCR-based methods for infectious disease testing.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Duane S Juang","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Terry D Juang","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Dawn M Dudley","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Christina M Newman","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David J Beebe","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Peter J.

Given prior research linking rumor exposure to mental well-being, we conducted a nation-wide survey to document the base rate of rumor exposure and factors associated with rumor vulnerability. Between March to July 2020, 1237 participants were surveyed on 5 widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors (that drinking water frequently could be preventive, that eating garlic could be preventive, that the outbreak arose because of bat soup consumption, that the virus was created in an American lab, and that the virus was created in a Chinese lab). For each rumor, participants reported whether they had heard, shared or believed each rumor. Although most participants had been exposed to COVID-19 rumors, few shared or believed these. Sharing behaviors sometimes occurred in the absence of belief; however, education emerged as a protective factor for both sharing and belief. Together, our results suggest that campaigns targeting skills associated with higher education (e.g. epistemology) may prove more effective than counter-rumor messages.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Victoria Jane En Long","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Wei Shien Koh","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Young Ern Saw","author_inst":"Yale-NUS College"},{"author_name":"Jean CJ Liu","author_inst":"Yale-NUS College"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David J Beebe","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Peter J.

Thus, forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic became a key research interest for both the epidemiologists and statisticians. These future predictions are useful for the effective allocation of health care resources, stockpiling, and help in strategic planning for clinicians, government authorities, and public-health policymakers after understanding the extent of the effect. The main objective of this paper is to develop the most suitable forecasting model that can generate real-time short-term (ten days) and long-term (fifty days) out-of-sample forecasts of COVID-19 outbreaks for eight profoundly affected countries, namely the United States of America, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Spain, and Iran. A novel hybrid approach based on the Theta model and Autoregressive neural network (ARNN) model, named Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model, is proposed. The proposed method outperforms previously available single and hybrid forecasting models for COVID-19 predictions in most data sets. In addition, the ergodicity and asymptotic stationarity of the proposed TARNN model are established which is of particular interest in nonlinear time series literature.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"TANUJIT CHAKRABORTY","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute"},{"author_name":"Arinjita Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Louisville, Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Monalisha Pattnaik","author_inst":"Sambalpur University, India"},{"author_name":"Jean CJ Liu","author_inst":"Yale-NUS College"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David J Beebe","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Peter J.

Due to pauci-symptomatic cases, the virus may spread invisibly in a community. In the absence of vaccination, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like interpersonal distancing were implemented in several countries and have been key to effectively reduce viral spreading. In Germany after an exponential growth of case numbers in March 2020, NPIs were able to effectively control the pandemic and sufficiently reduced the daily reported new infections allowing for partial release of NPIs. We developed a novel statistical method to evaluate contacts between individuals, which is essential for virus transmission. We derived the contact index, an index for the intensity and heterogeneity of contact behavior from spatial proximity between individuals as proxy for physical interaction based on complex network science. We estimated the contact index from large-scale GPS mobile phone data of 1.15 to 1.4 million users in Germany per day (March to July 2020). A high correlation between the contact index and the effective reproduction number six days later could be observed (Pearson correlation r=0.96, P-value < 0.001 for all reported Pearson correlations). This correlation was observed in three different phases of the virus spread in Germany 1) the early phase of the first wave with the highest reproduction rate, 2) phase of strict NPIs (lockdown) with the lowest reproduction, 3) release of NPIs accompanied with an increase of reproduction. The results show that the contact index is able to model and potentially forecast the time evolution of the pandemic in Germany.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sten Ruediger","author_inst":"NET CHECK GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Konigorski","author_inst":"Hasso-Plattner Institut"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Edelman","author_inst":"Hasso-Plattner Institut"},{"author_name":"Detlef Zernick","author_inst":"NET CHECK GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Lippert","author_inst":"Hasso-Plattner Institut"},{"author_name":"Alexander Henry Thieme","author_inst":"Charite"},{"author_name":"David J Beebe","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Peter J.

But, why should the testing stop at direct contacts, and not test secondary, tertiary contacts or even contacts further down? The question arises because by the time an infected individual is tested the infection starting from him may have infected a chain of individuals. One deterrent in testing long chains of individuals right away may be that it substantially increases the testing load, or does it? We investigate the costs and benefits of testing the contact chain of an individual who tests positive and discover that it can both substantially reduce the cumulative infection count over time and reduce the testing load over time. We also discover a phenomenon of diminishing return beyond a threshold value on the depth of the chain to be tested in one go, the threshold then provides the most desirable tradeoff between benefit in terms of reducing the cumulative infection count and cost in terms of increasing the testing load.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jungyeol Kim","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Xingran Chen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Saswati Sarkar","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Nicholas F Brazeau","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Widyastuti Widyastuti","author_inst":"Jakarta Provincial Department of Health, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Dwi Oktavia","author_inst":"Jakarta Provincial Department of Health, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Verry Adrian","author_inst":"Jakarta Provincial Department of Health, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Ngabila Salama","author_inst":"Jakarta Provincial Department of Health, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta Bhatia","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Pierre Nouvellet","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; School of Lif"},{"author_name":"Ellie Sherrard-Smith","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas S Churcher","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Henry Surendra","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Rosa N Lina","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Lenny L Ekawati","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Karina D Lestari","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Adhi Andrianto","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University"},{"author_name":"J Kevin Baird","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia; Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Azra C Ghani","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Iqbal RF Elyazar","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Patrick GT Walker","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.30.20203844","rel_title":"A One-Minute Blood Test to Monitor Immune Responses in COVID-19 Patients and Predict Clinical Risks of Developing Moderate to Severe Symptoms","rel_date":"2020-10-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.30.20203844","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought enormous loss and interruption to human life and the global economy since the first outbreak reported in China between late 2019 to early 2020, and will likely remain a public health threat in the months and years to come. Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, most people will develop no or mild symptoms, however, a small percentage of the population will become severely ill, require hospitalization, intensive care, and some succumb to death. The current knowledge of COVID-19 disease progression with worsening symptom complex implicates the critical importance of identifying patients with high clinical risk compared to those who would be at lower risk for disease control and patient management with better therapeutic output. Currently no clinical test is available that can predict risk factors and immune status change at different severity scales. The immune system plays a critical role in the defense against infectious diseases. Extensive research has found that COVID-19 patients with poor clinical outcomes differ significantly in their immune responses to the virus from those who exhibit milder symptoms. We previously developed a nanoparticle-enabled blood test that can detect the humoral immune status change in animals. In this study, we applied this new test to analyze the immune response in relation to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. From the testing of 153 COVID-19 patient samples and 142 negative controls, we detected statistically significant differences between COVID-19 patients with no or mild symptoms from those who developed moderate to severe symptoms. Mechanistic study suggests that these differences are associated with type 1 versus type 2 immune responses. We conclude that this new rapid test could potentially become a valuable clinical tool for COVID-19 patient risk stratification and management.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chirajyoti Deb","author_inst":"Orlando Health"},{"author_name":"Allan N Salinas","author_inst":"Orlando Health"},{"author_name":"Aurea Middleton","author_inst":"Orlando Health"},{"author_name":"Katelyn Kern","author_inst":"Orlando Health"},{"author_name":"Daleen Penoyer","author_inst":"Orlando Health"},{"author_name":"Rahul Borsadia","author_inst":"Orlando Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Hunley","author_inst":"OrlandoHealth"},{"author_name":"Vijay Mehta","author_inst":"Orlando Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Irastorza","author_inst":"Orlando Health"},{"author_name":"Devendra I Mehta","author_inst":"Orlando Health"},{"author_name":"Tianyu Zheng","author_inst":"Nano Discovery Inc."},{"author_name":"QUN HUO","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Thomas S Churcher","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Henry Surendra","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Rosa N Lina","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Lenny L Ekawati","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Karina D Lestari","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Adhi Andrianto","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University"},{"author_name":"J Kevin Baird","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia; Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Azra C Ghani","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Iqbal RF Elyazar","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Patrick GT Walker","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.02.323915","rel_title":"A Multiscale Coarse-grained Model of the SARS-CoV-2 Virion","rel_date":"2020-10-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.02.323915","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer simulations of complete viral particles can provide theoretical insights into large-scale viral processes including assembly, budding, egress, entry, and fusion. Detailed atomistic simulations, however, are constrained to shorter timescales and require billion-atom simulations for these processes. Here, we report the current status and on-going development of a largely \"bottom-up\" coarse-grained (CG) model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Structural data from a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), x-ray crystallography, and computational predictions were used to build molecular models of structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which were then assembled into a complete virion model. We describe how CG molecular interactions can be derived from all-atom simulations, how viral behavior difficult to capture in atomistic simulations can be incorporated into the CG models, and how the CG models can be iteratively improved as new data becomes publicly available. Our initial CG model and the detailed methods presented are intended to serve as a resource for researchers working on COVID-19 who are interested in performing multiscale simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study reports the construction of a molecular model for the SARS-CoV-2 virion and details our multiscale approach towards model refinement.

Here, we report the first HLA-I immunopeptidome of SARS-CoV-2 in two human cell lines at different times post-infection using mass spectrometry. We found HLA-I peptides derived not only from canonical ORFs, but also from internal out-of-frame ORFs in Spike and Nucleoprotein not captured by current vaccines. Proteomics analyses of infected cells revealed that SARS-CoV-2 may interfere with antigen processing and immune signaling pathways. Based on the endogenously processed and presented viral peptides that we identified, we estimate that a pool of 24 peptides would provide one or more peptides for presentation by at least one HLA allele in 99% of the human population.

Here, we have developed a safe single round rhabdovirus replicon vaccine platform for enhanced presentation of the S receptor-binding domain (RBD). Structure-guided design was employed to build a chimeric minispike comprising the globular RBD linked to a transmembrane stem-anchor sequence derived from rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (G). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and RABV replicons encoding the minispike not only allowed expression of the antigen at the cell surface but also incorporation into the envelope of secreted non-infectious particles, thus combining classic vector-driven antigen expression and particulate virus-like particle (VLP) presentation. A single dose of a prototype replicon vaccine, VSV{Delta}G-minispike-eGFP (G), stimulated high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in mice, equivalent to those found in COVID-19 patients. Boost immunization with the identical replicon further enhanced neutralizing activity.

In June 2020, all African countries registered human infections with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe virus is mutating steadily and this is monitored by a well curated database of viral nucleotide sequences from samples taken from infected individual thus enabling phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic associations.\n\nMethodsWe downloaded from the GISAID database, SARS-CoV-2 sequences established from four West African countries Ghana, Gambia, Senegal and Nigeria and then performed phylogenetic analysis employing the nextstrain pipeline. Based on mutations found within the sequences we calculated and visualized statistics characterizing clades according to the GISAID nomenclature.\n\nResultsWe found country-specific patterns of viral clades: the later Europe-associated G-clades predominantly in Senegal and Gambia, and combinations of the earlier (L, S, V) and later clades in Ghana and Nigeria. Contrary to our expectations, the later Europe-associated G-clades emerged before the earlier clades. Detailed analysis of distinct samples showed that some of the earlier clades might have circulated latently and some reflect migration routes via Mali and Tunisia.\n\nConclusionsThe distinct patterns of viral clades in the West African countries point at its emergence from Europe and China via Asia and Europe. The observation that the later clades emerged before the earlier clades could be simply due to founder effects or due to latent circulation of the earlier clades.

Due to the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection to host cells and its pathogenesis remain largely unclear, there are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Besides severe respiratory and systematic symptoms, several comorbidities may also increase risk of fatal disease outcome. Therefore, it is required to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on pre-existing diseases of patients, such as cancer and other infectious diseases. In the current study, we have reported that SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins and some anti-COVID-19 drugs currently used are able to induce lytic reactivation of Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), one of major human oncogenic viruses through manipulation of intracellular signaling pathways. Our data indicate that those KSHV+ patients especially in endemic areas exposure to COVID-19 or undergoing the treatment may have increased risks to develop virus-associated cancers, even after they have fully recovered from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jungang Chen","author_inst":"UAMS"},{"author_name":"Lu Dai","author_inst":"UAMS"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Barrett","author_inst":"UAMS"},{"author_name":"Steven R Post","author_inst":"UAMS"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Qin","author_inst":"UAMS"},{"author_name":"Akio Yamashita","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan"},{"author_name":"- the Keio Donner Project","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Haruhiko Siomi","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Kensaku Murano","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Karl-Klaus Conzelmann","author_inst":"Max von Pettenkofer-Institute & Gene Center"},{"author_name":"Aharon Nachshon","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Matteo Gentili","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Keith D Rivera","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Derin B Keskin","author_inst":"Translational Immunogenomics Laboratory, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles M Rice","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Karl R Clauser","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Nir Hacohen","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Steven A Carr","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jennifer G Abelin","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Mohsan Saeed","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Iqbal RF Elyazar","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Patrick GT Walker","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20202846","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with aggressive haematological malignancies","rel_date":"2020-10-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20202846","rel_abs":"The development of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is an indicator of seroprevalence and may afford protection from infection. It has been presumed that antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will be impaired in patients with aggressive haematological malignancy (PHM) due to underlying immunological dysfunction caused by malignancy or systemic anti-cancer treatment (SACT), placing them at increased risk. Here we analysed longitudinal serum samples from ten hospitalised PHM with aggressive disease and on SACT, collected up to 103 days post-onset of COVID-19 symptoms. We found that the majority (8\/9) of PHM with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconverted and developed antibodies to the major SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1 and N) with most (6\/8) produced neutralising antibody responses. Furthermore, the dynamics of antibody responses were broadly similar to that reported for the general population, except for a possible delay to seroconversion. Our finding that PHM on SACT can make functional antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 has important implications for patient management and serological monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk groups.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luke Muir","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jiexin Zheng","author_inst":"University College London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chloe Rees-Spear","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Annachiara Rosa","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute, London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Earl","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute, London"},{"author_name":"Peter Cherepanov","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute, London"},{"author_name":"Rajeev Gupta","author_inst":"University College London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Asim Khwaja","author_inst":"University College London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Clare Jolly","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura E McCoy","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Aharon Nachshon","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Matteo Gentili","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Keith D Rivera","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Derin B Keskin","author_inst":"Translational Immunogenomics Laboratory, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles M Rice","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Karl R Clauser","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Nir Hacohen","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Steven A Carr","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jennifer G Abelin","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Mohsan Saeed","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Iqbal RF Elyazar","author_inst":"Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Patrick GT Walker","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20201509","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in a UK population: detectable IgG for up to 20 weeks post infection.","rel_date":"2020-10-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20201509","rel_abs":"Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic necessitated rapid and global responses across all areas of healthcare, including an unprecedented interest in serological immunoassays to detect antibodies to the virus. The dynamics of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is still not well understood. Methods We measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma samples from 880 people in Northern Ireland by Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/IgA\/IgM, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and EuroImmun IgG SARS-CoV-2 ELISA immunoassays to analyse immune dynamics over time. Using these results, we develop a \"pseudo gold standard\" reference cohort against which to assess immunoassay performance. We report performance metrics for the UK-RTC AbC-19 rapid lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) against a characterised panel of 304 positives established using the \"pseudo gold standard\" system and 350 negative samples. Results We detect persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG up to 140 days (20 weeks) post infection, across all three antibody immunoassays, at levels up to 4.4 times the cut-off for a positive result by Roche measurement. Using our \"pseudo gold standard\" cohort (n=348 positive, n=510 negative) we determine the sensitivity and specificity of the three commercial immunoassays used (EuroImmun; Sens. 98.9% [97.7-99.7%]; Spec. 99.2% [98.4-99.8%]; Roche; Sens. 99.4% [98.6-100%]; Spec. (96.7% [95.1-98.2%]; Abbott; Sens. 86.8% [83.1-90.2%]; Spec. (99.2% [98.4-99.8%]). The UK-RTC AbC-19 lateral flow immunoassay using shows a sensitivity of 97.70% (95.72%-99.34%) and specificity of 100% (100.00-100.00%). Conclusions Through comprehensive analysis of a large cohort of pre-pandemic and pandemic individuals, we show detectable levels of IgG antibodies, lasting up to 140 days, providing insight to immunity levels at later time points. We propose an alternative to RT-PCR positive status as a standard for assessing SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays and show strong performance metrics for the AbC-19 rapid test.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise J Robertson","author_inst":"Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, Ulster University, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Julie S Moore","author_inst":"Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, Ulster University, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kevin Blighe","author_inst":"Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, Ulster University, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kok Yew Ng","author_inst":"Nanotechnology and Integrated Bioengineering Centre, Ulster University, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Nigel Quinn","author_inst":"Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory, Southern Health and Social Care Trust, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Fergal Jennings","author_inst":"Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory, Southern Health and Social Care Trust, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Gary Warnock","author_inst":"Microbiology Laboratory, Southern Health and Social Care Trust, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Peter Sharpe","author_inst":"Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory, Southern Health and Social Care Trust, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Mark Clarke","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service, Belfast City Hospital, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Maguire","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service, Belfast City Hospital, Northern"},{"author_name":"Sharon Rainey","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service, Belfast City Hospital, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ruth Price","author_inst":"Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, Ulster University, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"William Burns","author_inst":"Nanotechnology and Integrated Bioengineering Centre, Ulster University, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Amanda Kowalczyk","author_inst":"Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, Ulster University, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Agnes Awuah","author_inst":"Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, Ulster University, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Sara McNamee","author_inst":"Nanotechnology and Integrated Bioengineering Centre, Ulster University, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Gayle Wallace","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, Northern Ireland."},{"author_name":"Steve Sager","author_inst":"Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, Ulster University, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Connie Chao Shern","author_inst":"Avellino, 1505 Adams Dr, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States"},{"author_name":"M.

Currently there are no effective antiviral and\/or anti-inflammatory therapies. Here we demonstrate that 2019 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (CoV2-S1) induces high levels of NF-{kappa}B activations, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mild epithelial damage, in human bronchial epithelial cells. CoV2-S1-induced NF-{kappa}B activation requires S1 interaction with human ACE2 receptor and early activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and associated unfolded protein response (UPR), and MAP kinase signalling pathways. We developed an antagonistic peptide that inhibits S1-ACE2 interaction and CoV2-S1-induced productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The existing FDA-approved ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenylburic acid (4-PBA), and MAP kinase inhibitors, trametinib and ulixertinib, ameliorated CoV2-S1-induced inflammation and epithelial damage. These novel data highlight the potentials of peptide-based antivirals for novel ACE2-utilising CoVs, while repurposing existing drugs may be used as treatments to dampen elevated inflammation and lung injury mediated by SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alan C-Y.
