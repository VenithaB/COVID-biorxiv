To acquire the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 in Guizhou, China, we collected data on 162 laboratory-confirmed cases related to COVID-19. We described the demographic characteristics of the cases and estimated the incubation period, serial interval and basic reproduction number. We also presented two representative case studies in Guizhou province -- Case Study 1 was an example of asymptomatic carrier; and Case Study 2 was an example of a large and complex infection chain that involved four different districts spanning three provinces and eight families. With an estimation of 8 days incubation period and 6 days serial interval, our results indicate that there may exist infectiousness during the incubation period for 2019-nCoV. This increases the difficulty of screening or identifying cases related to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaike Ping","author_inst":"Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.20026005","rel_title":"Transmission and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in 104 outside-Wuhan patients, China","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.04.20026005","rel_abs":"Background: Cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emigrated from Wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities. This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. Methods: Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Results: Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 &ldquo:generations\" was observed. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years (including 3 children) and 49 (47.12%) were male. Most patients had typical symptoms, 5 asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives. The median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1-32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days. Just 9 of 16 severe patients required ICU care. Until Feb 12, 2020, 40 (38.46%) discharged and 1 (0.96%) died. For the antiviral treatment, 80 (76.92%) patients received traditional Chinese medicine therapy. Conclusions: Family but not community transmission occupied the main body of infections in the two centers. Asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us that it may bring more risk to the spread of COVID-19. The incubation period of 8 patients exceeded 14 days.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chengfeng Qiu","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Huaihua"},{"author_name":"Qian Xiao","author_inst":"Shaoyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Liao","author_inst":"Affiliated Shaoyang Hospital of University of South China"},{"author_name":"Ziwei Deng","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Huaihua"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Liu","author_inst":"Shaoyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuanlu Shu","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Huaihua"},{"author_name":"Dinghui Zhou","author_inst":"Shaoyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ye Deng","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Huaihua"},{"author_name":"Hongqiang Wang","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Huaihua"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhao","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Huaihua"},{"author_name":"Jianliang Zhou","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Huaihua"},{"author_name":"Jin Wang","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Huaihua"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Shi","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Huaihua"},{"author_name":"Long Da","author_inst":"Shaoyang Central Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.20029439","rel_title":"ddPCR: a more sensitive and accurate tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection in low viral load specimens","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.20029439","rel_abs":"Real time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, due to the low viral load in patient throats and the limitations of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which results in failure to timely diagnose, early treat, cut off transmission, and assess discharge criteria. To improve this situation, an optimized droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the limit of detection of ddPCR is significantly lower than that of RT-PCR. We further explored the feasibility of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from 77 clinical throat swab samples, including 63 suspected outpatients with fever and 14 supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment, and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the diagnostic accuracy. In this double-blind study, we tested, surveyed subsequently and statistically analyzed 77 clinical samples. According to our study, 26 samples from COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR negative were detected as positive by ddPCR. No FPRs of RT-PCR and ddPCR were observed. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, NLR and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27-55%), 100% (95% CI: 54-100%), 100%, 16% (95% CI: 13-19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48-0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33-60%) for RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83-99%), 100% (95% CI: 48-100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36-83%), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.18) and 95% (95% CI: 84-99%) for ddPCR, respectively. Moreover, 14 (42.9 %) convalescents still carry detectable SARS-CoV-2 after discharge. Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR. It also suggests that the current clinical practice that the convalescent after discharge continues to be quarantined for at least 2 weeks is completely necessary which can prevent potential viral transmission.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tao Suo","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.

Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. Conclusions: To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hui Wan","author_inst":"Jiangsu Key Laboratory for NSLSCS, School of Mathematics, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, P.R.

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Moritz U.G.

While China - were the outbreak started - seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically refers to the situation in Spain as of February 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second-order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Aleta","author_inst":"ISI Foundation,Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Yamir Moreno","author_inst":"University of Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Gutierrez","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Chieh-Hsi Wu","author_inst":"Mathematical Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Brennan Klein","author_inst":"Network Science Institute, Northeastern University, Boston, United States"},{"author_name":"David M.

Combining the advantages of target amplification and long-read, real-time nanopore sequencing, we developed nanopore target sequencing (NTS) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously within 6-10 h. Parallel testing with approved qPCR kits of SARS-CoV-2 and NTS using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected COVID-19 cases confirmed that NTS identified more infected patients as positive, and could also monitor for mutated nucleic acid sequence or other respiratory virus infection in the test sample. NTS is thus suitable for contemporary COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, this platform can be further extended for diagnosing other viruses or pathogens.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Aisi Fu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery, Ministry of Education and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ben Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery, Ministry of Education and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yongqing Tong","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ran Liu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery, Ministry of Education and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jiashuang Gu","author_inst":"Wuhan Dgensee Clinical Laboratory Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jianghao Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Dgensee Clinical Laboratory Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Wen Jiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Dgensee Clinical Laboratory Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Gaigai Shen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery, Ministry of Education and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wanxu Zhao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery, Ministry of Education and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dong Men","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University."},{"author_name":"Zixin Deng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery, Ministry of Education and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Tiangang Liu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery, Ministry of Education and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases Unit, Institut Pasteur, UMR2000, CNRS, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pybus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.

While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, \"MyCoV\", which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution.\n\nImportance StatementThe analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package  MyCoV which classifies user generated sequences.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Arthur Wilkinson","author_inst":"UMR Processus Infectieux en Milieu Insulaire Tropical"},{"author_name":"L\u00e9a Joffrin","author_inst":"University of Reunion Island UMR PIMIT (Processus Infectieux en Milieu Insulaire Tropical) INSERM 1187, CNRS 9192, IRD 249;"},{"author_name":"Camille Lebarbenchon","author_inst":"University of Reunion Island"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mavingui","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de La R\u00e9union.

Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for HCoV-191,2, the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. RmYN02 shared 93.3% nucleotide identity with HCoV-19 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene in which it was the closest relative of HCoV-19. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to HCoV-19, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur in nature. Together, these data suggest that HCoV-19 originated from multiple naturally occurring recombination events among those viruses present in bats and other wildlife species.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Zhou","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xing Chen","author_inst":"Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tao Hu","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Juan Li","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hao Song","author_inst":"Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yanran Liu","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peihan Wang","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Di Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Edward C.

The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. The alternating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions described in this paper may help elucidating the biological roles of these proteins as far as protein-protein interactions are concerned.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ibne Raihan Zunaid","author_inst":"IBIO Ltd, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Stefania Pacini","author_inst":"Silver Spring Sagl"},{"author_name":"Marco Ruggiero","author_inst":"Silver Spring Sagl"},{"author_name":"Juan Li","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hao Song","author_inst":"Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yanran Liu","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peihan Wang","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Di Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Edward C.

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 21 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qifang Bi","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Chenfei Ye","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shaun A Truelove","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tong Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Suli Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Juncen Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Teijian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.

Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yonghua Wu","author_inst":"Northeast Normal University, China"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Chenfei Ye","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shaun A Truelove","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tong Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Suli Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Juncen Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Teijian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.

But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 to summarize the characteristics of the COVID-19 registered clinical trials. Methods: This study is based on the recommendations of the PRISMA in the Cochrane handbook. The databases from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two researchers independently selected the literature based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. Results: A total of 75 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) of COVID-19 were obtained. A majority of clinical trials were sponsored by Chinese hospitals. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and none of the registered clinical trials had been completed; 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or in a pre-experiment stage, 15 trials belonged to phrase and 4 trials were phrase . The methods of intervention included traditional Chinese medicine involving 26 trials, Western medicine involving 30 trials, and integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine involving 19 trials. The subjects were mainly non-critical adult patients ([&ge;] 18 years old). The median sample size of the trials was 100 (IQR: 60 - 200), and the median execute time of the trials was 179 d (IQR: 94 - 366 d). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examinations. Overall, both the methodology quality of interventional trials and observational studies were low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine are ongoing or will being carried out in China. However, based on the low methodology quality and small sample size and long studies execute time, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment in the near future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of COVID-19 in China.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yonghua Wu","author_inst":"Northeast Normal University, China"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Chenfei Ye","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shaun A Truelove","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tong Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Suli Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Juncen Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Teijian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the severe pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China. Method: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia. Results: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-severe pneumonia. Statistical analysis showed that advanced age, an increase of D-dimer, and a decrease of lymphocytes were characteristics of the patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, in the early stage of the disease, chest CT scans of patients with the severe pneumonia showed the illness can progress rapidly. Conclusions: Advanced age, lymphocyte decline, and D-dimer elevation are important characteristics of patients with severe pneumonia. Clinicians should focus on these characteristics to identify high-risk patients at an early stage.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yafei Wang","author_inst":"The central hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhou","author_inst":"The central hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Zhen Yang","author_inst":"The central hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Dongping Xia","author_inst":"The central hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Shuang Geng","author_inst":"The central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shaun A Truelove","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tong Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Suli Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Juncen Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Teijian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.

A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039]. Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially nFLNs, and GP under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19. Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat VT in medical staff and GP are extremely necessary.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhenyu Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jingwu Ge","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Meiling Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Feng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mei Qiao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Riyue Jiang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiangjiang Bi","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gaofeng Zhan","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Xu","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Long Wang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chenliang Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yinbing Pan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shijiang Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,"},{"author_name":"Yimin Hu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Changzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Hashimoto","author_inst":"Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Yan Jia","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haofei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cunming Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.20029413","rel_title":"The spatiotemporal estimation of the dynamic risk and the international transmission of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A global perspective","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.20029413","rel_abs":"An ongoing novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infection outbreak called COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective. We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country's vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19. Countries' vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries' management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic. * Note: This study was completed on February 15, 2020.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuan-Chien Lin","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, National Central University"},{"author_name":"Wan-Ju Chi","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, National Central University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ting Lin","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, National Central University"},{"author_name":"Chun-Yeh Lai","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, National Central University"},{"author_name":"Mei Qiao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Riyue Jiang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiangjiang Bi","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gaofeng Zhan","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Xu","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Long Wang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chenliang Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yinbing Pan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shijiang Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,"},{"author_name":"Yimin Hu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Changzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Hashimoto","author_inst":"Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Yan Jia","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haofei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cunming Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.20029561","rel_title":"A simple model to assess Wuhan lock-down effect and region efforts during COVID-19 epidemic in China Mainland","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.20029561","rel_abs":"Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland.

Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model.

Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the same as SARS-CoV. The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes. Our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pancreatic injury in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that pancreatitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection should also be paid attention in clinical work.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Furong Liu","author_inst":"Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Xin Long","author_inst":"Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Zou","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Minghao Fang","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjuan Wu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Jin Yin-tan Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Bixiang Zhang","author_inst":"Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wanguang Zhang","author_inst":"Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Chen","author_inst":"Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Zhanguo Zhang","author_inst":"Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chenliang Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yinbing Pan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shijiang Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,"},{"author_name":"Yimin Hu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Changzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Hashimoto","author_inst":"Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Yan Jia","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haofei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cunming Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.03.962332","rel_title":"Multi-epitope vaccine design using an immunoinformatics approach for 2019 novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2)","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.03.962332","rel_abs":"A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 9.2 million infection cases and 475758 deaths worldwide.

An in silico approach based on the available virus genome was applied to identify 19 high immunogenic B-cell epitopes and 499 human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. Thirty multi-epitope peptide vaccines were designed by iNeo Suite, and manufactured by solid-phase synthesis. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. When four vaccine peptide candidates from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were selected to immunize mice, a significantly larger amount of IgG in serum as well as an increase of CD19+ cells in ILNs was observed in peptide-immunized mice compared to the control mice. The ratio of IFN-{gamma}-secreting lymphocytes in CD4+ or CD8+ cells in the peptides-immunized mice were higher than that in the control mice. There were also a larger number of IFN-{gamma}-secreting T cells in spleen in the peptides-immunized mice. This study screened antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes in all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and further designed multi-epitope based peptide vaccine against viral structural proteins. The obtained vaccine peptides successfully elicited specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.

Due to the rapid dissemination and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. Different from the development approaches for traditional vaccines, the development of our peptide vaccine is faster and simpler. In this study, we performed an in silico approach to identify the antigenic B-cell epitopes and human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes, and designed a panel of multi-epitope peptide vaccines. The resulting SARS-CoV-2 multi-epitope peptide vaccine could elicit specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice efficiently, displaying its great potential in our fight of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ye Feng","author_inst":"Institute for Translational Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, China; Institute for Translational Medicine, Zhejiang University School o"},{"author_name":"Min Qiu","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Bio-Tech Ltd., Co"},{"author_name":"Liang Liu","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shengmei Zou","author_inst":"Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Institute for Translational Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yun Li","author_inst":"Zhejiang Forest Resources Monitoring Center, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Kai Luo","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Qianpeng Guo","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Ning Han","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yingqiang Sun","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Kui Wang","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xinlei Zhuang","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Zhang","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang California International Nanosystems Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqing Chen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang California Inter"},{"author_name":"Fan Mo","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Vancouver Prostate Centre"},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,"},{"author_name":"Yimin Hu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Changzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Hashimoto","author_inst":"Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Yan Jia","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haofei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cunming Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.20029421","rel_title":"An epidemiological forecast model and software assessing interventions on COVID-19 epidemic in China","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.20029421","rel_abs":"We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection using the public available data from the China CDC.

Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33\/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP [&ge;]20 mg\/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1*10^9\/L were independently related to hepatic injury. Conclusions: Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine storm in liver injury. Early detection and timely treatment of hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19 are necessary.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lu Li","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Li","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Manman Xu","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Liver Failure and Artificial Liver Treatment Research, Beijing, China, 100069"},{"author_name":"Sujun Zheng","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhongping Duan","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Liu","author_inst":"Hemodialysis Room, Urinary Center, Beijing  Youan  Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China,100069"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junfeng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Kui Wang","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xinlei Zhuang","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Zhang","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang California International Nanosystems Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqing Chen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang California Inter"},{"author_name":"Fan Mo","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Vancouver Prostate Centre"},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,"},{"author_name":"Yimin Hu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Changzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Hashimoto","author_inst":"Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Yan Jia","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haofei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cunming Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.973255","rel_title":"Evidence for RNA editing in the transcriptome of 2019 Novel Coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.973255","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global health risk and understanding the response of the host to the SARS-CoV-2 virus will help to contrast the disease. Editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against Coronaviruses. Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals mutational patterns compatible to those observed in the transcriptomic data. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in Coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.\n\nFor the casual ReaderJust to make a few things clear: - RNA editing and DNA editing are PHYSIOLOGICAL processes. Organisms uses them to (a) try to fight viruses, (b) increase heterogeneity inside cells (on many levels), (c) recognise their own RNA.\n- our work suggests that: (a) cells use RNA editing in trying to deal with Coronaviruses. We don't know to what extent they succeed (and it would be nice if we could help them). (b) Whatever happens, mutations inserted by RNA editing fuel viral evolution. We don't know whether viruses actively exploit this.\n- If you (scientist or not) think our work suggests ANYTHING ELSE, contact us.

We suggest a quick, simple, accurate aided detection method for the suspected patients and on-site screening in close contact with the population.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xingwang Jia","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Pengjun Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education\/Beijing), Interventional Therapy Department, Peking University Cancer Hospita"},{"author_name":"Yaping Tian","author_inst":"Department of Translational Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Junli Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Huadong Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Liu Jiao","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Zeyan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lijun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China."},{"author_name":"Haihong He","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Kunlun He","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of Biomedical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, C"},{"author_name":"Yajie Liu","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqing Chen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang California Inter"},{"author_name":"Fan Mo","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Vancouver Prostate Centre"},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,"},{"author_name":"Yimin Hu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Changzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Hashimoto","author_inst":"Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Yan Jia","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haofei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cunming Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.972935","rel_title":"Isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from the first US COVID-19 patient","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.972935","rel_abs":"The etiologic agent of the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan China was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in January, 2020. The first US patient was diagnosed by the State of Washington and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 20, 2020. We isolated virus from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens, and characterized the viral sequence, replication properties, and cell culture tropism. We found that the virus replicates to high titer in Vero-CCL81 cells and Vero E6 cells in the absence of trypsin. We also deposited the virus into two virus repositories, making it broadly available to the public health and research communities. We hope that open access to this important reagent will expedite development of medical countermeasures.\n\nArticle SummaryScientists have isolated virus from the first US COVID-19 patient. The isolation and reagents described here will serve as the US reference strain used in research, drug discovery and vaccine testing.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer Harcourt","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Lu","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shifaq Kamili","author_inst":"Synergy America Inc."},{"author_name":"Senthil Kumar Sakthivel","author_inst":"Eagle Contracting"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Wang","author_inst":"Synergy America Inc"},{"author_name":"Janna Murray","author_inst":"Synergy America Inc."},{"author_name":"Krista Queen","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Brian Lynch","author_inst":"Eagle Contracting"},{"author_name":"Brett Whitaker","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Tao","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevtion"},{"author_name":"Clinton Paden","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Eagle Contracting"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Anna Uehara","author_inst":"Orise"},{"author_name":"Haibin Wang","author_inst":"Eagle Contracting"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Goldsmith","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hannah Bullock","author_inst":"Synergy America Inc."},{"author_name":"Rashi Gautam","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Craig Schindewolf","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kumari G.
