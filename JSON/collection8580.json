SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been rapidly developed and quickly applied to clinical testing during the pandemic. However, studies evaluating the performance of these NAAT assays are limited. We evaluated the performance of four NAATs, which were marked by the Conformite Europeenne and widely used in China during the pandemic. Results showed that the analytical sensitivity of the four assays was significantly lower than that claimed by the NAAT manufacturers. The limit of detection (LOD) of Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs was 3000 copies\/mL, whereas the LOD of Bioperfectus NAATs was 4000 copies\/mL. The results of the consistency test using 46 samples showed that Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs could detect the samples with a specificity of 100% (30\/30) and a sensitivity of 100% (16 \/16), whereas Bioperfectus NAAT detected the samples with a specificity of 100% (30\/30) and a sensitivity 81.25% (13\/16). The sensitivity of Bioperfectus NAAT was lower than that of the three other NAATs; this finding was consistent with the result that Bioperfectus NAAT had a higher LOD than the three other kinds of NAATs. The four above mentioned reagents presented high specificity; however, for the detection of the samples with low virus concentration, Bioperfectus reagent had the risk of missing detection. Therefore, the LOD should be considered in the selection of SARS-CoV-2 NAATs.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yujuan Xiong","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou  University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhen-Zhen Li","author_inst":"Second Clinical Medical College, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine,"},{"author_name":"Qizhen Zhuang","author_inst":"Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yan Chao","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou  University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Molecular Diagnostic Engineering Technology Research Center"},{"author_name":"Yi-Yuan Ge","author_inst":"Guangdong Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Molecular Diagnostic Engineering Technology Research Center"},{"author_name":"Yi Wang","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou  University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pei-Feng Ke","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou  University of Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Research  on Emergency in TCM"},{"author_name":"Xianzhang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.005702","rel_title":"Knowledge synthesis from 100 million biomedical documents augments the deep expression profiling of coronavirus receptors","rel_date":"2020-03-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.005702","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic demands assimilation of all available biomedical knowledge to decode its mechanisms of pathogenicity and transmission. Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely underappreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to type II pneumocytes and olfactory epithelial cells. We further identify mature small intestinal enterocytes as a possible hotspot of COVID-19 fecal-oral transmission, where an intriguing maturation-correlated transcriptional signature is shared between ACE2 and the other coronavirus receptors DPP4 (MERS-CoV) and ANPEP (-coronavirus).

Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease varies in different countries. This variation is attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here, we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by different national policies with respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection from other respiratory infections besides tuberculosis. We compared BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19 for middle-high and high-income countries. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, the Netherlands, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. The difference cannot be accounted for by differences in disease onset, adoption of early social distancing policies, state of health services, nor income level. Reduced mortality suggests BCG vaccination could be a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aaron Miller","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mac Josh Reandelar","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College os Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Fasciglione","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Violeta Roumenova","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo H Otazu","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ramakrishna Chilaka","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Dariusz K Murakowski","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Kristopher Standish","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Bharathwaj Raghunathan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Enrique Garcia-Rivera","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Hugo Solomon","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Garg","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Barve","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Anuli Anyanwu-Ofili","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.009233","rel_title":"Design of potent membrane fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, an emerging coronavirus with high fusogenic activity","rel_date":"2020-03-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.009233","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by emerging SARS-CoV-2, has posed serious threats to global public health, economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this study, we firstly verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased -helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the presented results have provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuanmei Zhu","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danwei Yu","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongxia Yan","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huihui Chong","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuxian He","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo H Otazu","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ramakrishna Chilaka","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Dariusz K Murakowski","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Kristopher Standish","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Bharathwaj Raghunathan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Enrique Garcia-Rivera","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Hugo Solomon","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Garg","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Barve","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Anuli Anyanwu-Ofili","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.008904","rel_title":"Modeling of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Proteins by Machine Learning and Physics-Based Refinement","rel_date":"2020-03-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.008904","rel_abs":"Protein structures are crucial for understanding their biological activities. Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need to understand the biological behavior of the virus and provide a basis for developing effective therapies. Since the proteome of the virus was determined, some of the protein structures could be determined experimentally, and others were predicted via template-based modeling approaches. However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures. Previous efforts to predict structures for these proteins include efforts by DeepMind and the Zhang group via machine learning-based structure prediction methods, i.e. AlphaFold and C-I-TASSER. However, the predicted models vary greatly and have not yet been subjected to refinement. Here, we are reporting new predictions from our in-house structure prediction pipeline. The pipeline takes advantage of inter-residue contact predictions from trRosetta, a machine learning-based method. The predicted models were further improved by applying molecular dynamics simulation-based refinement. We also took the AlphaFold models and refined them by applying the same refinement method. Models based on our structure prediction pipeline and the refined AlphaFold models were analyzed and compared with the C-I-TASSER models.

The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, but also in the design of accurate diagnostics.\n\nWe analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher-frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host but also strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A \/ poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene.\n\nOur results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements, reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timokratis Karamitros","author_inst":"Unit of Bioinformatics and Applied Genomics, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Gethsimani Papadopoulou","author_inst":"Unit of Bioinformatics and Applied Genomics, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Maria Bousali","author_inst":"Unit of Bioinformatics and Applied Genomics, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Anastasios Mexias","author_inst":"Unit of Bioinformatics and Applied Genomics, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sotiris Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Academic Department of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Athens, Greece."},{"author_name":"Andreas Mentis","author_inst":"Public Health Laboratories, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Ramakrishna Chilaka","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Dariusz K Murakowski","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Kristopher Standish","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Bharathwaj Raghunathan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Enrique Garcia-Rivera","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Hugo Solomon","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Garg","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Barve","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Anuli Anyanwu-Ofili","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.012013","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 and ORF3a: Non-Synonymous Mutations and Polyproline Regions","rel_date":"2020-03-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.012013","rel_abs":"The effect of the rapid accumulation of non-synonymous mutations on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known. To predict the impact of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions identified in ORF3a on the formation of B-cell epitopes and their role in evading the immune response, nucleotide and protein sequences of 537 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions. Mutations were correlated with changes in epitope formation. A total of 19 different non-synonymous amino acids substitutions were detected in ORF3a among 537 SARS-CoV-2 strains. G251V was the most common and identified in 9.9% (n=53) of the strains and was predicted to lead to the loss of a B-cell like epitope in ORF3a. Polyproline regions were detected in two strains (EPI_ISL_410486, France and EPI_ISL_407079, Finland) and affected epitopes formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations and detected polyproline regions in ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 could be driving the evasion of the host immune response thus favoring viral spread.

Understanding the humoral antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins may help identify biomarkers that can be used to detect and treat COVID-19 infection. However, no immuno-proteomics platform exists that can perform such proteome-wide analysis. To address this need, we created a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptides 15 amino acids long with 5-amino acid offsets representing full-length SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Moreover, the array processing time is short (1.5 hours), the dynamic range is ~2 orders of magnitude, and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg\/mL. Here, the SARS-CoV-2 proteome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for SARS-CoV-1 proteins can also target SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These readily available reagents could be used immediately in COVID-19 research. Second, IgM and IgG immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were profiled in the serum of ten COVID-19 patients. Such epitope biomarkers provide insight into the immune response to COVID-19 and are potential targets for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine development. Finally, serological antibodies that may neutralize viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor were identified.

Specific antiviral drug are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 infections. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key CoV enzyme that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, which makes it an attractive drug target. In an effort to rapidly discover lead compounds targeting Mpro, two compounds (11a and 11b) were designed and synthesized, both of which exhibited excellent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.05 M and 0.04 M respectively. Significantly, both compounds exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in a cell-based assay with an EC50 value of 0.42 M and 0.33 M, respectively. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11a and 11b were determined at 1.5 [A] resolution, respectively. The crystal structures showed that 11a and 11b are covalent inhibitors, the aldehyde groups of which are bound covalently to Cys145 of Mpro. Both compounds showed good PK properties in vivo, and 11a also exhibited low toxicity which is promising drug leads with clinical potential that merits further studies.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenhao Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bing Zhang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xia-Ming Jiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haixia Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yao Zhao","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xiong Xie","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhenming Jin","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Peng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fengjiang Liu","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Chunpu Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"You Li","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Haofeng Wang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xi Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Cen","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Shulei Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Material Medica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.010694","rel_title":"The Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Abolished Pluripotency in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","rel_date":"2020-03-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.010694","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is raging across the world, leading to a global mortality rate of 3.4% (estimated by World Health Organization in March 2020). As a potential vaccine and therapeutic target, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoVN) functions in packaging the viral genome and viral self-assembly. To investigate the biological effects of nCoVN to human stem cells, genetically engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) expressing nCoVN (iPSC-nCoVN) were generated by lentiviral expression systems, in which the expression of nCoVN could be induced by the doxycycline. The proliferation rate of iPSC-nCoVN was decreased. Unexpectedly, the morphology of iPSC started to change after nCoVN expression for 7 days. The pluripotency marker TRA-1-81 were not detectable in iPSC-nCoVN after a four-day induction. Meanwhile, iPSC-nCoVN lost the ability for differentiation into cardiomyocytes with a routine differentiation protocol. The RNA-seq data of iPSC-nCoVN (induction for 30 days) and immunofluorescence assays illustrated that iPSC-nCoVN were turning to fibroblast-like cells. Our data suggested that nCoVN disrupted the pluripotent properties of iPSC and turned them into other types of cells, which provided a new insight to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zebin Lin","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiming Wu","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicin"},{"author_name":"Jinlian Mai","author_inst":"Guangdong Beating Origin Regenerative Medicine Co.

A recent study investigated translatome and proteome host cell changes induced in vitro by SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we use the publicly available proteomics data from this study to re-analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis. Proteins linked to inflammatory response, but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis, were found to be regulated. The up-regulation of the inflammatory-related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reaction and lung injury that is observed in advanced stages of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ignacio Ortea","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigacion e Innovacion Biomedica de Cadiz (INiBICA)"},{"author_name":"Jens-Ole Bock","author_inst":"Cobo Technologies Aps"},{"author_name":"Jinlian Mai","author_inst":"Guangdong Beating Origin Regenerative Medicine Co.

Using sequence alignments spanning a range of betacoronaviruses, we rank genomic regions by RNA sequence conservation, identifying 79 regions of length at least 15 nucleotides as exactly conserved over SARS-related complete genome sequences available near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. We then confirm the conservation of the majority of these genome regions across 739 SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported to date from the current COVID-19 outbreak, and we present a curated list of 30  SARS-related-conserved regions. We find that known RNA structured elements curated as Rfam families and in prior literature are enriched in these conserved genome regions, and we predict additional conserved, stable secondary structures across the viral genome. We provide 106  SARS-CoV-2-conserved-structured regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA. We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the 5 UTR, frame-shifting element, and 3 UTR. Last, we predict regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome have low propensity for RNA secondary structure and are conserved within SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted in which the patient selected COVID-19-related symptoms and report the time of onset and duration of symptoms. Results: A total of 212 adults were enrolled in this study, of which 127 (59.9%) were females, mean age was 48.50 (range: 17-79) years, and mean disease course was 26.78 (3-60) days. Fever and cough were the most common and earliest clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Diarrhoea occurred in 43.8% (93\/212) of patients, of which 86.0% (80\/93) had mushy stools. Nausea and vomiting were also common (20.7%). Diarrhoea lasted for 4.00(2.00-8.85) days and mostly occurred 5.00(0.25-11.00) days after the emergence of the first symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that diarrhoea was significantly correlated with fatigue [OR2.900,95%CI (1.629-5.164), p<0.0001].

We estimated population-level mortality rates by fitting a negative binomial regression model with the number of deaths as the outcome and population by age as an offset. We then calculated the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) based on the current COVID-19 figures and for alternative scenarios of increased prevalence. Findings: The COVID-19 population-level mortality rate (per 100,000 person-years) increased with age: from 0.1 deaths among 30-39 year olds to 9.5 deaths among [&ge;]80 year olds. The ASDR (per 100,000 person-years) was 0.8 deaths. The ASDR would increase to 52.0 deaths at a 1% prevalence (becoming the third leading cause of death) and 155.9 deaths at 3% prevalence (becoming the leading cause of death). Interpretation: Currently, the population-level mortality burden of COVID-19 in South Korea, as measured by the ASDR, was relatively low compared to other causes of death partly due to the low prevalence of COVID-19. If the prevalence increases from another outbreak, the mortality burden could increase substantially and surpass other leading causes.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samir Soneji","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Hiram Beltr\u00e1n-S\u00e1nchez","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"JaeWon Yang","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Mann","author_inst":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Grace Jin","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Laurie Yousman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alison Mosier-Mills","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Najem","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wiznia","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fengjiang Liu","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Chunpu Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"You Li","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Haofeng Wang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xi Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Cen","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Shulei Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Material Medica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041673","rel_title":"Radiographic Findings and other Predictors in Adults with Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041673","rel_abs":"As of March 20, 2020, there were 234,073 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and 9,840 deaths worldwide. Older age and elevated d-dimer are reported risk factors for Covid-19. However, whether early radiographic change is a predictor of fatality remains unknown. We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. A total of 128 patients were admitted. 102 patients were confirmed to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using RNA detection. As of March 20, 82 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 5 remained hospitalized. The median age was 57 years (range, 27 - 85), 59 (58%) were male, and 44 (43%) patients had a comorbidity. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. When compared with survivors, non-survivors were older and more likely to have lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated d-dimer, and increased hypersensitive troponin I. In a multivariate regression model that included these predictors, older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality. Twenty-one survivors and 11 non-survivors had CT scans within the first week. We used severity score to quantify the extent of lung opacification as described in the Supplementary Appendix. The total severity score and number of involved lung lobes within the first week were significantly greater in non-survivors compared to survivors . Using univariate logistic regression analysis, higher total severity score ([&ge;]15) (odds ratio 53, 95% CI 3-369; p = 0.003), and more involved lung lobes (5 involved lobes) (9, 2-53; p = 0.016) in CT images within the first week were significantly associated with fatality. Moreover, in this subset of patients with CT data within the first week, higher total severity score was the only independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporated the predictors discussed above (older age, lymphocytopenia, elevated LDH, elevated d-dimer, and increased troponin I). For survivors with serial CT scans performed over four weeks, total severity score peaked in the second week. This report suggests that the extent of lung lesions in early CT images is a potential predictor of poor outcome of Covid-19. This will help clinicians to identify the patients with poor prognosis at early stage.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaiyan Li","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dian Chen","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shengchong Chen","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuchen Feng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chenli Chang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zi Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Nan Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Guohua Zhen","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong Universtiy of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wiznia","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fengjiang Liu","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Chunpu Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"You Li","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Haofeng Wang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xi Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Cen","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Shulei Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Material Medica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041061","rel_title":"Clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041061","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND There is little information about the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19. METHODS In this retrospective analysis from five hospitals, we included pregnant women with Covid-19 from January 1 to February 20, 2020. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women and newborns. RESULTS Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. The rate of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.6%. CONCLUSIONS This report suggests that pregnant women are not at increased risk for severe illness or mortality with Covid-19 compared with the general population. The SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy might not be associated with as adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes that are seen with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection during pregnancy.

In this study we built a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. we will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases deaths and recovered for the whole country. Method: In this study we have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time seires from weighted averages of past daily values of the series. This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree more recent values are given a greater weight. The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season. Trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time. Results: If no control measures are put in place it is expected that over 40000 would be infected in Tehran around the middle of June. However if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success one would expect the spread of the COV19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend dropping off by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario that no further measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID19 to continue on a gentle incline reaching 21000 by mid-June. The same process has been applied to review the confirmed deaths and recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the Iranian New Years celebration Farvardin first month of Spring (30th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event. The best predictive model predicts the confirmed cases to be in the range of 35000 70000 with the number of reported COVDI-19 deaths to be between 3000 5000 and 5000 30000 of recovered cases. Conclusions: Modeling outbreak ofCovid19 shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be Haves this one. This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person. Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing. In addition many factors are effective in stopping the disease. These include citizens participation in the prevention process health education the effectiveness of instructive traditions environmental conditions and so on.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maryam Moghadami","author_inst":"Tehran university"},{"author_name":"Maryam Moghadami","author_inst":"Tehran University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Hassanzadeh","author_inst":"Tarbiat Modare University"},{"author_name":"ka wa","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Aziz Hedayati","author_inst":"Shahid Madani Azarbayjan University"},{"author_name":"Mila Malekolkalami","author_inst":"Tarbiat Modares University"},{"author_name":"Mei Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Jinmen Second People's Hospital, Jinmen, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng-cheng Liu","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Yichang Central People's Hospital, The First College of Clinical Medical, Three Gorges University, Yichang, Hubei, Chin"},{"author_name":"Wan-jiang Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Jian-li Wu","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Kutluk Oktay","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Ling Feng","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Jin","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Haofeng Wang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xi Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Cen","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Shulei Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Material Medica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20041087","rel_title":"Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor sterilization of N95 respirators for reuse","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20041087","rel_abs":"Abstract Reprocessing of used N95 respirators may ameliorate supply chain constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative. The FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative previously funded a study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators using a Clarus C system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) which normally is used to fumigate hospital rooms. The process preserved respirator function, but it is unknown if HP vapor would be virucidal since respirators have porous fabric that may harbor virus. We evaluated the virucidal activity of HP vapor using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) after inoculating 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) with 3 aerosolized bacteriophage that are a reasonable proxy for SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation resulted in contamination of the respirator with 9.87e4 plaque forming units (PFU) of phage phi-6, 4.17e7 PFU of phage T7 and 1.35e7 PFU of phage T1. Respirators were reprocessed with BQ-50 with a long aeration phase to reduce HP vapors. Virucidal activity was measured by a standard plaquing assay prior to and after sterilization. A single HP vapor cycle resulted in complete eradication of phage from masks (limit of detection 10 PFU, lower than the infectious dose of the majority of respiratory viral pathogens). After 5 cycles, the respirators appeared similar to new with no deformity. Use of a Bioquell machine can be scaled to permit simultaneous sterilization of a large number of used but otherwise intact respirators. HP vapor reprocessing may ease shortages and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative to non-NIOSH masks.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Kenney","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Benjamin K Chan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Kortright","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Margaret Cintron","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Nancy Havill","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Mark Russi","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jaqueline Epright","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Lorraine Lee","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Thomas Balcezak","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health System"},{"author_name":"Richard Martinello","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Kutluk Oktay","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Ling Feng","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Jin","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Haofeng Wang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xi Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Cen","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Shulei Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Material Medica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20040998","rel_title":"A demographic adjustment to improve measurement of COVID-19 severity at the developing stage of the pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20040998","rel_abs":"The need for accurate statistics has never been felt so deeply as the novel COVID-19 pathogen spreads around the world and quantifying its severity is a primary clinical and public health issue. In Italy, the magnitude and increasing trend of the case-fatality risk (CFR) is fueling the already high levels of public alarm. In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age. When applied to publicly released data for Italy, we show that until March 16 our adjusted CFR was similar to that of Wuhan, the most affected Chinese region, where COVID-19 has now been contained. This indicates that our adjusted CFR improves its comparability over time, making an important tool to chart the course of the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. Since March 16, the Italian COVID-19 outbreak has entered a new phase, with the northern and southern regions following different trajectories. As a result, our adjusted CFR has been increasing between March 16 and March 20.

Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 24th March 2020. Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full text. Data extraction Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and prediction model performance. Results 2696 titles were screened. Of these, 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included for data extraction and critical appraisal. We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models to detect COVID-19 infection in symptomatic individuals (13 of which were machine learning utilising computed tomography (CT) results); and ten prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to a severe state, or length of hospital stay. Only one of these studies used data on COVID-19 cases outside of China. Most reported predictors of presence of COVID-19 in suspected patients included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. Most reported predictors of severe prognosis in infected patients included age, sex, features derived from CT, C-reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. Estimated C-index estimates for the prediction models ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in those for the general population (reported for all 3 general population models), from 0.81 to > 0.99 in those for diagnosis (reported for 13 of the 18 diagnostic models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in those for prognosis (reported for 6 of the 10 prognostic models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and poor statistical analysis, including high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. A description of the study population and intended use of the models was absent in almost all reports, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion COVID-19 related prediction models are quickly entering the academic literature, to support medical decision making at a time where this is urgently needed. Our review indicates proposed models are poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Thus, their reported performance is likely optimistic and using them to support medical decision making is not advised. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed prediction models and validating (evaluating) existing models. The aforementioned predictors identified in multiple included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. We also stress the need to follow methodological guidance when developing and validating prediction models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD statement to facilitate validating, appraising, advocating and clinically using the reported models.

Although SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients, their dynamics and association with outcomes have not been characterized. Methods: A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins tested in Tongji hospital were retrospectively investigated. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and outcomes data were compared between mild-moderate group and died group. Further, a paired case-control study was conducted where each deceased case was matched to three mild-moderate patients of similar age. Findings: Among 116 subjects included, 101 mild-moderate patients survived and 15 cases died. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, while serum IgG levels increased over 8 weeks. Serum IgM levels were higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.024), but not IgG. Serum IgM levels were negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and albumin levels (r = -0.269, P = 0.003; r = -0.188, P = 0.043; and r = -0.198, P = 0.033, resp.). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for IgM antibody was 0.681 (95% CI: 0.517-0.845, P = 0.024). In case-control study paired by age, serum IgM was higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.019), positively correlated with leucocyte count (r = 0.260, P = 0.045), while negatively correlated with clinical outcome and albumin levels (r = -0.337, P = 0.008; r = -0.265, P = 0.041). AUC for IgM levels was 0.704 (95% CI: 0.534-0.873, P = 0.019). Interpretation: These results indicate that dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies was similar with that of SARS-CoV, while elevated serum IgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhihua Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huijun Li","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Li","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chunguang Yang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Guo","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhiquan Hu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Chen","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shaogang Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Richard D Riley","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ewoud Schuit","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Luc Smits","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Kym IE Snell","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ewout W Steyerberg","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Christine Wallisch","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Maarten van Smeden","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Shulei Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Material Medica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041244","rel_title":"Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041244","rel_abs":"Following the outbreak of novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 in Wuhan, China late 2019, different countries have put in place interventions such as travel ban, proper hygiene, and social distancing to slow the spread of this novel virus.

However, studies about risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the potential impact of Lopinavir\/Ritonavir (LPV\/r) treatment remain scarce. Methods: In this retrospective study, data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had RT-PCR conversion at the NO.3 People's hospital of Hubei province between 31 January and 09 March 2020. We compared clinical features and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients with LPV\/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. Results: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV\/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18-32 days). Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and lack of LPV\/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The median duration of viral shedding was shorter in the LPV\/r treatment group (n=78) than that in no LPV\/r treatment group (n=42) (median, 22 days vs. 28.5 days, p=0.02). Only earlier administration of LPV\/r treatment ([&le;]10 days from symptom onset) could shorten the duration of viral shedding. Conclusions: Older age and lack of LPV\/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19. Earlier administration of LPV\/r treatment could shorten viral shedding.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Yan","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People Hospital of Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao-yan Liu","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People Hospital of Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Ya-nan Zhu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"},{"author_name":"Li Huang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"},{"author_name":"Bi-tang Dan","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People Hospital of Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Guo-jun Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"},{"author_name":"Yong-hua Gao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"},{"author_name":"Shaogang Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Richard D Riley","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ewoud Schuit","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Luc Smits","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Kym IE Snell","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ewout W Steyerberg","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Christine Wallisch","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Maarten van Smeden","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Shulei Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Material Medica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041970","rel_title":"Haplotype networks of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041970","rel_abs":"The Diamond Princess (DP) cruise ship was put under quarantine offshore Yokohama, Japan, after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was confirmed as a COVID-19 case.
