It is therefore important and timely to characterize interactions between the virus and host cell at the molecular level to understand its disease pathogenesis. To gain insights, we performed high-throughput sequencing that generated time-series data simultaneously for bioinformatics analysis of virus genomes and host transcriptomes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our analysis results showed that the rapid growth of the virus was accompanied by an early intensive response of host genes. We also systematically compared the molecular footprints of the host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 induced hundreds of up-regulated host genes hallmarked by a significant cytokine production followed by virus-specific host antiviral responses. While the cytokine and antiviral responses triggered by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were only observed during the late stage of infection, the host antiviral responses during the SARS-CoV-2 infection were gradually enhanced lagging behind the production of cytokine. The early rapid host responses were potentially attributed to the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, underscored by evidence of a remarkably up-regulated gene expression of TPRMSS2 soon after infection. Taken together, our findings provide novel molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiya Sun","author_inst":"Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College; Suzhou Institute of System"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Virology, National Health and Family Planning Commission, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Aiping Wu","author_inst":"Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ren Yang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Virology, National Health and Family Planning Commission, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Mei Pan","author_inst":"Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College; Suzhou Institute of System"},{"author_name":"Jie Sheng","author_inst":"Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College; Suzhou Institute of System"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College; Suzhou Institute of System"},{"author_name":"Longfei Mao","author_inst":"Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College; Suzhou Institute of System"},{"author_name":"Ming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Beijing TongRen Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Baoying Huang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Virology, National Health and Family Planning Commission, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Virology, National Health and Family Planning Commission, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.071290","rel_title":"Potent antiviral effect of protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin on SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.071290","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading rapidly worldwide.

The selectivity indices of PpIX and verteporfin were 952.74 and 368.93, respectively, suggesting broad margin of safety. Importantly, PpIX and verteporfin prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice adenovirally transduced with human ACE2. The compounds, sharing a porphyrin ring structure, were shown to bind viral receptor ACE2 and interfere with the interaction between ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain of viral S protein. Our study suggests that PpIX and verteporfin are potent antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection and sheds new light on developing novel chemoprophylaxis and chemotherapy against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chenjian Gu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Huimin Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Yuanfei Zhu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhou","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology & Immunology, Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Sha"},{"author_name":"Zhiping Sun","author_inst":"BSL-3 laboratory of Fudan University, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"BSL-3 laboratory of Fudan University, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Jing Liu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Zhong Huang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.069039","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 genomes recovered by long amplicon tiling multiplex approach using nanopore sequencing and applicable to other sequencing platforms","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.069039","rel_abs":"Genomic surveillance has become a useful tool for better understanding virus pathogenicity, origin and spread.

We characterized the abilities to induce and to response to IFN{beta}\/IFN{lambda}1 of two or our clinical isolates, SARS-CoV-2\/NTU01\/TWN\/human\/2020 and SARS-CoV-2\/NTU02\/TWN\/human\/2020, which exhibit only two amino acid differences over the [~]30kb viral genome. We found that both isolates may infect Huh7, A549 and Calu-3 cells, yet the RIG-I-like receptor-dependent antiviral signaling was poorly induced in these cells in the early infections. Unexpectedly, we found that the intracellular vRNA levels of these isolates were sustained upon to type I\/III IFN treatments, and this phenotype was more pronounced in the Taiwan\/NTU01\/2020 isolate. The type I\/III IFN responses are antiviral but partially proviral in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Poor induction and response to innate immunity may contribute to destitute neutralization index of the antibody produced, and indeed we found that the patient serum could not efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virions. With better understandings of the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host antiviral innate immunity, our report may provide new insights for the regimen of therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fu Hsin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Tai-Ling Chao","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Yun-Rui Chan","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Han-Chieh Kao","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Wang-Da Liu","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jann-Tay Wang","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu-Hao Pang","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Chih-Hui Lin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Ya-Min Tsai","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yi Lin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Sui-Yuan Chang","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Helene Minyi Liu","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Andre Abreu","author_inst":"National Coordination of Laboratories, Brazilian Ministry of Health, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Rachel Williams","author_inst":"Pathogen Genomic Unit, University College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Judith Breuer","author_inst":"University College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Marilda M Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratory of Respiratory Viruses and Measles, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.072728","rel_title":"SARS-CoV2 quantification using RT-dPCR: a faster and safer alternative to assist viral genomic copies assessment using RT-qPCR","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.072728","rel_abs":"In this study, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV 2 RNA extract were tested using RT-dPCR using three different primer-probe assays aiming SARS-CoV 2 nucleocapsid coding region.

To enter host cells, the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to its receptor, ACE2, and is then processed by TMPRSS2. Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species, relative to human ACE2, and correlated these changes with COVID-19 infection data. We also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity. We predict that mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but few fish, birds or reptiles. Susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus, necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Su Datt Lam","author_inst":"Department of Applied Physics, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, 43600, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Bordin","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vaishali P Waman","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Harry M Scholes","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Ashford","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Neeladri Sen","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, 411008, India"},{"author_name":"Lucy van Dorp","author_inst":"UCL Genetics Institute"},{"author_name":"Clemens Rauer","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Natalie L Dawson","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Camilla SM Pang","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Mahnaz Abbasian","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian Sillitoe","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah JL Edwards","author_inst":"Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Jonathan G Lees","author_inst":"Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, OX3 OBP, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne M Santini","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Christine A Orengo","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.067769","rel_title":"Heat inactivation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.067769","rel_abs":"Supernatants of cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, nasopharyngeal and sera samples containing SARS-CoV-2 were submitted to heat inactivation for various periods of time, ranging from 30 seconds to 60 minutes.

Pakistani strain MT240479 (Gilgit1-Pak) was found in close proximity to MT184913 (CruiseA-USA), while the second Pakistani strain MT262993 (Manga-Pak) was neighboring to MT039887 (WI-USA) strain in the constructed cladogram in this article. Afterward, four whole genome SARS-nCoV2 strain sequences were taken for variant calling analysis, those who appeared nearest relative in the earlier cladogram constructed a week time ago. Among those two Pakistani strains each of 29,836 bases were compared against MT263429 from (WI-USA) of 29,889 bases and MT259229 (Wuhan-China) of 29,864 bases. We identified 31 variants in both Pakistani strains, (Manga-Pak vs USA=2del+7SNPs, Manga-Pak vs Chinese=2del+2SNPs, Gilgit1-Pak vs USA=10SNPs, Gilgit1-Pak vs Chinese=8SNPs), which caused alteration in ORF1ab, ORF1a and N genes with having functions of viral replication and translation, host innate immunity and viral capsid formation respectively. These novel variants are assumed to be liable for low mortality rate in Pakistan with 385 as compared to USA with 63,871 and China with 4,633 deaths by May 01, 2020. However functional effects of these variants need further confirmatory studies. Moreover, mutated N & ORF1a proteins in Pakistani strains were also analyzed by 3D structure modelling, which give another dimension of comparing these alterations at amino acid level. In a nutshell, these novel variants are assumed to be linked with reduced mortality of COVID-19 in Pakistan along with other influencing factors, these novel variants would also be useful to understand the virulence of this virus and to develop indigenous vaccines and therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rashid Saif","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Educational Complex, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Tania Mahmood","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Educational Complex, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Aniqa Ejaz","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Educational Complex, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Saeeda Zia","author_inst":"National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Abdul Rasheed Qureshi","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Chest Hospital, Ferozpure Road, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Siddhartha Sankar Jana","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, West Bengal, 700032, India."},{"author_name":"Lucy van Dorp","author_inst":"UCL Genetics Institute"},{"author_name":"Clemens Rauer","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Natalie L Dawson","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Camilla SM Pang","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Mahnaz Abbasian","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian Sillitoe","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah JL Edwards","author_inst":"Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Jonathan G Lees","author_inst":"Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, OX3 OBP, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne M Santini","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Christine A Orengo","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.072330","rel_title":"Rampant C->U hypermutation in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses - causes and consequences for their short and long evolutionary trajectories","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.072330","rel_abs":"The pandemic of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has motivated an intensive analysis of its molecular epidemiology following its worldwide spread. To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a dataset of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants showed a mean 5.5-9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, commensurate with a mid-range coronavirus substitution rate of 3x10-4 substitutions\/site\/year. Almost half of sequence changes were C->U transitions with an 8-fold base frequency normalised directional asymmetry between C->U and U->C substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and to a decreasing degree in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. C->U transitions underpinned almost half of the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants, and occurred preferentially in both 5U\/A and 3U\/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favoured motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins. Marked base asymmetries observed in non-pandemic human coronaviruses (U>>A>G>>C) and low G+C contents may represent long term effects of prolonged C->U hypermutation in their hosts.\n\nImportanceThe evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short and long term evolution. Repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favoured mutational hotspots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus represents a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and Darwinian evolutionary frameworks that are typically used in molecular epidemiology investigations.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3SY, UK."},{"author_name":"Tania Mahmood","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Educational Complex, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Aniqa Ejaz","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Educational Complex, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Saeeda Zia","author_inst":"National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Abdul Rasheed Qureshi","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Chest Hospital, Ferozpure Road, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Siddhartha Sankar Jana","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, West Bengal, 700032, India."},{"author_name":"Lucy van Dorp","author_inst":"UCL Genetics Institute"},{"author_name":"Clemens Rauer","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Natalie L Dawson","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Camilla SM Pang","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Mahnaz Abbasian","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian Sillitoe","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah JL Edwards","author_inst":"Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Jonathan G Lees","author_inst":"Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, OX3 OBP, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne M Santini","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Christine A Orengo","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083055","rel_title":"A comparison of health care worker-collected foam and polyester nasal swabs in convalescent COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083055","rel_abs":"Background: The exponential growth of COVID-19 cases and testing has created supply shortages at various points in the testing workflow. As of April 15, 2020 FDA recommendations only allowed for the use of nasopharyngeal, flocked mid turbinate, or foam nasal swabs, all of which are in very low supply. Polyester swabs are more readily available and mass producible. We compare the performance of polyester and foam swabs stored in different transport media. Methods: Both polyester and foam nasal swabs were collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients at a single visit. Using the foam nasal swabs as the comparator, sensitivity of the polyester swabs in each media were calculated, three by three tables were constructed to measure concordance, and cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared. Findings: 126 visits had polyester and foam swabs stored in viral transport media (VTM), 51 had polyester and foam swabs stored in saline, and 63 had a foam swab in VTM and a polyester swab stored in a dry tube. Using nasal foam swabs as a comparator, polyester nasal swabs had a sensitivity of 86*5% when both samples were stored in VTM, 86*7% when both samples were stored in saline, and 72*4% when the polyester swab was stored dry and the foam swab was stored in VTM. Polyester and foam Ct values from the same visit were correlated, but polyester swabs showed decreased performance for cases with a viral load near the detection threshold and higher Ct values on average. Interpretation: Polyester nasal swabs showed a reduction in performance from foam nasal swabs, but may still provide a viable sample collection method given the current supply shortages and public health emergency.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian Hart","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Po Tu","author_inst":"The Everett Clinic"},{"author_name":"Rachel Jennings","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Prateek Verma","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Leah Padgett","author_inst":"Quantigen Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Douglas Rains","author_inst":"Quantigen Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Ethan Berke","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Natalie L Dawson","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Camilla SM Pang","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Mahnaz Abbasian","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian Sillitoe","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah JL Edwards","author_inst":"Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Jonathan G Lees","author_inst":"Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, OX3 OBP, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne M Santini","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Christine A Orengo","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20082917","rel_title":"Tuberculosis and COVID-19 in 2020: lessons from the past viral outbreaks and possible future outcomes","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20082917","rel_abs":"Background. The threat of contagious infectious diseases is constantly evolving, as demographic explosion, travel globalization and changes in human lifestyle increase the risk of spreading pathogens, leading to accelerated changes in disease landscape. Of particular interest is the aftermath of superimposing viral epidemics (especially SARS-CoV-2) over long-standing diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), which remains a significant disease for public health worldwide and especially in emerging economies. Methods and Results. PubMed electronic database was requested for relevant articles linking TB, influenza and SARS-CoV viruses and subsequently assessed eligibility according to inclusion criteria. Using a data mining approach, we also queried the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We aimed to answer the following questions: What can be learned from other coronavirus outbreaks (with a focus on TB patients)? Is coinfection (TB and SARS-CoV-2) more severe? Is there a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2? How does the TB vaccine affect COVID-19? How does one diagnosis affect the other? Discussions. Few essential elements about TB and SARS-CoV coinfections were discussed. First, lessons from the past outbreaks (other coronaviruses), as well as influenza pandemic \/ seasonal outbreaks have taught the importance of infection control to avoid the severe impact on TB patients. Second, although challenging due to data scarcity, investigating the pathological pathways linking TB and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the idea that their coexistence might yield a more severe clinical evolution. Finally, we addressed the issues of vaccination and diagnostic reliability in the context of coinfection. Conclusions. Because viral respiratory infections and TB impede the host's immune responses, it can be assumed that their harmful synergism may contribute to more severe clinical evolution. Despite the rapidly growing number of cases, the data needed to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with latent TB and TB sequelae still lies ahead.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Radu Crisan-Dabija","author_inst":"University of Medicine and Pharmacy \"Grigore T.

Post-mortem analyses revealed diffuse alveolar damage in both the acute and organizing phases, with a predominantly CD68+ inflammatory infiltrate.

A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and arXiv databases using the following search terms [\"artificial intelligence\" OR \"deep learning\" OR \"neural networks\"], AND [\"COVID-19\" OR \"SARS-CoV-2\"] AND [\"chest X-ray\" OR \"CXR\" OR \"X-ray\"] found 14 recent studies.

Firstly, weaknesses of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions were analyzed, tackling the issues with datasets (from both medical and technical points of view) and the vulnerability of used algorithms. Then, arguments were provided for why our study design is stronger and more realistic than the previously quoted papers, balancing the possible false expectations with facts. The authors consider that the potential of AI use in COVID-19 diagnosis on CXR is real. However, scientific community should be careful in interpreting statements, results and conclusions regarding AI use in imaging. It is therefore necessary to adopt standards for research and publication of data, because it seems that in the recent months scientific reality suffered manipulations and distortions. Also, a call for responsible approaches to the imaging methods in COVID-19 is raised. It seems mandatory to follow some rigorous approaches in order to provide with adequate results in daily routine.

Methods: In this retrospective single center study, we finally included 245 consecutive patients who confirmed COVID 19 in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital from January 1 to February 29. Cases were classified as either discharged or dead. Demographic, clinical and laboratory datas were registered, two different nutritional indices were calculated: (i)the Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score; (ii) prognostic nutritional index (PNI). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between nutritional indices and hospital death . Results: 212 of them were discharged and 33 of them died. In hospital mortality was signifcantly higher in the severe group of PNI than in the moderate and normal groups. It was also significantly worse in the severe CONUT group than in the moderate, mild , and normal CONUT groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the CONUT score (odds ratio3.371,95%CI (1.124 10.106), p = 0.030) and PNI(odds ratio 0.721,95% CI(0.581 0.896),P=0.003) were independent predictors of all cause death at an early stage; Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed that the severe group of PNI was the independent risk predictor of in hospital death(odds ratio 24.225, 95% CI(2.147 273.327), p=0.010).The CONUT score cutoff value was 5.5 (56.00 and 80.81%; AUC 0.753; 95% CI(0.644 0.862);respectively).The PNI cutoff value was 40.58 (81.80 and 66.20%; AUC 0.778; 95% CI(0.686 0.809); respectively).We use PNI and the COUNT score to assess malnutrition, which can have a prognosis effect of COVID 19 patients.

It is important to distinguish COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias in order to properly screen and diagnose patients, reduce nosocomial infections, and complement the inadequacy of nucleic acid testing. In this study, we retrospectively analysed the clinical data of COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 patients treated at our hospital between January 17 and February 27, 2020 in order to summarize our clinical experience in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 23 confirmed COVID-19 patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17 to February 27, 2020, while 29 confirmed non-COVID-19 patients were enrolled in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. We collected baseline data, epidemiological data, clinical characteristics, imaging findings, viral nucleic acid test results, and survival data. SPSS v22.0 was used for statistical analysis. Outcomes were followed up until March 25. Results: A total of 52 patients were included in this study, including 23 COVID-19 patients and 29 non-COVID-19 patients. No significant between-group difference was observed in age, sex, primary signs or symptoms, cellular immunity, or platelet count. Significant between-group differences were observed in clinical characteristics such as dry cough, contact with individuals from Wuhan, some underlying diseases, nucleated cell count, chest imaging findings, viral nucleic acid test result,28-day mortality, and 28-day survival. Conclusion: Epidemiological data, clinical symptoms, nucleic acid test results for COVID-19 and chest CT manifestation may help distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases, prevent imported cases and nosocomial infections.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao-jin Li","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bing-Xing Shuai","author_inst":"Medical Affairs Department, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Zhong-Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Li Peng","author_inst":"Department of General Practice, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenshun Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Harry H.X.

Drastic measures of social distancing are enforced in society and healthcare systems are being pushed to and over their limits. Objectives : To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 by applying AI to chest CT and evaluate validation performance. Methods : In this retrospective multi-site study, a fully automated AI framework was developed to extract radiomics features from volumetric chest CT exams to learn the detection pattern of COVID-19 patients. We analysed the data from 181 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients as well as 1200 other non-COVID-19 control patients to build and assess the performance of the model. The datasets were collected from 2 different hospital sites of the CHU Liege, Belgium. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Results : 1381 patients were included in this study. The average age was 64.4 and 63.8 years with a gender balance of 56% and 52% male in the COVID-19 and control group, respectively. The final curated dataset used for model construction and validation consisted of chest CT scans of 892 patients. The model sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the test set (training 80% and test 20% of patients) were 78.94% and 91.09%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.9398 (95% CI: 0.875-1). The negative predictive value of the algorithm was found to be larger than 97%. Conclusions : Benchmarked against RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19, our AI framework can accurately differentiate COVID-19 from routine clinical conditions in a fully automated fashion. Thus, providing rapid accurate diagnosis in patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, facilitating the timely implementation of isolation procedures and early intervention.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julien Guiot","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Akshayaa Vaidyanathan","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium, The D-Lab, Department of Precision Medicine, Department of Nuclear Medicine, GROW School for Oncology, Maastricht University, "},{"author_name":"Louis Deprez","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Fadila Zerka","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium, The D-Lab, Department of Precision Medicine, Department of Nuclear Medicine, GROW School for Oncology, Maastricht University, "},{"author_name":"Denis Danthine","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Anne-Noelle Frix","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Marie Thys","author_inst":"Department of Medico-Economic Information, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Monique Henket","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Gregory Canivet","author_inst":"Department of Computer Applications, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Stephane Mathieu","author_inst":"Department of Computer Applications, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Eva Eftaxia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lambin","author_inst":"The D-Lab, Department of Precision Medicine, Department of Nuclear Medicine, GROW School for Oncology, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Nathan Tsoutzidis","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Miraglio","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Sean Walsh","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Michel Moutschen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium Michel"},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20085910","rel_title":"Validation of an extraction-free RT-PCR protocol for detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20085910","rel_abs":"In light of supply chain failures for reagents and consumables needed for purification of nucleic acid for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR, we aim to verify the performance and utility of a non-extraction protocol for RT-PCR (\"direct RT-PCR\").

As our diagnostic laboratory was not equipped for reagent production, we took advantage of space and personnel that became available due to closure of the research division of our medical center. We utilized a formulation of VTM described by the CDC that was simple to produce, did not require filtration for sterilization, and used reagents that were available from commercial suppliers. Performance of VTM was evaluated by several quality assurance measures. Based on Ct values of spiking experiments, we found that our VTM supported highly consistent amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target (coefficient of variation = 2.95%) using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay on the Abbott m2000 platform. VTM was also found to be compatible with multiple swab types and, based on accelerated stability studies, able to maintain functionality for at least four months at room temperature. We further discuss how we met logistical challenges associated with large-scale VTM production in a crisis setting including use of staged, assembly line for VTM transport tube production.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth P Smith","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Annie Cheng","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amber Chopelas","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah DuBois-Coyne","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ikram Mezghani","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shade Rodriguez","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Talay","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"James E Kirby","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Canivet","author_inst":"Department of Computer Applications, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Stephane Mathieu","author_inst":"Department of Computer Applications, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Eva Eftaxia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lambin","author_inst":"The D-Lab, Department of Precision Medicine, Department of Nuclear Medicine, GROW School for Oncology, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Nathan Tsoutzidis","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Miraglio","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Sean Walsh","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Michel Moutschen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium Michel"},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20082552","rel_title":"Can Nebulised Heparin Reduce Time to Extubation in SARS CoV 2 The CHARTER Study Protocol","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20082552","rel_abs":"Introduction: COVID 19 is associated with the development of ARDS displaying the typical features of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive pulmonary coagulation activation resulting in fibrin deposition in the microvasculature and formation of hyaline membranes in the air sacs. The anticoagulant actions of nebulised heparin limit fibrin deposition and progression of lung injury. Serendipitously, unfractionated heparin also inactivates the SARS CoV 2 virus and prevents its entry into mammalian cells. Nebulisation of heparin may therefore limit both fibrin mediated lung injury and inhibit pulmonary infection by SARS CoV 2. For these reasons we have initiated a multicentre international trial of nebulised heparin in patients with COVID 19. Methods and intervention: Mechanically ventilated patients with confirmed or strongly suspected SARS CoV 2 infection, hypoxaemia and an acute pulmonary opacity in at least one lung quadrant on chest Xray, will be randomised to nebulised heparin 25,000 Units every 6 hours or standard care for up to 10 days while mechanically ventilated. The primary outcome is the time to separation from invasive ventilation to day 28, where non survivors to day 28 are treated as though not separated from invasive ventilation. Ethics and dissemination: The study protocol has been submitted to the human research and ethics committee of St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. Submission is pending in other jurisdictions.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is yielding a global outbreak with serious threats to public health. In this paper, we aimed to review the current knowledge about COVID-19 infectious risk status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients requiring immunosuppressive medication. Also, we focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear to not have higher risks of infection and worse outcome in COVID-19 than the general population, in attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care. Methods. PubMed electronic database was interogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Discussions. Few molecular and therapeutic interactions between IBD and pathogenic coronaviruses were explored. First, we showed how the activity of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, CD209L alternate receptor and phosphorylated  subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 might exert protective impact in IBD in case of coronavirus infection. Second, IBD medication was discussed in the context of possible beneficial effects on COVID-19 pathogeny including \"cytokine storm\" prevention and treatment, immunomodulation, interferon signaling blocking, viral endocytosis inhibition. Conclusions. Using current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses immunopathology, we showed why IBD patients should not be considered at an increased risk of infection or more severe outcomes. Whether our findings are entirely applicable to the pathogenesis, disease susceptibility and treatment management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD must be further explored.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Iolanda Valentina Popa","author_inst":"Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Iasi, Romania and 'Grigore T.

Nearly ten percent of reported coronavirus infections in Italy occurred in healthcare workers. This study aimed to understand physicians access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and to information about their use, risk perception and strategies adopted to prevent contracting the infection. Methods We undertook a cross-sectional, online self-reported survey implemented between March 31 and April 5 2020 of Italian physicians. Results Responses were received from 529 physicians, only 13% of which reported to have access to PPE every time they need them. Approximately half of the physicians reported that the information received about the use of PPE was either clear (47%) or complete (54%). Risk perception about contracting the infection was influenced by receiving adequate information on the use of PPE. Access to adequate information on the use of PPE was associated with better ability to perform donning and doffing procedures [OR=2.2 95% C.I. 1.7-2.8] and reduced perception of risk [OR=0.5, 95% C.I. 0.4-0.6]. Conclusions Results from this rapid survey indicate that while ramping up supplies on PPE for healthcare workers is certainly of mandatory importance, adequate training and clear instructions are just as important.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elena Savoia","author_inst":"Emergency Preparedness Research, Evaluation, & Practice (EPREP) program, Division of Policy Translation & Leadership Development, Harvard T.H.

In Europe, the pandemic started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020. It has subsequently spread over the continent, with special virulence in northern Italy and inland Spain. In this study we show that an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, in terms of air temperature and humidity, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that the strong atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated in these regions may have favored the virus's propagation, by short-range droplet transmission as well as likely by long-range aerosol (airborne) transmission.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arturo Sanchez-Lorenzo","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain"},{"author_name":"Javier Vaquero-Martinez","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain"},{"author_name":"Josep Calbo","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Girona, Girona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Martin Wild","author_inst":"Institute for Atmosphere and Climate (IAC), ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ana Santurtun","author_inst":"Unit of Legal Medicine, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"},{"author_name":"Joan-Albert Lopez-Bustins","author_inst":"Climatology Group, Department of Geography, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose-Manuel Vaquero","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain"},{"author_name":"Doris Folini","author_inst":"Institute for Atmosphere and Climate (IAC), ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Manuel Anton","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain"},{"author_name":"John Moran","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, South Australia."},{"author_name":"Frank Van Haren","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Canberra Hospital, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gordon Doig","author_inst":"Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sachin Gupta","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Angajendra Ghosh","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simone Said","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Santamaria","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20079244","rel_title":"Seroprevalence of COVID-19 virus infection in Guilan province, Iran","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20079244","rel_abs":"Background: The extent of infection by coronavirus disease 2019 has not been well documented. In this study we aimed to determine seropositivity of COVID-19 virus infection in population of a highly affected area in north of Iran. Methods: In a population-based cluster random sampling design through phone call invitation, a total of 196 household including 552 subjects agreed to participate in this study. Each participant were taken 50ml blood sample at health care center. Rapid test kits were used to detect antibody against COVID-19. Crude, population-weight adjusted and test performance adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 were reported. Results: The prevalence of antibody seropositivity was 0.22 (95%CI: 0.19-0.26). The population weight adjusted estimate was 0.21 (95%CI: 0.14-0.29) and test performance adjusted prevalence was 0.33 (95%CI: 0.28-0.39). Based on these estimates the range of infected people in this province would be between 518000 and 777000. Conclusion: The population seropositivity prevalence of COVID-19 virus infection indicated that the asymptomatic infection is much higher than the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. This estimate can be used to better detect infection fatality rate and decide for public policy guidelines.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maryam Shakiba","author_inst":"Guilan university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyed Saeed Hashemi Nazari","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Fardin Mehrabian","author_inst":"Guilan university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyed Mahmoud Rezvani","author_inst":"Guilan university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Zahra Ghasempour","author_inst":"Guilan university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Abtin Heidarzadeh","author_inst":"Guilan university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Jose-Manuel Vaquero","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain"},{"author_name":"Doris Folini","author_inst":"Institute for Atmosphere and Climate (IAC), ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Manuel Anton","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain"},{"author_name":"John Moran","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, South Australia."},{"author_name":"Frank Van Haren","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Canberra Hospital, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gordon Doig","author_inst":"Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sachin Gupta","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Angajendra Ghosh","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simone Said","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Santamaria","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078709","rel_title":"Extensive testing may reduce COVID-19 mortality: a lesson from northern Italy","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078709","rel_abs":"We examined data on the progression of COVID-19 epidemics in four regions in northern Italy.

Since we observed clinical and histopathological similarities between COVID-19 and lung manifestations of connective tissue disease (CTD-ILD) in our clinical practice, aim of the present study is to analyze a possible role of autoimmunity in SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure. Methods: In this prospective, single-center trial, we enrolled 22 consecutive patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized in March and April, 2020. We performed high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and full laboratory testing including autoantibody (AAB) screening (anti-ANA, SS-B\/La, Scl-70, Jo-1, CENP-B, PM-Scl). Transbronchial biopsies as well as post mortem tissue samples were obtained from 3 and 2 cases, respectively, and subsequent histopathologic analysis with special emphasis on characterization of interstitial lung disease was performed. Results: Twelve of 22 patients (54.5%) were male and median age was 69.0 (range: 28-88). 11 (50.0%) patients had to be undergo intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Intubation with ventilation was required in 10\/22 cases (46%). Median follow-up was 26 days. Clinical and serological parameters were comparable to previous reports. Radiological and histopathological findings were highly heterogeneous including patterns reminiscent of CTD-ILD. AAB titers [&ge;]1:100 were detected in 10\/11 (91.9%) COVID-19 patients who required ICU treatment, but in 4\/11 (36.4%) patients with mild clinical course (p=0.024). Patients with AABs tended to require invasive ventilation and showed significantly more severe complications (64.3% vs. 12.5%, p=0.031). Overall COVID-19-related mortality was 18.2% among hospitalized patients at our institution. Conclusion: Our findings point out serological, radiological and histomorphological similarities between COVID-19-associated ARDS and acute exacerbation of CTD-ILD. While the exact mechanism is still unknown, we postulate that SARS-CoV-2 infection might trigger or simulate a form of organ-specific autoimmunity in predisposed patients. The detection of autoantibodies might identify patients who profit from immunosuppressive therapy to prevent the development of respiratory failure.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Gagiannis","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Julie Steinestel","author_inst":"Clinic of Urology, University Hospital Augsburg"},{"author_name":"Carsten Hackenbroch","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Michael Hannemann","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Vincent G Umathum","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Niklas Gebauer","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Marcel Stahl","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Hanno M Witte","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Konrad Steinestel","author_inst":"Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"John Moran","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, South Australia."},{"author_name":"Frank Van Haren","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Canberra Hospital, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gordon Doig","author_inst":"Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sachin Gupta","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Angajendra Ghosh","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simone Said","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Santamaria","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20078329","rel_title":"Population-scale testing can suppress the spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20078329","rel_abs":"We propose an additional intervention that would contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, offer more protection for people working in essential jobs, and help guide an eventual reopening of society. The intervention is based on: (1) testing every individual (2) repeatedly, and (3) isolation of infected individuals. We show here that at a sufficient rate of testing and isolation, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 would be reduced well below 1.0, and the epidemic would collapse. The approach does not rely on strong and\/or unrealistic assumptions about test accuracy, compliance to isolation, population structure or epidemiological parameters, and its success can be monitored in real time by measuring the change of the test positivity rate over time. In addition to the rate of compliance and false negatives, the required rate of testing is dependent on the design of the testing regime, with concurrent testing outperforming random sampling of individuals. Provided that results are reported rapidly, the test frequency required to suppress an epidemic is linear with respect to R0, to the infectious period, and to the fraction of susceptible individuals. Importantly, the testing regime would be effective at any level of prevalence, and additive to other interventions such as contact tracing and social distancing. It would also be robust to failure, as even in the case where the testing rate would be insufficient to collapse the epidemic, it would still reduce the number of infected individuals in the population, improving both public health and economic conditions. A mass-produced, disposable antigen or RNA test that could be used at home would be ideal, due to the optimal performance of concurrent tests that return immediate results.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jussi Taipale","author_inst":"University  of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Paul Romer","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Sten Linnarsson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Michael Hannemann","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Vincent G Umathum","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Niklas Gebauer","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Marcel Stahl","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Hanno M Witte","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Konrad Steinestel","author_inst":"Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"John Moran","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, South Australia."},{"author_name":"Frank Van Haren","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Canberra Hospital, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gordon Doig","author_inst":"Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sachin Gupta","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Angajendra Ghosh","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simone Said","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Santamaria","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078717","rel_title":"Full lockdown policies in Western Europe countries have no evident impacts on the COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078717","rel_abs":"This phenomenological study assesses the impacts of full lockdown strategies applied in Italy, France, Spain and United Kingdom, on the slowdown of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak.
