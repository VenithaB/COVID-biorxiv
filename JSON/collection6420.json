Most research on therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 focused on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein, whereas the vulnerable epitopes and functional mechanism of non-RBD regions are poorly understood. Here we isolated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from convalescent COVID-19 patients. An mAb targeting the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, named 4A8, exhibits high neutralization potency against both authentic and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, although it does not block the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and S protein. The cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in complex with 4A8 has been determined to an overall resolution of 3.1 Angstrom and local resolution of 3.4 Angstrom for the 4A8-NTD interface, revealing detailed interactions between the NTD and 4A8. Our functional and structural characterizations discover a new vulnerable epitope of the S protein and identify promising neutralizing mAbs as potential clinical therapy for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiangyang Chi","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Renhong Yan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Biology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, School of Life Sciences, Westlake Univer"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Guanying Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Biology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, School of Life Sciences, Westlake Univer"},{"author_name":"Meng Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhe Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Fan","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yunzhu Dong","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yilong Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhengshan Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yingying Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Biology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, School of Life Sciences, Westlake Univer"},{"author_name":"Jinlong Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yaning Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiaohong Song","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yi Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lu Xia","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Ling Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lihua Hou","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Changming Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jianmin Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qiang Zhou","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Biology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, School of Life Sciences, Westlake Univer"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.083618","rel_title":"Multiple expression assessments of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 SARS-CoV-2 entry molecules in the urinary tract and their associations with clinical manifestations of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.083618","rel_abs":"BackgroundSince December 2019, the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first spread quickly in Wuhan, China, then globally. From previously published evidence, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are both pivotal entry molecules that enable cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or a \"cytokine storm,\" is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is often observed in critically ill patients.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in major organs in the human body, especially under specific disease conditions. Multiple sequence alignment of ACE2 in different species was used to explain animal susceptibility. Moreover, the cell-specific expression patterns of ACE2 and cytokine receptors in the urinary tract were assessed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Additional biological relevance was determined through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using an ACE2 specific signature.\n\nResultsOur results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in genitourinary organs. ACE2 was highly and significantly expressed in the kidney among individuals with chronic kidney diseases or diabetic nephropathy. In single cells, ACE2 was primarily enriched in gametocytes in the testis, and renal proximal tubules. The receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL6ST, were remarkably concentrated in endothelial cells, macrophages, and spermatogonial stem cells in the testis, and renal endothelial cells, which suggested the occurrence of alternative damaging mechanisms via autoimmune attacks.\n\nConclusionsThis study provided new insights into the pathogenicity mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 that underlie the clinical manifestations observed in the human testis and kidney. These observations might substantially facilitate the development of effective treatments for this rapidly spreading disease.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaohan Ren","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Xiyi Wei","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Guangyao Li","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Shancheng Ren","author_inst":"Changhai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Chen","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhang","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Zhongwen Lu","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Zebing You","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Shanqiang Wang","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Chao Qin","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Ninghong Song","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Zengjun Wang","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Yaning Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiaohong Song","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yi Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lu Xia","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Ling Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lihua Hou","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Changming Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jianmin Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qiang Zhou","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Biology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, School of Life Sciences, Westlake Univer"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.084061","rel_title":"Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to human, pet, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts ACE2 and ACE2 receptors","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.084061","rel_abs":"The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, resulted in a pandemic. Here, we used recently released X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptor allows to define residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S up to seven can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S-binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or the acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S-interface. Of note, pigs and dogs which are not or not effectively infected, respectively, have only a few changes in the binding site have relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with viruses from bat and pangolin revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas the bat virus exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibit seven changes relative to human ACE2, a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon, and civet suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts. These analyses provide new insight into the receptor usage and animal source\/origin of SARS-COV-2.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 is threatening people worldwide and there are no drugs or vaccines available to mitigate its spread. The origin of the virus is still unclear and whether pets and livestock can be infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes indicating that the species barrier might be low. However, the lower expression of ACE2 in the upper respiratory tract of some pets and livestock means more research and monitoring should be done to explore the animal source of infection and the risk of potential cross-species transmission. Finally, the analysis also showed that SARS-CoV-2 may not specifically adapted to any of its putative intermediate hosts.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Zhai","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Jiumeng Sun","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Yan","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhang","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Zongzheng Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, China."},{"author_name":"Qi Gao","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Wan-Ting He","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Michael Veit","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Center for Infection Medicine, Veterinary Faculty, Free University Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Shuo Su","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Chao Qin","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Ninghong Song","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Zengjun Wang","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China."},{"author_name":"Yaning Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiaohong Song","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yi Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lu Xia","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Ling Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lihua Hou","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Changming Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jianmin Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qiang Zhou","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Biology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, School of Life Sciences, Westlake Univer"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.084384","rel_title":"ACE2 coding variants in different populations and their potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.084384","rel_abs":"The susceptibility of different populations to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood.

Our study reveals novel interaction data on the variants and SARS-CoV-2. We could show that ACE2-K26R; which is more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population decrease the electrostatic attraction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2.

We here describe and apply an analytical pipeline that is a compromise between fast and rigorous analytical steps. As a proof of concept, we focus on the Belgium epidemic, with one of the highest spatial density of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. At the global scale, our analyses confirm the importance of external introduction events in establishing multiple transmission chains in the country. At the country scale, our spatially-explicit phylogeographic analyses highlight that the national lockdown had a relatively low impact on both the lineage dispersal velocity and the long-distance dispersal events within Belgium. Our pipeline has the potential to be quickly applied to other countries or regions, with key benefits in complementing epidemiological analyses in assessing the impact of intervention measures or their progressive easement.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon Dellicour","author_inst":"KULeuven - University of Leuven"},{"author_name":"Keith Durkin","author_inst":"University of Liege"},{"author_name":"Samuel L.

Here, we present our study elucidating the interplay between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses; and hosts miRNAs, an epigenetic regulator, as a mode of pathogenesis, and enlightened how the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections differ in terms of their miRNA mediated interactions with host and its implications in the disease complexity. We have utilized computational approaches to predict potential host and viral miRNAs, and their possible roles in different important functional pathways. We have identified several putative host antiviral miRNAs that can target the SARS viruses, and also SARS viruses encoded miRNAs targeting host genes. In silico predicted targets were also integrated with SARS infected human cells microarray and RNA-seq gene expression data. Comparison of the host miRNA binding profiles on 67 different SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 24 different countries with respective countrys normalized death count surprisingly uncovered some miRNA clusters which are associated with increased death rates. We have found that induced cellular miRNAs can be both a boon and a bane to the host immunity, as they have possible roles in neutralizing the viral threat, parallelly, they can also function as proviral factors. On the other hand, from over representation analysis, interestingly our study revealed that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral miRNAs could target broad immune signaling pathways; only some of the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs are found to uniquely target some immune signaling pathways like-autophagy, IFN-I signaling etc, which might suggest their immune-escape mechanisms for prolonged latency inside some hosts without any symptoms of COVID-19. Further, SARS-CoV-2 can modulate several important cellular pathways which might lead to the increased anomalies in patients with comorbidities like-cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, breathing complications, etc. This might suggest that miRNAs can be a key epigenetic modulator behind the overcomplications amongst the COVID-19 patients. Our results support that miRNAs of host and SARS-CoV-2 can indeed play a role in the pathogenesis which can be further concluded with more experiments. These results will also be useful in designing RNA therapeutics to alleviate the complications from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

The peptide has recently been shown to bind the viral RBD with good efficiency. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the energetics of binding of the peptide to the SARS-CoV2 RBD. We use equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation to study the dynamics of the complex. We perform end-state binding energy calculations to gain a residue-level insight into the binding process and use the information to incorporate point mutations into the peptide. We demonstrate using binding energy calculations that the peptide with certain point mutations, especially E17L, shows a stronger binding to the RBD as compared to the wild type peptide.

At a molecular level, the bottleneck for the infection is the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein to ACE2, an enzyme exposed on human cell membranes. Several experimental structures of the ACE2:RBD complex have been made available, however they offer only a static description of the arrangements of the molecules in either the free or bound states. In order to gain a dynamic description of the binding process that is key to infection, we use molecular simulations with a coarse grained model of the RBD and ACE2. We find that binding occurs in an all-or-none way, without intermediates, and that even in the bound state, the RBD exhibits a considerably dynamic behaviour. From short equilibrium simulations started in the unbound state we provide snapshots that result in a tentative mechanism of binding. Our findings may be important for the development of drug discovery strategies that target the RBD.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David De Sancho","author_inst":"UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Raul Perez-Jimenez","author_inst":"CIC nanoGUNE"},{"author_name":"Jose A Gavira","author_inst":"Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra (CSIC - UGR)"},{"author_name":"Md.

This is a member of Coronaviridae family in the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. In particular, the interaction of viral spike proteins with ACE2 is a critical step in the viral replication cycle. The receptor binding domain of the viral spike proteins and ACE2 have several cysteine residues. In this study, the role of thiol-disulfide balance on the interactions between SARS-CoV\/CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 was investigated using molecular dynamic simulations. The study revealed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all the disulfide bonds of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV\/CoV-2 spike proteins were reduced to thiol groups. The impact on the binding affinity was less severe when the disulfide bridges of only one of the binding partners were reduced to thiols. This computational finding provides a molecular basis for the severity of COVID-19 infection due to the oxidative stress.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sudeep Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire"},{"author_name":"Sanchita Hati","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire"},{"author_name":"Jose A Gavira","author_inst":"Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra (CSIC - UGR)"},{"author_name":"Md.

It achieves this by coupling a simple RNA extraction protocol with low-volume RT-PCR, followed by E-Gel screening and sequencing on high-throughput platforms to analyze 10,000 samples in a run. Slight modifications to the protocol could support screening programs for other known viruses and for viral discovery.

We aim at investigating the sociodemographic and environmental determinants of wellbeing during global lockdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide survey was sent online to the French population during the second week of global lockdown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between March 25, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Volunteers were recruited on social networks, online newspapers, and mailing lists. We analyzed sociodemographic and environmental variables obtained from a co-built and evidence-based questionnaire. Mental wellbeing was measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Results: We analyzed data from 11,391 (56.6%) out of 20,235 participants who answered the questionnaire. After weighting data on age and gender distributions, 5415 of the respondents were male (47.5%), 5932 were female (52.1%), and 52 (0.5%) registered as other. Multivariate analyses indicated that various factors impacted mental wellbeing. Being female (p < .001), a student (p < .001), disabled (p = .001), or having no access to outdoor space (p = 0.02) was associated with lower WEMWBS scores. Conversely, being employed (p < .001) and having more social contacts (p < .01) were both associated with greater mental wellbeing. Interpretation: We revealed differences in mental wellbeing among the French population at the early stages of global lockdown. Authorities should consider the particular vulnerability of students, persons with disabilities, and those living in constrained housing conditions that could increase the negative impact of lockdown on mental health.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederic HAESEBAERT","author_inst":"CH le Vinatier"},{"author_name":"Julie Haesebaert","author_inst":"Lyon University"},{"author_name":"Elodie Zante","author_inst":"Ch Le Vinatier"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Franck","author_inst":"Lyon University"},{"author_name":"Sujeevan Ratnasingham","author_inst":"Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Giulia Piccini","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Manenti","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Troisi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Vacca","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pantano","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta De Santi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cardamone","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Kabanova","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Tumour Immunology Unit, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agrati","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta Castilletti","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Capobianchi","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arianna Emiliozzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Fabbiani","author_inst":"Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Montagnani","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Montomoli","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy; Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Sala","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rino Rappuoli","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.080960","rel_title":"The transcriptomic profiling of COVID-19 compared to SARS, MERS, Ebola, and H1N1","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.080960","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis that threatens our way of life.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the IL-8, IL-6, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of both COVID-19 and Ebola are more similar compared to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alsamman M Alsamman","author_inst":"Search Results Web results  Agricultural Genetic Engineering Research Institute (AGERl)"},{"author_name":"Hatem Zayed","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar."},{"author_name":"Elodie Zante","author_inst":"Ch Le Vinatier"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Franck","author_inst":"Lyon University"},{"author_name":"Sujeevan Ratnasingham","author_inst":"Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Giulia Piccini","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Manenti","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Troisi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Vacca","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pantano","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta De Santi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cardamone","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Kabanova","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Tumour Immunology Unit, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agrati","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta Castilletti","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Capobianchi","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arianna Emiliozzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Fabbiani","author_inst":"Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Montagnani","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Montomoli","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy; Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Sala","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rino Rappuoli","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20088625","rel_title":"Health Care WorkersMental Health During the First Weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Switzerland: A Cross-Sectional Study","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20088625","rel_abs":"Background: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses various challenges for health care workers (HCWs), which may impair their mental health. First evidence from China suggests that HCWs are at risk for anxiety and depression. However, generalizability to western countries is limited. The current study aimed at exploring HCWs mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland. In addition, we conducted a network analysis to investigate the independent effect of risk and protective factors on HCWs mental health and their interplay. Methods: In an exploratory, cross-sectional, nation-wide online survey, we assessed demographics, work characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and anxiety, depression, and burnout in 857 physicians and 553 nurses during the pandemic in Switzerland. At the time of data collection, Switzerland had among the highest per capita rate of COVID-19 cases in the world. Results: Overall symptom levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout were elevated. Women, nurses, frontline staff and HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients reported more symptoms than their peers. However, these effects were all small and, in the network analysis, most of them did not remain significant after controlling for the other factors. Whereas COVID-19 exposure was only partially associated with mental health, perceived support by the employer independently predicted anxiety and burnout. Conclusions: Our finding that HCWs had elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout underscores the importance to systematically monitor HCWs mental health during this ongoing pandemic. Because perceived support and mental health impairments were negatively related, we encourage the implementation of supportive measures for HCWs well-being during this crisis.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sonja Weilenmann","author_inst":"Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Jutta Ernst","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Nursing Science, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Heidi Petry","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Nursing Science, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Onur Sazpinar","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Spital Zollikerberg"},{"author_name":"Monique C Pfaltz","author_inst":"University of Zurich and Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Samuel Gehrke","author_inst":"Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Francesca Paolercio","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Roland von Kaenel","author_inst":"Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Tobias Raphael Spiller","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pantano","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta De Santi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cardamone","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Kabanova","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Tumour Immunology Unit, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agrati","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta Castilletti","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Capobianchi","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arianna Emiliozzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Fabbiani","author_inst":"Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Montagnani","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Montomoli","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy; Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Sala","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rino Rappuoli","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.082297","rel_title":"Lung biopsy cells transcriptional landscape from COVID-19 patient stratified lung injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection through impaired pulmonary surfactant metabolism","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.082297","rel_abs":"Clinical management of COVID-19 is still complicated due to the lack of therapeutic interventions to reduce the breathing problems, respiratory complications and acute lung injury - which are the major complications of most of the mild to critically affected patients and the molecular mechanisms behind these clinical features are still largely unknown. In this study, we have used the RNA-seq gene expression pattern in the COVID-19 affected lung biopsy cells and compared it with the effects observed in typical cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We performed functional overrepresentation analyses using these differentially expressed genes to signify the processes\/pathways which could be deregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in the symptomatic impairments observed in COVID-19. Our results showed that the significantly altered processes include inflammatory responses, antiviral cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and interleukin signaling etc. along with downmodulated processes related to lungs functionality like-responses to hypoxia, lung development, respiratory processes, cholesterol biosynthesis and surfactant metabolism. We also found that the viral protein interacting hosts proteins involved in similar pathways like: respiratory failure, lung diseases, asthma, and hypoxia responses etc., suggesting viral proteins might be deregulating the processes related to acute lung injury\/breathing complications in COVID-19 patients. Protein-protein interaction networks of these processes and map of gene expression of deregulated genes revealed that several viral proteins can directly or indirectly modulate the host genes\/proteins of those lung related processes along with several host transcription factors and miRNAs. Surfactant proteins and their regulators SPD, SPC, TTF1 etc. which maintains the stability of the pulmonary tissue are found to be downregulated through viral NSP5, NSP12 that could lead to deficient gaseous exchange by the surface films. Mitochondrial dysfunction owing to the aberration of NDUFA10, NDUFAF5, SAMM50 etc. by NSP12; abnormal thrombosis in lungs through atypical PLAT, EGR1 functions by viral ORF8, NSP12; dulled hypoxia responses due to unusual shift in HIF-1 downstream signaling might be the causative elements behind the acute lung injury in COVID-19 patients. Our study put forward a distinct mechanism of probable virus induced lung damage apart from cytokine storm and advocate the need of further research for alternate therapy in this direction.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abul B.M.M.K.

To address this question we located 11 databases of US states that provide date-authenticated information (actual date of symptom onset and\/or specimen collection, or actual hospitalization or death date) that reported more than 1,000 deaths each. Numbers of new cases showed a weekly cyclic pattern in 10 out of 11 states, commonly peaking on weekdays, 2-6 days after the weekend, corresponding with a reported median 5-day lag between infection and the manifestation of clinical symptoms. We postulate that this pattern emerges from interactions with different and\/or extended social-circles during weekends, including increased inter-generational meetings, which in turn facilitate transfer of COVID-19 from younger people to older vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, we found weekly periodicity in hospitalizations in 2 out of 2 authenticated databases providing this information. Actual death date, which is more difficult to attribute to individual choice, and is expected to occur approximately 2-3 weeks following hospitalization, showed significant 7-day periodicity in 1 out of 11 states, and a trend in 2 additional states. If weekly peaks in new cases can be truncated by physical\/social distancing, especially during weekends, the mortality of COVID-19 may be reduced, or at least hospitalization and mortality curves may be flattened.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Itay Ricon-Becker","author_inst":"Tel-Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Tarrasch","author_inst":"Tel-Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Pablo Blinder","author_inst":"Tel-Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Shamgar Ben-Eliyahu","author_inst":"Tel-Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Monique C Pfaltz","author_inst":"University of Zurich and Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Samuel Gehrke","author_inst":"Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Francesca Paolercio","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Roland von Kaenel","author_inst":"Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Tobias Raphael Spiller","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pantano","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta De Santi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cardamone","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Kabanova","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Tumour Immunology Unit, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agrati","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta Castilletti","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Capobianchi","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arianna Emiliozzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Fabbiani","author_inst":"Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Montagnani","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Montomoli","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy; Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Sala","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rino Rappuoli","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.050260","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 proteins exploit host's genetic and epigenetic mediators for the annexation of key host signaling pathways that confers its immune evasion and disease pathophysiology","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.050260","rel_abs":"The constant rise of the death toll and cases of COVID-19 has made this pandemic a serious threat to human civilization. Understanding of host-SARS-CoV-2 interaction in viral pathogenesis is still in its infancy. In this study we aimed to correlate how SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its proteins for tackling the host immune response; parallelly, how host epigenetic factors might play a role in this pathogenesis was also investigated. We have utilized a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to elucidate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2. Integrating the experimentally validated host interactome proteins and differentially expressed host genes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have taken a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to delineate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2 in various signaling pathways. Also, we have shown how host epigenetic factors are involved in the deregulation of gene expression. Strikingly, we have found that several transcription factors and other epigenetic factors can modulate some immune signaling pathways, helping both host and virus. We have identified miRNA hsa-miR-429 whose transcription factor was also upregulated and targets were downregulated and this miRNA can have pivotal role in suppression of host immune responses. While searching for the pathways in which viral proteins interact with host proteins, we have found pathways like-HIF-1 signaling, autophagy, RIG-I signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, Fatty acid oxidation\/degradation, Il-17 signaling etc significantly associated. We observed that these pathways can be either hijacked or suppressed by the viral proteins, leading to the improved viral survival and life-cycle. Moreover, pathways like-Relaxin signaling in lungs suggests aberration by the viral proteins might lead to the lung pathophysiology found in COVID-19. Also, enrichment analyses suggest that deregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in heart development, kidney development, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications etc. might suggest why patients with comorbidities are becoming more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 integrates its proteins in different immune signaling pathway and other cellular signaling pathways for developing efficient immune evasion mechanisms, while leading the host to more complicated disease condition. Our findings would help in designing more targeted therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

Phylogenetic analysis showed multiple spatiotemporal introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the UAE from Asia, Europe, and the Middle East during the early phase of the pandemic. We also provide evidence for early community-based transmission and catalogue new mutations in SARS-CoV-2 strains in the UAE. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Loney","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hamda Khansaheb","author_inst":"Medical Education & Research Department, Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Zulfa Deesi","author_inst":"Latifa Women and Children Hospital, Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Rupa Varghese","author_inst":"Latifa Women and Children Hospital, Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Hanan Al Suwaidi","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Abdulmajeed Alkhajeh","author_inst":"Medical Education & Research Department, Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Laila AlDabal","author_inst":"Rashid Hospital, Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Uddin","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Abiola Senok","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rifat Hamoudi","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rabih Halwani","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Hamid","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Norbert Nowotny","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna"},{"author_name":"Alawi Alsheikh-Ali","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Concetta Castilletti","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Capobianchi","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arianna Emiliozzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Fabbiani","author_inst":"Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Montagnani","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Montomoli","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy; Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Sala","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rino Rappuoli","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20086819","rel_title":"Real-time assessment of COVID-19 impact on global surgical case volumes","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20086819","rel_abs":"Abstract Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global surgical capacity. The impact of the pandemic in low and middle income countries has the potential to worsen already strained access to surgical care. Timely assessment of surgical volumes in these countries remains challenging. Objective: To determine whether usage data from a globally used anesthesiology calculator mobile application can serve as a proxy for global surgical case volume and contribute to monitoring of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in World Bank low income countries where official data collection is not currently practical. Design: Subset of data from an ongoing observational cohort study of users of the application collected from October 1, 2018 to April 18, 2020. Setting: The mobile application is available from public sources; users download and use the application per their own clinical needs on personal mobile devices. Participants: No user data was excluded from the study. Exposure(s): Events with impacts on surgical case volumes, including weekends, holidays, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): It was previously noted that application usage was decreased on weekends and during winter holidays. We subsequently hypothesized that more detailed analysis would reveal impacts of country-specific or region-specific holidays on the volume of app use. Results: 4,300,975 data points from 92,878 unique users were analyzed. Physicians and other anesthesia providers comprised 85.8% of the study population. Application use was reduced on holidays and weekends and correlated with fluctuations in surgical volume. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial reductions in app use globally and regionally. There was strong cross correlation between COVID-19 case count and reductions in app use. By country, there was a median global reduction in app use to 58% of baseline (interquartile range, 46%-75%). Application use in low-income continues to decline but in high-income countries has stabilized. Conclusions and Relevance: Application usage metadata provides a real-time indicator of surgical volume. This data may be used to identify impacted regions where disruptions to surgical care are disproportionate or prolonged. A dashboard for continuous visualization of these data has been deployed.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vikas N O'Reilly-Shah","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Wil Van Cleve","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Dustin R Long","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Moll","author_inst":"Institute of Anesthesiology, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Faye M Evans","author_inst":"Boston Childrens Hospital, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Sunshine","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Kassebaum","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ewen M Harrison","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Craig S Jabaley","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Rifat Hamoudi","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rabih Halwani","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Hamid","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Norbert Nowotny","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna"},{"author_name":"Alawi Alsheikh-Ali","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Concetta Castilletti","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Capobianchi","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arianna Emiliozzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Fabbiani","author_inst":"Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Montagnani","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Montomoli","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy; Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Sala","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rino Rappuoli","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20084624","rel_title":"Quantifying the social distancing privilege gap: a longitudinal study of smartphone movement","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20084624","rel_abs":"Background: In response to the coronavirus pandemic, social distancing became a widely deployed countermeasure in March 2020. We examined whether healthier and wealthier places more successfully implemented social distancing. Methods: Mobile device location data were used to quantify declines in movement by county (n=2,633) in the United States of America, comparing April 15-17 (n=65,544,268 traces) to baseline of February 17 - March 7. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate gradients of privilege across eleven healthcare and economic indicators, adjusting for rurality and stay-at-home mandates. External validation used separate venue-specific data from Google Location Services. Findings: Counties without stay-at-home orders showed a mobility decline of -52.3% (95% CI: -50.3%, -54.3%), slightly less than the decline in mandated areas (-60.8%; 95% CI: -60.0%, -61.6%). Strong linear gradients in privilege were observed. After adjusting for rurality and stay-at-home orders, counties in the highest quintile of social distancing mobility restriction had: 52% less uninsured, 47% more primary care providers, 29% more exercise space, 27% less food insecurity, 26% less child poverty, 17% higher incomes, 14% less overcrowding, 9.6% more racial segregation, 8.2% less youth, 7.4% more elderly, and 6.2% less influenza vaccination, compared to least social distancing areas. Interpretation: Healthier and wealthier counties displayed a social distancing privilege gap, measured via smartphone mobility change. Structural inequities in this key countermeasure will influence immunity, and disease incidence and mortality.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nabarun Dasgupta","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Michele Jonsson Funk","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Allison Lazard","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Eugene White","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Stephen W.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyle at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours. Methods Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portugese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions. Results 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included into a general analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all intensities of PA (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Conversely, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 hours per day. Additionally, food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of meals) were more unhealthy during confinement with only alcohol binge drink decreasing significantly. Conclusion While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, our results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a direction that would compromise health. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups which will help develop bespoke interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviors manifest during the COVID-19 confinement.","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ACHRAF AMMAR","author_inst":"Otto-Von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Khaled Trabelsi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Hamdi Chtourou","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Boukhris","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Liwa Masmoudi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Leipziger Str. 44, Magdeburg, 39120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Leipziger Str. 44, Magdeburg, 39120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart | UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"Paris-East Creteil University, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Nicola Bragazzi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), Postgraduate School of Public Health, University of Genoa, Genoa 16132, Italy"},{"author_name":"Karim Chamari","author_inst":"Department of Research and Education \/ Aspetar, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Jordan M Glenn","author_inst":"Exercise Science Research Center, Department of Health, Human Performance and Recreation, University of Arkansas, AR 72701, Fayetteville, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas T Bott","author_inst":"Clinical Excellence Research Center, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, Stanford, USA"},{"author_name":"Faiez Gargouri","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Lotfi Chaari","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Hadj Batatia","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Gamal Mohamed Ali","author_inst":"Faculty of Physical Education, Assiut University, Assiut 71515, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Osama Abdelkarim","author_inst":"Karlsruher Institut for Technologie, Karlsruher, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Jarraya","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kais El Abed","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Nizar Souissi","author_inst":"Observatoire National du Sport, Tunis, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Lisette Van Gemert-Pijnen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Bryan L Riemann","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA 30458, USA"},{"author_name":"Laurel Riemann","author_inst":"PharmD, BCBS;

Background: Extra-pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 has been reported in the hepatic, renal and hematological systems. Most neurological manifestations are non-focal but few have reported the characteristics of ischemic strokes or investigated its pathophysiology. Methods: Over the last 6 weeks, data from four centers in New York City were collected to review the possible ischemic stroke types seen in COVID-19 positive patients. Their presentation, demographics, other related vascular risk factors, associated laboratory and coagulation markers, as well as imaging and outcomes were collected. Results: In our study, age range of patients was 25-75 with no significant male preponderance. 70% presented for acute hospitalization due the stroke. About a fifth did not have common risk factors for ischemic stroke like diabetes and hypertension. None had history of atrial fibrillation or smoking. 50% had poor outcome with four ending in mortality and one in a critical condition due ARDS. All had high Neutrophil\/Lymphocyte ratio except one who demonstrated some neurological recovery. In 70% of our cases, D-dimer levels were collected, and all showed mild to severe elevation. None of the emergent large vessel occlusion (LVO) cases had known cardiac risk factors but two out of five were found to have cardiac abnormalities during the course of their hospitalization. All LVOs had hypercoagulable lab markers especially elevated D-dimer and\/or Fibrinogen. The LVO patients were younger and sicker with a median age of 46 and mean NIHSS of 24 as opposed to non-LVOs with a median age of 62 and mean NIHSS of 6 respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 related ischemic events can be small vessel, branch emboli or large vessel occlusions. The latter is often associated with either a hypercoagulable state or cardio-embolism.

Data sources We will conduct searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of vitamin C, as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs, versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating vitamin C in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.

Design Epidemiological observational study. Setting Two large hospitals and 40 territorial healthcare units, with a total of 5700 workers. Participants 143 HCWs with a SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal (NF) swab in a population made of 5,700 HCWs. Main outcome measures Clinical data on the history of exposure, contacts inside and outside of the hospital, NF swab dates and results. A daily online self-reported case report form consisting of the morning and evening body temperature and 11 other symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, discomfort, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, anosmia, dysgeusia, conjunctival hyperaemia). Results Most workers were tested and found positive due to a close contact with a positive colleague (49%), followed by worker-initiated testing due to symptoms (and unknown contact, 28%), and a SARS-CoV-2 positive member of the family (9.8%). 10% of NF swabs performed in the framework of contact tracing resulted positive, compared to only 2.6% through random testing. The first (index) case caused a cluster of 7 positive HCWs discovered through contact tracing and testing of 250 asymptomatic HCWs. HCWs rarely reported symptoms of a respiratory infection, and up to 90% were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms in the days surrounding the positive NF swab. During the 15-day follow-up period, up to 40% of HCWs reported anosmia and dysgeusia\/ageusia as moderate or heavy, more frequently than any other symptom. The time necessary for 95% of HCWs to be considered cured (between the positive and two negative NF swabs) was 30 days. Conclusion HCWs represent the main source of infection in healthcare institutions, 90% are asymptomatic or with symptoms not common in a respiratory infection. The time needed to overcome the infection in 95% of workers was 30 days. Contact tracing allows identifying asymptomatic workers which would spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital and is a more successful strategy than random testing.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefan Mandi\u0107-Raj\u010devi\u0107","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit,

patients with mild COVID-19 through patient-reported outcome questionnaires and objective psychophysical testing. Methods: Adult patients with COVID-19 and self-reported sudden-onset olfactory dysfunction were recruited through a public call for participation from the University of Mons. Demographic data, pathologic conditions, general and otolaryngological symptoms were collected, and general nasal complaints were evaluated with the sino-nasal outcome-22 (SNOT-22). Subjective olfactory and gustatory status was evaluated with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHNES) and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements. Objective olfactory status was evaluated using an objective psychophysical test (Identification Sniffin Stick test). Results : 86 patients completed the study. The mean age was 42 + or - 12 years. The most common symptoms were fatigue (75%), headache (63%), nasal obstruction (58%), dysgeusia (51%), postnasal drip (49%), cough (49%) and myalgia (46%). On NHNES, total loss of taste and smell were reported by 51% and 74% of patients, respectively. 65% of patients reported a total loss of smell, while the remainder reported a partial loss. Objective olfactory testing found 41 anosmic (48%), 12 hyposmics (14%), and 33 normosmics (38%) patients. There was no correlation between the objective test results and subjective reports of nasal obstruction or postnasal drip, these complaints were absent in 69% of anosmic patients.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemics strain health systems and households. Health systems in Africa and South Asia may be particularly at risk due to potential high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, large household sizes and limited healthcare capacity. Methods. We investigated the impact of an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic on health system resources and costs, and household costs, in Karachi, Delhi, Nairobi, Addis Ababa and Johannesburg. We adapted a dynamic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease to capture country-specific demography and contact patterns. The epidemiological model was then integrated into an economic framework that captured city-specific health systems and household resource use. Findings. The cities severely lack intensive care beds, healthcare workers and financial resources to meet demand during an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic. A highly mitigated COVID-19 epidemic, under optimistic assumptions, may avoid overwhelming hospital bed capacity in some cities, but not critical care capacity. Interpretation. Viable mitigation strategies encompassing a mix of responses need to be established to expand healthcare capacity, reduce peak demand for healthcare resources, minimise progression to critical care and shield those at greatest risk of severe disease.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sedona Sweeney","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sergio Torres-Rueda","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fiammetta Bozzani","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nichola Kitson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Simon Procter","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Quaife","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anna Vassall","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicola Vincenzo Orfeo","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit, International Centre for Rural Health and Central Health Care Management of the Sa"},{"author_name":"Giusepe Ortisi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit, International Centre for Rural Health and Central Health Care Management of the Sa"},{"author_name":"Claudio Colosio","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit, International Centre for Rural Health and Central Health Care Management of the Sa"},{"author_name":"Shadi Yaghi","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Lord","author_inst":"NYU Langone health"},{"author_name":"Karthikeyan Arcot","author_inst":"Interventional Neuro Associates, NYU Langone health, Jamaical Hospital Medical Center, Brookdaly University Hospital Medical Center, Richmond University Medical"},{"author_name":"Ambooj Tiwari","author_inst":"Interventional Neuro Associates,  NYU Langone health, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Richmond University Medical"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"Paris-East Creteil University, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Nicola Bragazzi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), Postgraduate School of Public Health, University of Genoa, Genoa 16132, Italy"},{"author_name":"Karim Chamari","author_inst":"Department of Research and Education \/ Aspetar, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Jordan M Glenn","author_inst":"Exercise Science Research Center, Department of Health, Human Performance and Recreation, University of Arkansas, AR 72701, Fayetteville, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas T Bott","author_inst":"Clinical Excellence Research Center, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, Stanford, USA"},{"author_name":"Faiez Gargouri","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Lotfi Chaari","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Hadj Batatia","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Gamal Mohamed Ali","author_inst":"Faculty of Physical Education, Assiut University, Assiut 71515, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Osama Abdelkarim","author_inst":"Karlsruher Institut for Technologie, Karlsruher, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Jarraya","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kais El Abed","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Nizar Souissi","author_inst":"Observatoire National du Sport, Tunis, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Lisette Van Gemert-Pijnen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Bryan L Riemann","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA 30458, USA"},{"author_name":"Laurel Riemann","author_inst":"PharmD, BCBS;

Hospital systems across the world have been over-extended, including in Northern Italy, Ecuador, and New York City, and many other systems face similar challenges. As a result, decisions on how to best allocate very limited medical resources have come to the forefront. Specifically, under consideration are decisions on who to test, who to admit into hospitals, who to treat in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who to support with a ventilator. Given today's ability to gather, share, analyze and process data, personalized predictive models based on demographics and information regarding prior conditions can be used to (1) help decision-makers allocate limited resources, when needed, (2) advise individuals how to better protect themselves given their risk profile, (3) differentiate social distancing guidelines based on risk, and (4) prioritize vaccinations once a vaccine becomes available. Objective: To develop personalized models that predict the following events: (1) hospitalization, (2) mortality, (3) need for ICU, and (4) need for a ventilator. To predict hospitalization, it is assumed that one has access to a patient's basic preconditions, which can be easily gathered without the need to be at a hospital. For the remaining models, different versions developed include different sets of a patient's features, with some including information on how the disease is progressing (e.g., diagnosis of pneumonia). Materials and Methods: Data from a publicly available repository, updated daily, containing information from approximately 91,000 patients in Mexico were used. The data for each patient include demographics, prior medical conditions, SARS-CoV-2 test results, hospitalization, mortality and whether a patient has developed pneumonia or not. Several classification methods were applied, including robust versions of logistic regression, and support vector machines, as well as random forests and gradient boosted decision trees. Results: Interpretable methods (logistic regression and support vector machines) perform just as well as more complex models in terms of accuracy and detection rates, with the additional benefit of elucidating variables on which the predictions are based. Classification accuracies reached 61%, 76%, 83%, and 84% for predicting hospitalization, mortality, need for ICU and need for a ventilator, respectively. The analysis reveals the most important preconditions for making the predictions. For the four models derived, these are: (1) for hospitalization: age, gender, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes, immunosuppression; (2) for mortality: age, SARS-CoV-2 test status, immunosuppression and pregnancy; (3) for ICU need: development of pneumonia (if available), cardiovascular disease, asthma, and SARS-CoV-2 test status; and (4) for ventilator need: ICU and pneumonia (if available), age, gender, cardiovascular disease, obesity, pregnancy, and SARS-CoV-2 test result.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Salomon Wollenstein-Betech","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Christos G.
