In the absence of a vaccine or efficient treatment, cost-effective epidemiological surveillance strategies are urgently needed. Methods: Here, we have used RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a series of longitudinal metropolitan wastewaters samples collected during the earliest stages of the epidemic in the Region of Valencia, Spain. Results: We were able to consistently detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples taken when communicated cases in that region were only incipient. We also find that the wastewater viral RNA context increased rapidly and anticipated the subsequent ascent in the number of declared cases. Interpretation: Our results strongly suggest that the virus was undergoing community transmission earlier than previously believed, and show that wastewater analysis is a sensitive and cost-effective strategy for COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance. Routine implementation of this surveillance tool would significantly improve our preparedness against new or re-occurring viral outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Walter Randazzo","author_inst":"Department of Preservation and Food Safety Technologies, IATA-CSIC, 46980 Paterna, Spain and Department of Microbiology and Ecology, Universitat de Valencia, 46"},{"author_name":"Enric Cuevas-Ferrando","author_inst":"Department of Preservation and Food Safety Technologies, ,IATA-CSIC, 46980 Paterna, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Sanjuan","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology, I2SysBio, Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, 46980 Paterna, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pilar Domingo-Calap","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology, I2SysBio, Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, 46980 Paterna, Spain and Department of Genetics, Universitat de Valencia, 469"},{"author_name":"Gloria Sanchez","author_inst":"Department of Preservation and Food Safety Technologies, IATA-CSIC, 46980 Paterna, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076521","rel_title":"Geo-social gradients in predicted COVID-19 prevalence and severity in Great Britain: results from 2,266,235 users of the COVID-19 Symptoms Tracker app","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076521","rel_abs":"Understanding the geographical distribution of COVID-19 through the general population is key to the provision of adequate healthcare services.

COVID-19 deaths, in contrast, are being reported as raw counts. In this report, we compare COVID-19 death counts to seasonal influenza death counts in New York City during the interval from February 1 - April 18, 2020. Using this approach, COVID-19 appears to have caused 21.4 times the number of deaths as seasonal influenza during the same period. We also assessed excess mortality in order to verify this finding. New York City has had approximately 13,032 excess all-cause mortality deaths during this time period. We assume that most of these deaths are COVID-19 related. We therefore calculated the ratio of excess deaths (i.e. assumed COVID-19 deaths) to seasonal influenza deaths during the same time interval and found a similar ratio of 21.1 COVID-19 to seasonal influenza deaths. Our findings are consistent with conditions on the ground today. Comparing COVID-19 deaths with CDC estimates of yearly influenza-related deaths would suggest that, this year, seasonal influenza has killed approximately the same number of Americans as COVID-19 has. This does not comport with the realities of the pandemic we see today.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy Faust","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Carlos del Rio","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Hubert Department of Global Health; Epidemiology; Medicine, Emory University School of Medicin"},{"author_name":"Carole H Sudre","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maxim Freidin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Darioush Yarand","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sajaysurya Ganesh","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Ellen J Thompson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Elco Bakker","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"M Jorge Cardoso","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Davies","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Tim D Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire J Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Cristina Menni","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20076430","rel_title":"A poor-man's approach to the effective reproduction number: the COVID-19 case","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20076430","rel_abs":"It is shown that estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt for COVID-19 using standard packages such as EPIESTIM can be reproduced very accurately using the expression Rt = c(t) \/c(t + {tau}) , where c(t) is the incidence at time t and {tau} the mean value of the series interval","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Menendez","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Carlos del Rio","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Hubert Department of Global Health; Epidemiology; Medicine, Emory University School of Medicin"},{"author_name":"Carole H Sudre","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maxim Freidin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Darioush Yarand","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sajaysurya Ganesh","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Ellen J Thompson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Elco Bakker","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"M Jorge Cardoso","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Davies","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Tim D Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire J Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Cristina Menni","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20076166","rel_title":"Early detection of superspreaders by mass group pool testing can mitigate COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20076166","rel_abs":"Background Most of epidemiological models applied for COVID-19 do not consider heterogeneity in infectiousness and impact of superspreaders, despite the broad viral loading distributions amongst COVID-19 positive people (1-1 000 000 per mL). Also, mass group testing is not used regardless to existing shortage of tests. I propose new strategy for early detection of superspreaders with reasonable number of RT-PCR tests, which can dramatically mitigate development COVID-19 pandemic and even turn it endemic. Methods I used stochastic social-epidemiological SEIAR model, where S-suspected, E-exposed, I-infectious, A-admitted (confirmed COVID-19 positive, who are admitted to hospital or completely isolated), R-recovered. The model was applied to real COVID-19 dynamics in London, Moscow and New York City. Findings Viral loading data measured by RT-PCR were fitted by broad log-normal distribution, which governed high importance of superspreaders. The proposed full scale model of a metropolis shows that top 10% spreaders (100+ higher viral loading than median infector) transmit 45% of new cases. Rapid isolation of superspreaders leads to 4-8 fold mitigation of pandemic depending on applied quarantine strength and amount of currently infected people. High viral loading allows efficient group matrix pool testing of population focused on detection of the superspreaders requiring remarkably small amount of tests. Interpretation The model and new testing strategy may prevent thousand or millions COVID-19 deaths requiring just about 5000 daily RT-PCR test for big 12 million city such as Moscow. Though applied to COVID-19 pandemic the results are universal and can be used for other infectious heterogenous epidemics.

Retina, myocardium, lung, liver, kidney, vascular endothelium and intestinal epithelium originated cells were included in the toxicity evaluation of CQ and HCQ respectively. The proliferation pattern was monitored in 0-72 hours by IncuCyte S3, which could perform long-term continuous image and video of cells upon CQ or HCQ treatment. CC50 and the ratio of tissue trough concentrations to CC50 (RTTCC) were brought into predicted toxicity profiles. The CC50 at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h of CQ and HCQ decreased in the time-dependent manner, which indicates the accumulative cytotoxic effect. HCQ was found to be less toxic in 7 cell types except cardiomyocytes H9C2 cells (CC50-48 h=29.55 M; CC50-72 h=15.26 M). In addition, RTTCC is significant higher in CQ treatment group compared to HCQ group, which indicates that relative safety of HCQ.

With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for safe, broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC50 = 0.01 M). Weaker activity was observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 M) due to their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminished lung viral load and improved pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals. These data provide evidence that RDV is potently active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo, supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea J Pruijssers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amelia S George","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Sch\u00e4fer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kenneth H Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Boyd L Yount","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Maria L Agostini","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Laura J Stevens","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James D Chappell","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaotao Lu","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tia M Hughes","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kendra L Gully","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ariane J Brown","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Rachel L Graham","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Jason K Perry","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Venice Du Pont","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Jared Pitts","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Bin Ma","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Darius Babusis","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.063180","rel_title":"Structure of replicating SARS-CoV-2 polymerase","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.063180","rel_abs":"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes.

The disparate ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract have been demonstrated to influence the replication kinetics of common cold viruses as well as the associated host responses. Here, we employed the human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) culture model to investigate the impact of ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract, 33{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C, respectively, on the viral replication kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, and displayed higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs than SARS-CoV. Time-resolved transcriptome analysis highlighted a temperature-dependent induction of IFN-mediated antiviral response, whose amplitude inversely correlated with the replication kinetic efficiencies of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Altogether, these data reflect clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and subsequently, their associated human-to-human transmission efficiencies. They provide crucial insights of the profound impact of ambient temperatures on viral replication and associated pivotal virus - host interaction dynamics. This knowledge can be exploited for the development of novel intervention strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvio Steiner","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mitra Gultom","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jenna N Kelly","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Julie Russeil","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bastien Mangeat","author_inst":"Gene Expression Core Facility (GECF), School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Elisa Cora","author_inst":"Gene Expression Core Facility (GECF), School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Joern Pezoldt","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Melle Holwerda","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Annika Kratzel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laura Laloli","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Manon Wider","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Portmann","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Tran Thi Nhu Thao","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rune Hartmann","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Vincent Gardeux","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Alpern","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bart Deplancke","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.063859","rel_title":"Role of 1'-Ribose Cyano Substitution for Remdesivir to Effectively Inhibit both Nucleotide Addition and Proofreading in SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA Replication","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.063859","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has recently caused a global health crisis and an effective interventional therapy is urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising but challenging drug target due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN). Remdesivir targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp exerts high drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo. However, its underlying inhibitory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 24 microseconds to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of Remdesivir. We found that Remdesivirs 1-cyano group of possesses the dual role of inhibiting nucleotide addition and proofreading. The presence of its polar 1-cyano group at an upstream site in RdRp causes instability and hampers RdRp translocation. This leads to a delayed chain termination of RNA extension, which may also subsequently reduce the likelihood for Remdesivir to be cleaved by ExoN acting on the 3-terminal nucleotide. In addition, our simulations suggest that Remdesivirs 1-cyano group can also disrupt the cleavage active site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduced cleavage efficiency. Our work provides plausible molecular mechanisms on how Remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication and may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dong Zhang","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Congmin Yuan","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Wang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yongfang Li","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xilin Jia","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xin Gao","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peter Cheung","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuhui Huang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manon Wider","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Portmann","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Tran Thi Nhu Thao","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rune Hartmann","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Vincent Gardeux","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Alpern","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bart Deplancke","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.062471","rel_title":"Emergence of multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 with signature structural changes","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.062471","rel_abs":"This study explores the divergence pattern of SARS-CoV-2 using whole genome sequences of the isolates from various COVID-19 affected countries.

Eosinopenia may predict a poor prognosis of COVID-19. However, to date, there is no detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia. Research question: The aim of this study was to describe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia. Study Design and Methods: This was a multi-center retrospective study conducted in three tertiary hospitals. A total of 59 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed from January 23, 2020 to March 10, 2020. We described clincial characteristics of patients with COIVD-19 and eosinopenia phenotype. Results: The median age of patients with COVID-19 was 39 years old, and 32 (54,2%) were male. Patients with severe type had higher proportions of dyspnea (50%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50%) compared with mild or moderate patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lower counts of lymphocyte and eosnophils were observed in patients with severe type. Cough, sputum, and fatigue were more common symptoms in eosinopenia patients compared with non-eosinopenia patients. High proportion of comorbidities was observed in eosinopenia patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lymphocyte counts (median: 101 cells\/l ) in eosinopenia patients were significantly less than those of non-eosinopenia patients (median: 167 cells\/l, p<0.001). The use of corticosteroids therapy in COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia were notably higher than those in patients with non-eosinopenia (50% vs 13.8%, respectively, p=0.005). Compared with parameters in non-eosinopenia patients, eosinopenia patients were more inclined to have less lymphocyte counts (OR value 6.566, 95%CI[1.101-39.173], p=0.039). Interpretation Eosinopenia are very common in COVID-19 patient, particularly in severe patients. Common symptoms included fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue are frequent in eosinopenia patients. Eosinopenia may represent a novel phenotype in COVID-19, which needs further investigation.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yusheng Cheng","author_inst":"Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhou","author_inst":"Second People Hospital of Wuhu"},{"author_name":"Mengde Zhu","author_inst":"First People Hospital of Hefei"},{"author_name":"Lei Zha","author_inst":"Infection and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Zhiwei Lu","author_inst":"Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhen Ding","author_inst":"First People Hospital of Hefei"},{"author_name":"Jianghua Yang","author_inst":"Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Gang Yang","author_inst":"Second People Hospital of Wuhu"},{"author_name":"Peter Cheung","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuhui Huang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manon Wider","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Portmann","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Tran Thi Nhu Thao","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rune Hartmann","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Vincent Gardeux","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Alpern","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bart Deplancke","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20075416","rel_title":"Estimating Survival of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients from Admission Information","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20075416","rel_abs":"Background: Chinese studies reported predictors of severe disease and mortality associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A generalizable and simple survival calculator based on data from US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has not yet been introduced. Objective: Develop and validate a clinical tool to predict 7-day survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective and prospective cohort study. Setting: Thirteen acute care hospitals in the New York City area. Participants: Adult patients hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The development and internal validation cohort included patients hospitalized between March 1 and May 6, 2020. The external validation cohort included patients hospitalized between March 1 and May 5, 2020. Measurements: Demographic, laboratory, clinical, and outcome data were extracted from the electronic health record. Optimal predictors and performance were identified using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with receiver operating characteristic curves and measurements of area under the curve (AUC). Results: The development and internal validation cohort included 11 095 patients with a median age of 65 years [interquartile range (IQR) 54-77]. Overall 7-day survival was 89%. Serum blood urea nitrogen, age, absolute neutrophil count, red cell distribution width, oxygen saturation, and serum sodium were identified as the 6 optimal of 42 possible predictors of survival. These factors constitute the NOCOS (Northwell COVID-19 Survival) Calculator. Performance in the internal validation, prospective validation, and external validation were marked by AUCs of 0.86, 0.82, and 0.82, respectively. Limitations: All participants were hospitalized within the New York City area. Conclusions: The NOCOS Calculator uses 6 factors routinely available at hospital admission to predict 7-day survival for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The calculator is publicly available at https:\/\/feinstein.northwell.edu\/NOCOS.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Todd J.

Methods: This study leverages publicly available data to learn patterns of dynamic changes in the reproduction rate for sixteen countries covering Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Africa. Furthermore, we model the relationships between the cumulative number of cases and the dynamic reproduction rate to characterize the effectiveness of the NPIs. We learn four levels of NPIs according to their effects in the control of COVID-19 growth and categorize the 16 countries into the corresponding groups. Results: The dynamic changes of the reproduction rate are learned via linear regression models for all of the studied countries, with the average adjusted R-squared at 0.96 and the 95% confidence interval as [0.94 0.98]. China, South Korea, Argentina, and Australia are at the first level of NPIs, which are the most effective. Japan and Egypt are at the second level of NPIs, and Italy, Germany, France, Netherlands, and Spain, are at the third level. The US and UK have the most inefficient NPIs, and they are at the fourth level of NPIs. Conclusions: COVID-19 case growth data provides evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NPIs.

Methods: We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM\/IgG antibody for SARS-CoV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM\/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission. Findings: Of the 139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8%, 48.0%, and 95.8% of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3%, 8.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22\/38) and 68.4% (26\/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3% (55\/74) and 82.4% (61\/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively. Conclusion: The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kazuo Imai","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sakiko Tabata","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayu Ikeda","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sakiko Noguchi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yutaro Kitagawa","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Masaru Matuoka","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kazuyasu Miyoshi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Norihito Tarumoto","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Sakai","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Toshimitsu Ito","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shigefumi Maesaki","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Takuya Maeda","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rune Hartmann","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Vincent Gardeux","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Alpern","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bart Deplancke","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20076281","rel_title":"Nowcasting and Forecasting the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20076281","rel_abs":"Introduction: As of early December 2019, COVID-19, a disease induced by SARS-COV-2, has started spreading, originated in Wuhan, China, and now on, have infected more than 2 million individuals throughout the world. Purpose: This study aimed to nowcast the COVID-19 outbreak throughout Iran and to forecast the trends of the disease spreading in the upcoming month. Methods: The cumulative incidence and fatality data were extracted from official reports of the National Ministry of Health and Medical Educations of Iran. To formulate the outbreak dynamics, six phenomenological models, as well as a modified mechanistic Susciptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, were implemented. The models were calibrated with the integrated data, and trends of the epidemic in Iran was then forecasted for the next month. Results: The final outbreak size calculated by the best fitted phenomenological models was estimated to be in the range of 68,486 to 118,923 cases; however, the calibrated SEIR model estimated that the outbreak would rage again, starting from April 26. Moreover, projected by the mechanistic model, approximately half of the infections have undergone undetected. Conclusion: Although the advanced phenomenological models perfectly fitted the data, they are incapable of applying behavioral aspects of the outbreak and hence, are not reliable enough for authorities' decision adoptions. In contrast, the mechanistic SEIR model alarms that the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran may peak for the second time, consequent to lifting the control measures. This implies that the government may implement a more granular decision making to control the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hamidreza Masjedi","author_inst":"Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Fatemeh Bahranizadd","author_inst":"Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Hosein Zare","author_inst":"Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Yutaro Kitagawa","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Masaru Matuoka","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kazuyasu Miyoshi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Norihito Tarumoto","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Sakai","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Toshimitsu Ito","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shigefumi Maesaki","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Takuya Maeda","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rune Hartmann","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Vincent Gardeux","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Alpern","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bart Deplancke","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20075796","rel_title":"COVID-19 serial interval estimates based on confirmed cases in public reports from 86 Chinese cities","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20075796","rel_abs":"As a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread widely and claim lives worldwide, its transmission characteristics remain uncertain.

For U.S. states, weather variables show opposite effects when compared to the case of countries: higher temperature or absolute humidity imply faster early outbreak. The higher the population density or the earlier the date when state reached 100th case, the faster the pace of outbreak. When all variables are considered, only population density and the timeline variable show statistical significance. Discounting the effect of the timeline variable, we obtain an estimate for the initial growth rate of Covid-19, which can be also used to estimate the basic reproduction number for a region, in terms of population density. This has policy implications regarding how to control the pace of Covid-10 outbreak in a particular area, and we discuss some of them. In the case of countries, for which we did not have demographic information, weather variables lose statistical significance once the timeline variable is added. Relaxing CI requirements, absolute humidity contributes mildly to the reduction of growth rate of cases for the countries studied. Our results suggest that population density should be employed as a control variable and that analysis should have a local character, for subregions and countries separately, in studies involving the dynamics of Covid-19 and similar infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renato H.L.

DESIGN Retrospective, observational case series. SETTING Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital PARTICIPANTS Thirty-three patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to hospital. Data were collected from January 27 to April 10, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Throat swabs, sputum, stool, and blood samples were collected, and viral load was measured by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Specific IgM and IgG against spike protein (S), spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) were analyzed. RESULTS At the early stages of symptom onset, SARS-CoV-2 viral load is higher in throat swabs and sputum, but lower in stool. The median (IQR) time of undetectable viral RNA in throat swab, sputum, and stool was 18.5 (13.25-22) days, 22 (18.5-27.5) days, and 17 (11.5-32) days, respectively. In sputum, 17 patients (51.5%) had undetectable viral RNA within 22 days (short persistence), and 16 (48.5%) had persistent viral RNA more than 22 days (long persistence). Three patients (9.1%) had a detectable relapse of viral RNA in sputum within two weeks of their discharge from the hospital. One patient had persistent viral RNA for 59 days or longer. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgM, anti-RBD IgM, and anti-N IgM was 10.5 (7.75-15.5) days, 14 (9-24) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and anti-N IgG was 10 (7.25-16.5) days, 13 (9-17) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. By week 8 after symptom onset, IgM were negative in many of the previously positive patients, and IgG levels remained less than 50% of the peak levels in more than 20% of the patients. In about 40% of the patients, anti-RBD IgG levels were 4-times higher in convalescence than in acute phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA coexisted with antibodies for more than 50 days. Anti-RBD IgM and IgG levels, including anti-RBD IgM levels at presentation and peak time, were significantly higher in viral RNA short persistence patients than in long persistence patients. CONCLUSION This study adds important new information about the features of viral load and antibody dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. It is clear from these results that the viral RNA persists in sputum and stool specimens for a relatively long time in many patients. Anti-RBD may also serve as a potential protective antibody against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as viral persistence appears to be related to anti-RBD levels. Earlier treatment intervention also appears to be a factor in viral persistence.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianping Huang","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University,  Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tingting Mao","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shufei Li","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lianpeng Wu","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Xu","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huanzheng Li","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chenyang xu","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feifei Su","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou  Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianyi Dai","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jichan Shi","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Cai","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chongquan Huang","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuan Lin","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dong Chen","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Lin","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baochang Sun","author_inst":"Wenzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shaohua Tang","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Alpern","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bart Deplancke","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20076190","rel_title":"Characterization of clinical progression of COVID-19 patients in Shenzhen, China","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20076190","rel_abs":"Background: Understanding clinical progression of COVID-19 is a key public health priority that informs resource allocation during an emergency. We characterized clinical progression of COVID-19 and determined important predictors for faster clinical progression to key clinical events and longer use of medical resources. Methods and Findings: The study is a single-center, observational study with prospectively collected data from all 420 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized in Shenzhen between January 11th and March 10th, 2020 regardless of clinical severity. Using competing risk regressions according to the methods of Fine and Gray, we found that males had faster clinical progression than females in the older age group and the difference could not be explained by difference in baseline conditions or smoking history. We estimated the proportion of cases in each severity stage over 80 days following symptom onset using a nonparametric method built upon estimated cumulative incidence of key clinical events. Based on random survival forest models, we stratified cases into risk sets with very different clinical trajectories. Those who progressed to the severe stage (22%,93\/420), developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (9%,39\/420), and were admitted to the intensive care unit (5%,19\/420) progressed on average 9.5 days (95%CI 8.7,10.3), 11.0 days (95%CI 9.7,12.3), and 10.5 days (95%CI 8.2,13.3), respectively, after symptom onset. We estimated that patients who were admitted to ICUs remained there for an average of 34.4 days (95%CI 24.1,43.2). The median length of hospital stay was 21.3 days (95%CI, 20.5,22.2) for cases who did not progress to the severe stage, but increased to 52.1 days (95%CI, 43.3,59.5) for those who required critical care. Conclusions: Our analyses provide insights into clinical progression of cases starting early in the course of infection. Patient characteristics near symptom onset both with and without lab parameters have tremendous potential for predicting clinical progression and informing strategic response.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qifang Bi","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Chengcheng Hong","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Meng","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Zhenke Wu","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Michigan Institute for Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"},{"author_name":"Pengzheng Zhou","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Chenfei Ye","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Sun","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Lauren M Kucirka","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiancong Chen","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie K Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Daniel Alpern","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bart Deplancke","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
