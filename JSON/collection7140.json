Method: Twenty commonly available fabrics and materials were evaluated for their ability to reduce air concentrations of ultrafine particles at a face velocity of 16.5 m\/s. Further assessment was made on the filtration ability of select fabrics while damp and of fabric combinations which might be used to construct homemade masks. Results: Single fabric layers blocked a range of ultrafine particles. When fabrics were layered, significantly more ultrafine particles were filtered. Nonwoven fusible interfacing significantly increased filtration. Conclusions: The current coronavirus pandemic has left many communities without access N95 facemasks. Our findings suggest that face masks made from layered common fabric can help filter ultrafine particles and provide some protection for the wearer when commercial facemasks are unavailable.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eugenia O'Kelly","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Sophia Pirog","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"James Ward","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"P John Clarkson","author_inst":"Cambridge University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065607","rel_title":"Applying the SEIR Model in Forecasting The COVID-19 Trend in Malaysia: A Preliminary Study","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065607","rel_abs":"On March 18, 2020 the Malaysian government implemented a 14-day Movement Control Order (MCO) as part of the mitigation plan in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic in the country.

A rapidly progressing epidemic of COVID-19 ensued within China, with multiple exportations to other countries. We aimed to measure perceptions and responses towards COVID-19 in three countries to understand how population-level anxiety can be mitigated in the early phases of a pandemic. Methods Between February and March 2020, we conducted online surveys in Singapore, China and Italy with a total of 4,505 respondents to measure knowledge, perceptions, anxiety and behaviours towards the COVID-19 epidemic, and identified factors associated with lower anxiety and more positive behavioural responses. Findings Respondents reported high awareness of COVID-19 and its accompanying symptoms, comparable information seeking habits and similarly high levels of information sufficiency, adherence to and acceptance of public health control measures. Higher self-efficacy was associated with lower anxiety levels in all three countries, while willingness to comply with restrictive measures and greater information sufficiency were associated with more positive behavioural changes to reduce spread of infection. Interpretation Population-level anxiety and behavioural responses to an outbreak can be influenced by information provided. This should be used to inform future outbreak preparedness plans, taking into account the importance of increasing population-level self-efficacy and information sufficiency to reduce anxiety and promote positive behavioural changes.

This study aims to identify and evaluate the forms of supportive care for patients with respiratory diseases. Methods: An umbrella review of supportive care for patient respiratory diseases was undertaken. We comprehensively searched the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang Data and CBM (SinoMed) from their inception to 31 March 2020, and other sources to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to supportive treatments for patient with respiratory diseases including COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. We assessed the methodological quality using the AMSTAR score and the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of each included systematic review and meta-analysis. Results: We included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this study. Most studies focused on the respiratory and circulatory support. Ten studies were of high methodological quality, five studies of medium quality, and three studies of low quality. According to four studies extracorporeal membrane oxygenation did not reduce mortality in adults (OR\/RR ranging from 0.71 to 1.28), but two studies reported significantly lower mortality in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than in the control group (OR\/RR ranging from 0.38 to 0.73). Besides, monitoring of vital signs and increasing the number of medical staff may also reduce the mortality in patients with respiratory diseases. Conclusions: Our overview suggests that supportive care may reduce the mortality of patients with respiratory diseases to some extent. However, the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes in the included studies was low to moderate. Further systematic reviews and meta-analyses are needed to address the evidence gap regarding the supportive care for SARS, MERS and COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xufei Luo Sr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Meng Lv Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Wang Jr.","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Long Jr.","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mengjuan Ren Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xianzhuo Zhang Sr.","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yunlan Liu Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li Sr.","author_inst":"Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou Jr.","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma Jr.","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka Sr.","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn Jr.","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee Sr.","author_inst":"Korea Cochrane Centre, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen Sr.","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065094","rel_title":"Rapid Open Development and Clinical Validation of Multiple New 3D-Printed Nasopharyngeal Swabs in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065094","rel_abs":"Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a severe international shortage of the nasopharyngeal swabs that are required for collection of optimal specimens, creating a critical bottleneck in the way of high-sensitivity virological testing for COVID-19. To address this crisis, we designed and executed an innovative, radically cooperative, rapid-response translational-research program that brought together healthcare workers, manufacturers, and scientists to emergently develop and clinically validate new swabs for immediate mass production by 3D printing. We performed a rigorous multi-step preclinical evaluation on 160 swab designs and 48 materials from 24 companies, laboratories, and individuals, and shared results and other feedback via a public data repository (http:\/\/github.com\/rarnaout\/Covidswab\/). We validated four prototypes through an institutional review board (IRB)-approved clinical trial that involved 276 outpatient volunteers who presented to our hospital's drive-through testing center with symptoms suspicious for COVID-19. Each participant was swabbed with a reference swab (the control) and a prototype, and SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were compared. All prototypes displayed excellent concordance with the control ({kappa}=0.85-0.89). Cycle-threshold (Ct) values were not significantly different between each prototype and the control, supporting the new swabs' non-inferiority (Mann-Whitney U [MWU] p>0.05). Study staff preferred one of the prototypes over the others and the control swab overall. The total time elapsed between identification of the problem and validation of the first prototype was 22 days. The swabs are available to order (http:\/\/printedswabs.org). Our experience holds lessons for the rapid development, validation, and deployment of new technology for this pandemic and beyond.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cody J Callahan","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rose Lee","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kate Zulauf","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Lauren Tamburello","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Keneth P Smith","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Joe Previtera","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Annie Cheng","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alex Green","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Havard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Abdul Azim","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amanda Yano","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nancy Doraiswami","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Kirby","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ramy Arnaout","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen Sr.","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064808","rel_title":"Coronavirus PPE: a positive pressure hood assembled from ubiquitous,low-cost materials","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064808","rel_abs":"A positive pressure protective hood system was purposefully constructed only from materials commonly found worldwide, including bendable aluminum mesh, elastic head straps, velcro tape, a plastic sheet, a furnace filter and two computer central processing unit (CPU) cooling fans. The practical advantages of this system are that the materials are readily available in the inventories of most electronics and hardware outlets, ease of assembly (particularly if choosing to employ 3D printing for the fan enclosure and\/or making several units at once with a defined workflow), and high probability of the materials being available in current or prospective personal protective equipment (PPE)-deplete regions. An experiment with identical fire detectors showed adequate inner isolation of the hood prototype from paper combustion particulates, which have a size range slightly smaller than putative coronavirus aerosols, for at least 90 seconds. The theoretical advantages of this system include significant reduction in healthcare provider exposure to coronavirus-containing respiratory fomites, respiratory droplets and aerosols (vs. traditional static masks and shields) during high risk procedures such as endotracheal intubation or routine care of an upright and coughing patient. Additionally, the assembly eliminates contact exposure to coronavirus fomites due to whole-head coverage from a hood system.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark A Crawford","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Rose Lee","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kate Zulauf","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Lauren Tamburello","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Keneth P Smith","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Joe Previtera","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Annie Cheng","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alex Green","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Havard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Abdul Azim","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amanda Yano","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nancy Doraiswami","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Kirby","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ramy Arnaout","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen Sr.","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20066068","rel_title":"The socio-economic determinants of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20066068","rel_abs":"The magnitude of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has an enormous impact on the social life and the economic activities in almost every country in the world.

As with any public health emergency, a major component of the global response is timely, effective science. However, particular factors specific to COVID-19 must be overcome to ensure that research efforts are optimised. We aimed to model the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical academic response in the UK, and to provide recommendations for COVID-related research. Methods: We constructed a simple stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in the UK in four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: Italy model (6%), mitigation (10%), relaxed mitigation (40%) and do-nothing (80%) scenarios. The ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate is affected by the following key factors: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics). Findings: In Italy model, mitigation, relaxed mitigation and do-nothing scenarios, from 5 March 2020 the duration (days) and peak infection rates (%) are 95(2.4%), 115(2.5%), 240(5.3%) and 240(16.7%) respectively. Near complete attrition of academia (87% reduction, less than 400 clinical academics) occurs 35 days after pandemic start for 11, 34, 62, 76 days respectively, with no clinical academics at all for 37 days in the do-nothing scenario. Restoration of normal academic workforce (80% of normal capacity) takes 11,12, 30 and 26 weeks respectively. Interpretation: Pandemic COVID-19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt. We highlight six key strategies: radical prioritisation (eg 3-4 research ideas per institution), deep resourcing, non-standard leadership (repurposing of key non-frontline teams), rationalisation (profoundly simple approaches), careful site selection (eg protected sites with large academic backup) and complete suspension of academic competition with collaborative approaches.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Michail Katsoulis","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Alvina G Lai","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura Pasea","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Thomas A Treibel","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Manisty","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Quarta","author_inst":"Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Joao Cavalcante","author_inst":"Minneapolis Heart Institute, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The model provides plots of staff availability over time using either a constant infection rate, or a changing infection rate fitted to population-based infection curves. It allows users to gauge the extent and timing of dips in staff availability. The basic constant infection rate model is available within an on-line web application (https:\/\/covid19.shef.ac.uk).

Clinicians need a more accurate understanding of the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19. Methods: We searched studies reporting clinical characteristics in children with COVID-19 published until March 31, 2020. We screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the risk of bias and quality of evidence of the included studies. We combined some of the outcomes (symptoms) in a single-arm meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Results: Our search retrieved 49 studies, including 25 case reports, 23 case series and one cohort study, with a total of 1667 patients. Our meta-analysis showed that most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms. Eighty-three percent of the children were within family clusters of cases, and 19% had no symptoms. At least 7% with digestive symptoms. The main symptoms of children were fever (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 39%, 56%) and cough (39%, 95% CI: 30%, 48%). The lymphocyte count was below normal level in only 15% [95% CI: 8%, 22%] of children which is different from adult patients. 66% [95% CI: 55%, 77%] of children had abnormal findings in CT imaging. Conclusions: Most children with COVID-19 have only mild symptoms, and many children are asymptomatic. Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in children. Vomiting and diarrhea were not common in children. The lymphocyte count is usually within the normal range in children.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Chenglin Wang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Qianling Shi","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Shuya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Yangqin Xun","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Muna Baskota","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yinmei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhai","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20064436","rel_title":"Potential Effectiveness and Safety of Antiviral Agents in Children with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20064436","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak presents a new, life-threatening disease. Our aim was to assess the potential effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for COVID-19 in children. Methods: Electronic databases from their inception to March, 31 2020 were searched for randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials and cohort studies of interventions with antiviral agents for children (less than 18 years of age) with COVID-19. Results: A total of 23 studies of indirect evidence with 6008 patients were included. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate to high in general. The effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 is uncertain: For adults with COVID-19, lopinavir\/ritonavir had no effect on mortality (risk ratio [RR]= 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 1.30) and probability of negative PCR test (RR=0.98, 95 CI% 0.82 to 1.18). Arbidol had no benefit on probability of negative PCR test (RR=1.27, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.73). Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with increasing the probability of negative PCR result (RR=0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18). For adults with SARS, interferon was associated with reduced corticosteroid dose (weighted mean difference [WMD]=-0.14 g, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.07) but had no effect on mortality (RR=0.72, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.88); ribavirin did not reduce mortality (RR=0.68, 95% CI % 0.43 to 1.06) and was associated with high risk of severe adverse reactions; and oseltamivir had no effect on mortality (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.38). Ribavirin combined with interferon was also not effective in adults with MERS and associated with adverse reactions. Conclusions: There is no evidence showing the effectiveness of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19, and the clinical efficacy of existing antiviral agents is still uncertain. We do not suggest clinical routine use of antivirals for COVID-19 in children, with the exception of clinical trials.

Since, then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an explosion of cases due to local cluster transmissions. METHODS We estimated growth rate and doubling time of SARS-CoV-2 for India and high burden states using crowd sourced time series data. Further, we also estimated Basic Reproductive Number (R0) and time dependent reproductive number (Rt) using serial intervals from the data. We compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in analysis. We modified standard SIR models to SIRD model to accommodate deaths using R0 with the Sequential Bayesian method (SBM) for simulation in SIRD models. RESULTS On an average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was 3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time to recovery was 14, SD 5.3 days. Daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95%CI; 0.14, 0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95%CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will be around mid-July to early August 2020 with around 12.5% likely to be infected at peak time of incidence. CONCLUSIONS The pattern of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India is suggestive of community transmission. There is a need to increase fund for infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies. All the current gains may be reversed rapidly if air travel and social mixing resumes rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner, and should be back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccine or a medicine.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aravind Lathika Rajendrakumar","author_inst":"University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Anand Thakarakkattil Narayanan Nair","author_inst":"University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Charvi Nangia","author_inst":"University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Prabal Kumar Chourasia","author_inst":"Mary Washington Hospital, Fredericksburg WV, USA"},{"author_name":"Mehul Kumar Chourasia","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ghouse Syed","author_inst":"University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Anu Sasidharan Nair","author_inst":"Health System Research India Initiative, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Arun B Nair","author_inst":"Health System Research India Initiative"},{"author_name":"Muhammed Shaffi Fazaludeen Koya","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Boston University, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Che","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Qubei Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065524","rel_title":"Investigating spatial variability in COVID-19 pandemic severity across 19 geographic areas, Spain, 2020","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065524","rel_abs":"Introduction: Spain has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, ranking fifth in the world in terms of both total cases and total deaths due to COVID-19 as of May 20, 2020. Here we derived estimates of pandemic severity and assessed its relationship with socio-demographic and healthcare factors. Methods: We retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Spain from February 20, 2020 to May 20, 2020. We used statistical methods to estimate the time-delay adjusted case fatality risk (aCFR) for 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities of Spain. We then assessed how transmission and sociodemographic variables were associated with the aCFR across areas using multivariate regression analysis. Results: We estimated the highest aCFR for Madrid (25.9%) and the average aCFR in Spain (18.2%). Our multivariate regression analysis revealed three statistically significant predictor variables: population size, population density, and the unemployment rate. Conclusions: The estimated aCFR for 10 autonomous communities\/cities in Spain are significantly higher than those previously estimated for other geographic regions including China and Korea. Our results suggest that public health interventions focused on densely populated areas and low socioeconomic groups can ameliorate the mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sushma Dahal","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Mizumoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Richard Rothenberg","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mehul Kumar Chourasia","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ghouse Syed","author_inst":"University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Anu Sasidharan Nair","author_inst":"Health System Research India Initiative, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Arun B Nair","author_inst":"Health System Research India Initiative"},{"author_name":"Muhammed Shaffi Fazaludeen Koya","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Boston University, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Che","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Qubei Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065664","rel_title":"Application of Telemedicine During the Coronavirus Disease Epidemics: A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065664","rel_abs":"Background: As COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, early prevention and control of the epidemic is extremely important. Telemedicine, which includes medical advice given over telephone, Internet, mobile phone applications or other similar ways, may be an efficient way to reduce transmission and pressure on medical institutions. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases for literature on the use of telemedicine for COVID-19, SARS and MERS. from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We included studies about the content of the consultation (such as symptoms, therapy and prevention, policy, public service), screening of suspected cases, the provision of advice given to those people who may have symptoms or contact history. We conducted meta-analyses on the main outcomes of the studies. Results: A total of 2041 articles were identified after removing duplicates. After reading the full texts, we finally included nine studies. People were most concerned about symptoms (64.2%), epidemic situation and public problems (14.5%), and psychological problems (10.3%) during COVID-19 epidemic. During the SARS epidemic, the proportions of people asking for consultation for symptoms, prevention and therapy, and psychological problems were 35.0%, 22.0%, and 23.0%, respectively. Two studies demonstrated that telemedicine can be used to screen the suspected patients and give advice. One study emphasized the limited possibilities to follow up people calling hotlines and difficulties in identifying all suspect cases. Conclusions: Telemedicine services should focus on the issues that the public is most concerned about, such as then symptoms, prevention and treatment of the disease, and provide reasonable advice to patients with symptoms or people with epidemic history.

As of April 10, 2020 half COVID-19 deaths in Canada had occurred in LTC. We sought to better understand trends and risk factors for COVID-19 death in LTC in Ontario. Methods: We analyzed a COVID-19 outbreak database created by the Ontario Ministry of Health, for the period March 29-April 7, 2020. Mortality incidence rate ratios for LTC were calculated with community living Ontarians aged > 69 used as the comparator group. Count-based regression methods were used to model temporal trends and identify associations between infection risk in staff and residents, and subsequent LTC resident death. Results: Confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 were identified in 272\/627 LTC by April 7, 2020. The incidence rate ratio for COVID-19 death was 13.1 (9.9-17.3) relative to community living adults over 69. Incidence rate ratio increased over time and was 87.28 (90% CrI 9.98 to 557.08) by April 7, 2020. Lagged infection in staff was a strong predictor of death in residents (e.g., adjusted IRR for death per infected staff member 1.17, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.26 at a 6-day lag). Interpretation: Mortality risk in elders in Ontario is currently concentrated in LTC, and this risk has increased sharply over a short period of time. Early identification of risk requires a focus on testing and provision of personal protective equipment to staff, and restructuring the LTC workforce to prevent movement of COVID-19 between LTC.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Lauren Lapointe-Shaw","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Janine McCready","author_inst":"Michael Garron Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ashleigh Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Qianling Shi","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine,Lanzhou University,Lanzhou 730000,China"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Shuya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science a"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center,School of Basic Medical Sciences,Lanzhou University,Lanzhou 730000,China"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University,Chongqing 400014,China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Chang Shu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Daiyin Tian","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065771","rel_title":"A systematic review of antibody mediated immunity to coronaviruses: antibody kinetics, correlates of protection, and association of antibody responses with severity of disease","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065771","rel_abs":"The duration and nature of immunity generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and human endemic coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence.

Random-effects results demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 in non-severe group had lower levels for CRP (WMD = -41.78 mg\/l, 95% CI = [-52.43, -31.13], P < 0.001), PCT (WMD = -0.13 ng\/ml, 95% CI = [-0.20, -0.05], P < 0.001), IL-6 (WMD = -21.32 ng\/l, 95% CI = [-28.34, -14.31], P < 0.001), ESR (WMD = -8.40 mm\/h, 95% CI = [-14.32, -2.48], P = 0.005), SAA (WMD = -43.35 g\/ml, 95% CI = [-80.85, -5.85], P = 0.020) and serum ferritin (WMD = -398.80 mg\/l, 95% CI = [-625.89, -171.71], P < 0.001), compared with those in severe group. Moreover, survivors had lower level for IL-6 than non-survivors with COVID-19 (WMD = -4.80 ng\/ml, 95% CI = [-5.87, -3.73], P < 0.001). These results were consistent through sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment. Conclusions: The meta-analysis highlights the association of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19. Measurement of inflammatory markers might help clinicians to monitor and evaluate the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Furong Zeng","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital,Central South University"},{"author_name":"Ying Guo","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingzhu Yin","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiang Chen","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Guangtong Deng","author_inst":"Xiangya hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Susan M Rattigan","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Brooke Borgert","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Carlos Moreno","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Benjamin D.

The current global standard used in diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Although the RT-PCR remains the standard reference for diagnosis purposes, it is a time-consuming and expensive test, and moreover, it usually suffers from high rates of false-negatives. Several early works have reported that the sensitivity of the chest Computed Tomography (CT) and the chest X-ray imaging are noticeably greater than that of the RT-PCR test at the initial representations of the disease, making them great candidates for developing new and sophisticated methodologies for analysis and classification of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we establish the use of a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective X-ray-based method as a key diagnosis and screening tool for COVID-19 at early and intermediate stages of the disease. To this end, we develop a novel and sophisticated deep learning-based signal and image processing technique as well as classification methodology for analyzing X-ray images specific to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, we consider a semi-supervised learning methodology based on AutoEncoders to first extract the infected legions in chest X-ray manifestation of COVID-19 and other Pneumonia-like diseases (as well as healthy cases). Then, we utilize this highly-tailored deep architecture to extract the relevant features specific to each class (i.e., healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, and COVID-19) and train a powerful yet efficient classifier to perform the task of automatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the semi-supervised nature of the proposed framework enables us to efficiently exploit the limited available dataset on COVID-19 while exploiting the vast amount of available X-ray dataset for healthy and non-COVID classes. Moreover, such a semi-supervised approach does not require an expert-annotated lesion area for each class. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for COVID-19 identification while employing approximately ten times fewer training parameters as compared to other existing methodologies for classification of the COVID-19 from X-ray images (facilitating efficient training in a limited data regime). We further develop explainable artificial intelligence tools that can explain the diagnosis by using attribution maps while providing an indispensable tool for the radiologist in triage state. We have made the codes of our proposed framework publicly available to the research and healthcare community.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shahin Khobahi","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Chirag Agarwal","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mojtaba Soltanalian","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Xiang Chen","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Guangtong Deng","author_inst":"Xiangya hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Susan M Rattigan","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Brooke Borgert","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Carlos Moreno","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Benjamin D.

As patients potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 need to visit hospitals, the incidence of nosocomial infection can be expected to be high. Therefore, a comprehensive and objective understanding of nosocomial infection is needed to guide the prevention and control of the epidemic. Methods: We searched major international and Chinese databases Medicine, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM(China Biology Medicine disc), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang database)) for case series or case reports on nosocomial infections of COVID-19, SARS(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes) and MERS(Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We conducted a meta-analysis of the proportion of nosocomial infection patients in the diagnosed patients, occupational distribution of nosocomial infection medical staff and other indicators. Results: We included 40 studies. Among the confirmed patients, the proportions of nosocomial infections were 44.0%, 36.0% and 56.0% for COVID-19, SARS and MERS, respectively. Of the confirmed patients, the medical staff and other hospital-acquired infections accounted for 33.0% and 2.0% of COVID-19 cases, 37.0% and 24.0% of SARS cases, and 19.0% and 36.0% of MERS cases, respectively. Nurses and doctors were the most affected among the infected medical staff. The mean numbers of secondary cases caused by one index patient were 29.3 and 6.3 for SARS and MERS, respectively. Conclusions: The proportion of nosocomial infection in patients with COVID-19 was 44%. Patients attending hospitals should take personal protection. Medical staff should be awareness of the disease to protect themselves and the patients.

The simple General epidemic model is then fitted, and time calibration to calendar time is done using the observed number of case fatalities, together with estimates of the time between infection to death and the infection fatality risk. Finally, predictions are made assuming no change of behaviour, as well as for the situation where preventive measures are put in place at one specific time-point. The overall effect of the preventive measures is assumed to be known, or else estimated from the observed increased doubling time after preventive measures are put in place. The predictions are highly sensitive to the doubling times without and with preventive measures, sensitive to R0, but less sensitive to the estimates used for time-calibration: observed number of case fatalities, typical time between infection and death, and the infection fatality risk. The method is applied to the urban area of Stockholm, and predictions show that the peak of infections appear in mid-April and infections start settling in May.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Britton","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Juan P Torres","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Miguel ORyan","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Olivares","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Pablo Gallardo","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Carolina Salas","author_inst":"Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna"},{"author_name":"Xianzhuo Zhang","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Shuya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science a"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qianling Shi","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20067348","rel_title":"Massive and rapid COVID-19 testing is feasible by extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20067348","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The most widely used method of COVID-19 diagnostics is a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient samples, typically from nasopharyngeal swabs. RNA extraction is a major bottleneck in current COVID-19 testing, in terms of turn-around, logistics, component availability and cost, which delays or completely precludes COVID-19 diagnostics in many settings. Efforts to simplify the current methods are critical, as increased diagnostic availability and efficiency would benefit patient care and infection control. Here, we describe methods to circumvent RNA extraction in COVID-19 testing by performing RT-PCR directly on heat-inactivated subject samples as well as samples lysed with readily available detergents. Our data, including benchmarking with 597 clinically diagnosed patient samples against a standardised and sensitive diagnostic system, show that direct RT-PCR is a viable option to extraction-based COVID-19 diagnostics. Furthermore, using controlled amounts of active SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated performance of generic buffers as sample medium for the direct RT-PCR assay, identifying several suitable formulations. We also confirmed the effectiveness of heat inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by plaque assay. Significant savings in terms of time and cost can be achieved by embracing RNA-extraction-free protocols, that feed directly into the established PCR-based testing pipeline. This could aid the expansion of COVID-19 testing.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioanna Smyrlaki","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Martin Ekman","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Lentini","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Nuno Rufino de Sousa","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Natali Papanicoloau","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064501","rel_title":"What influences COVID-19 infection rates: A statistical approach to identify promising factors applied to infection data from Germany","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064501","rel_abs":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic is of big and world-wide concern. There is an intense discussion and uncertainty which factors and sanctions can reduce infection rates. The overall aim is to prevent an overload of the medical system. Even within one country, there is frequently a strong local variability in both -- political sanctions as well as other local factors -- which may influence infection rates. The main focus of study is analysis and interpretation of recent temporal developments (infection rates). We present a statistical framework designed to identify local factors which reduce infection rates. The approach is robust with respect to the number of undetected infection cases. We apply the framework to spatio-temporal infection data from Germany. In particular, we demonstrate that (1) infection rates are in average significantly decreasing in Germany; (2) there is a high spatial variability of these rates, and (3) both, early emergence of first infections and high local infection densities has led to strong recent decays in infection rates, suggesting that psychological effects (such as awareness of danger) lead to behaviour changes that reduce infection rates. However, the full potential of the presented method cannot yet be exploited, since more precise spatio-temporal data, such as local cell phone-based mobility data, are not yet available.

Few countries have tracking and testing procedures that are sufficiently robust to discover nearly all infections. In most countries they are inadequate, hence the true extent of the pandemic is unknown. The current study proposes the estimate of the COVID-19 extent for countries with sufficiently high number of deaths and cases. The estimate is based on a simple model of mortality. This model was developed for a reference country with a large number of cases and high intensity of COVID-19 testing. The model is then applied to compute apparent mortality in the target and reference countries. The number of cases in the target country is then estimated assuming constant underlying true mortality. The estimate of cases in most countries is significantly higher than the official record. As of April 12, 2020, the global estimate is 5.2 million compared to 1.8 million in the official record. The models developed in this study are available at covid-model.net. The model ignores several factors that are known to influence mortality, such as the demographics and health condition of population, state of epidemic and sociological differences between countries. While the model is rough, it nevertheless provides a unified approach to producing a systematic global estimate of the extent of the COVID-19 epidemic and can be useful for its monitoring.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Witold R Rudnicki","author_inst":"University of Bia\u0142ystok"},{"author_name":"Rados\u0142aw Piliszek","author_inst":"University of Bia\u0142ystok"},{"author_name":"Dennis Wilken","author_inst":"Institute of Geosciences, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nuno Rufino de Sousa","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Natali Papanicoloau","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064824","rel_title":"Estimating the last day for COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064824","rel_abs":"Our main aim is to estimate the end of the first wave epidemic of COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China.

On March 11, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The first instance of the virus in Nigeria was documented on February 27, 2020. Methods This study provides a preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria quantifying. We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector) and adjusted for disease importation. Findings By April 11, 2020, 318 confirmed cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria. At day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.05-0.10) with doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28 - 15.18). Separately for travel related and local cases the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using three-weekly window while adjusting for travel related cases. The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65 -8.41) at day 22 (March 19, 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% CrI: 3.83 -7.88) at day 25 (March 22, 2020). The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value at April 11, 2020 was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.26 - 1.58). Interpretation These 45-day estimates suggested that cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria have been remarkably lower than expected and the preparedness to detect needs to be shifted to stop local transmission.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oyelola Adegboye","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Adeshina I Adekunle","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Ezra Gayawan","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Nuno Rufino de Sousa","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Natali Papanicoloau","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065128","rel_title":"Refined compartmental models, asymptomatic carriers and COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065128","rel_abs":"The goal of this article is to analyze some compartmental models specially designed to model the spread of a disease whose transmission has the same features as COVID-19.

However, in resource-constrained countries such as the Philippines, test kits have limited availability. As of 12 April 2020, there are 11 testing centers in the country that have been accredited by the Department of Health (DOH) to conduct testing. In this paper, we determine the optimal percentage allocation of COVID-19 test kits among accredited testing centers in the Philippines that gives an equitable chance to all infected individuals to be tested. Heterogeneity in testing accessibility, population density of municipalities, and the capacity of testing facilities are included in the model. Our results showed that the range of optimal allocation per testing center are: Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (4.17%-6.34%), San Lazaro Hospital (14.65%-24.03%), University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health (16.25%-44.80%), Lung Center of the Philippines (15.8%-26.40%), Baguio General Hospital Medical Center (0.58%-0.76%), The Medical City, Pasig City (5.96%-25.51%), St. Luke's Medical Center, Quezon City (1.09%-6.70%), Bicol Public Health Laboratory (0.06%-0.08%), Western Visayas Medical Center (0.71%-4.52%), Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (1.02%-2.61%), and Southern Philippines Medical Center (approx 0.01%). If there will be changes in the number of testing centers, our model can still be used to modify the test kit allocation. Our results can serve as a guide to the authorities in distributing the COVID-19 test kits. These can also be used to determine the capacity of testing centers and the effects of increasing its number. The model can also be used for proposing additional number and location of new testing centers.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Alvin H Buhat","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jessa Camille C Duero","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Edd Francis O Felix","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Mamplata","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065227","rel_title":"Model calibration, nowcasting, and operational prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065227","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has already caused huge human and economic cost, and will likely continue to do so for some time. Accurate and timely forecasting is essential in order for policy-makers to anticipate future requirements so that they may plan and respond effectively. We present a model-based nowcasting and forecasting system based on calibration of a dynamical epidemic model to observational data. We apply Bayesian model calibration and initialisation methods that are well established in other fields, but that do not appear to have been used in the UK in the current outbreak. We show that it would have been possible using our methods to diagnose and forecast the rapid growth of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK by mid-March. We also show that model calibration can successfully estimate the effect of the lockdown policies in various European countries, deducing correctly that the reproduction number was likely less than 1 around three weeks after the lockdown date. This is significantly earlier than has been achieved by other approaches. Our current (16 May) estimate for the reproduction number in the UK is $R = 0.8$ with a 95\\% range of 0.7 -- 0.9.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James D Annan","author_inst":"Blue Skies Research Ltd"},{"author_name":"Julia C Hargreaves","author_inst":"Blue Skies Research Ltd"},{"author_name":"Edd Francis O Felix","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Mamplata","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065268","rel_title":"Countries should aim to lower the reproduction number R close to 1.0 for the short-term mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065268","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic is still in its early stages and given the speed and magnitude of local outbreaks it is urgent to understand how mitigation measures translate into changes in key epidemiological and clinical outcomes. Here, we employ a mathematical model to explore the short-term consequences of lowering the reproduction number number R0 and delaying measures on total infections and fatalities. The positive implications of mitigation generally accrue as these measures are adopted early, with the most striking effects seen when the reproductive number is lowered to a level Rc{approx}1.0. As the delay in adopting measures exceeds approximately the half-way point to the peak of an outbreak, the effects of lowering R0 markedly decrease. Aiming for reproduction numbers close to 1.0 can substantially reduce fatality probabilities over short time scales, particularly for larger populations. We conclude that research is urgently needed on how mitigation measures impact R0 and how these can be optimized so as to achieve Rc{approx}1.0 whilst supporting individual freedoms, society and the economy.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael E.
