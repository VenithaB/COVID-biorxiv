Our model incorporates the asymptomatic infected individuals, who represent the majority of the infected population (with symptoms or not) and could play an important role in spreading the virus without any knowledge. We calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) via the next-generation matrix method and estimate the per day infection, death and recovery rates. The local stability of the disease free equilibrium is established in terms of R0. A sensibility analysis is performed to determine the relative importance of the model parameters to the disease transmission. We calibrate the parameters of the SEIARD model to the reported number of infected cases and fatalities for several states in Mexico by minimizing the sum of squared errors and attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak until August 2020.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ugo Avila-Ponce de Le\u00f3n","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"\u00c1ngel G.

Here, we validate use of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) intended for rapid screening and qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in serum, plasma, and whole blood, and compare results with ELISA. We also seek to establish the value of LFI testing on blood obtained from a capillary blood sample. Methods: Samples collected by venous blood draw and capillary finger stick were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR and control patients negative for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG\/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) lateral flow immunoassay, and antibody calls were compared with results obtained by ELISA. Results: The Biolidics LFI kit shows clinical sensitivity of 92% at 7 days after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 on venous blood. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG. There was no significant difference in detecting IgM and IgG with Biolidics LFI and ELISA at D0 and D7 (p=1.00), except for detection of IgM at D7 (p=0.04). Finger stick whole blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients showed 93% sensitivity for antibody detection. Conclusions: Clinical performance of Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG\/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) is comparable to ELISA and showed consistent results across different sample types. Furthermore, we show that capillary blood obtained by finger stick shows similar sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies as venous blood samples. This provides an opportunity for decentralized rapid testing in the community and may allow point-of-care and longitudinal self-testing for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Margaret A Black","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Guomiao Shen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Feng","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Wilfredo Garcia Beltran","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Feng","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Varshini Vasudevaraja","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Allison","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

The current study systematically examines the emerging evidence to identify an association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and COVID-19 disease outcome. Methods: Online literature databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Medrixv and BioRixv) were screened following standard search strategy having the appropriate keyword such as Obesity, Underweight, BMI, Body Mass Index, 2019-nCov, COVID-19, novel coronavirus, coronavirus disease. Studies published till 20th April 2020 were included without language restriction. These studies include case reports, case series, cohort, and any other which reported BMI, overweight\/obesity or underweight, and its complication with COVID-19 disease. Findings: Obesity plays a significant part in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients, though the role of BMI in the COVID-19 pandemic must not be ignored. Interpretation: Consequences of inflammation of adipose tissue has been reported as a leading cause of insulin resistance and hypertension due to metabolic dysfunction. The results of the current study show that BMI plays a significant role in COVID-19 severity in all ages, especially the elderly population. A panel should review COVID-19 patients with higher BMI and other co-morbidities, and they should be given increased vigilance, testing priority, and therapy. Further, the COVID-19 patients whose illness entered 7-10 days, age >50 yrs, and elevated CRP levels should have additional medical considerations. Recommendation: Population and patients with high BMI have moderate to high risk of medical complications with COVID-19, and hence their health status should be monitored more frequently.

We quantified access to public parks and gardens in urban areas of England and Wales, and the potential for park crowdedness during periods of high use. We combined data from the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance Survey to quantified (i) the number of parks within 500 and 1,000 metres of urban postcodes (i.e., availability), (ii) the distance of postcodes to the nearest park (i.e., accessibility), and (iii) per-capita space in each park for people living within 1,000m. We examined variability by city and share of flats. Around 25.4 million people can access public parks or gardens within a ten-minute walk, while 3.8 million residents live farther away; of these 21% are children and 13% are elderly. Areas with a higher share of flats on average are closer to a park but people living in these areas are potentially less able to meet social distancing requirements while in parks during periods of high use. Cities in England and Wales can provide residents with access to green space that enables outdoor exercise and play during social distancing. Keeping public parks and gardens open, might require measures such as dedicated park times for different age groups or entry allocation systems that, combined with smartphone apps or drones, can monitor and manage the total number of people using the park.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niloofar Shoari","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Majid Ezzati","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jill Baumgartner","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Diego Malacarne","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniela Fecht","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Varshini Vasudevaraja","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Allison","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

There is no existing pharmaceutical treatment that is known to be effective. Preliminary data shows that San Yao San Fang (SYSF) has clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19. The aim of this paper is to review existing data regarding the use of formulas within San Yao San Fang in the treatment of COVID-19 Search Strategy: We searched through 5 databases for studies on SYSF and patients with COVID-19 through April 2020. Eligibility Criteria: We included studies that included formulas within San Yao San Fang with or without Western interventions against Western interventions. Main results: We included 7 studies involving 532 patients. SYSF combined with Western interventions improved the recovery rate of symptoms such as fever (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.40 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.66, P < 0.01)), cough (RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.82, P < 0.01)) and fatigue (RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.78, P < 0.01)) and other symptoms such as headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, myalgia, dyspnoea and chest tightness (RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.83, P < 0.01)) as compared to the control group. SYSF combined with Western interventions reduced the duration of fever as compared to the control group. (Mean difference (MD) -1.18 (95% CI -1.45 to -0.91, P < 0.01)) In regards to adverse events, there is no statistical difference between the treatment group and the control group. (RR 1.62 (95% CI 0.83 to 3.17, P = 0.16)). SYSF combined with Western interventions did not show to significantly reduce duration of hospitalisation as compared to the control group.

DESIGN: Qualitative study consisting of five focus groups carried out between 1st-4th May 2020 (39-42 days after the official start of the UK lockdown). SETTING: Online video-conferencing PARTICIPANTS: 22 participants, all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of different genders, ages, ethnicities and locations. RESULTS: Participants were split roughly equally in number across three groups: will use the app; will not be using the app; and undecided as to whether they will use the app. Analysis revealed five main themes: (1) Lack of information and misconceptions surrounding COVID-19 contact tracing apps; (2) concerns over privacy; (3) concerns over stigma; (4) concerns over uptake; and (5) contact tracing as the 'greater good'. These themes were found across the sample and the three groups. However, concerns over privacy, uptake and stigma were particularly significant amongst those state they will not be using the app and the view that the app is for the 'greater good' was particularly significant amongst those who stated they will be using the app. One of the most common misconceptions about the app was that it could allow users to specifically identify and map COVID-19 cases amongst their contacts and in their vicinity. CONCLUSIONS: We offer four recommendations: (1) To offset the fact that many people may not be accessing, or might be avoiding, news coverage on COVID-19, authorities must communicate to the public via a range of methods including but not limited to: social media ads, postal information, text messaging and other emergency alert systems. (2) Communications should emphasise that the app cannot enable the user to identify which of their contacts has reported COVID-19 symptoms or tested positive. (3) Communication should emphasise collective responsibility ('the greater good') to promote social norms around use of the app (4) Communication should provide a slogan that maximises clarity of message, for example: 'Download the app, protect the NHS, save lives'.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon N Williams","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Armitage","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Tova Tampe","author_inst":"Independent consultant, World Health Organisation"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Dienes","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Lin Ho Wong","author_inst":"Ong Fujian Chinese Physician Hall"},{"author_name":"Pang Ong Wong","author_inst":"Ong Fujian Chinese Physician Hall"},{"author_name":"Douglas Allison","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

Machine learning algorithms built on radiography images can be used as a decision support mechanism to aid radiologists to speed up the diagnostic process. The aim of this work is to conduct a critical analysis to investigate the applicability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the purpose of COVID-19 detection in chest X-ray images and highlight the issues of using CNN directly on the whole image. To achieve this task, we first use 12-off-the-shelf CNN architectures in transfer learning mode on 3 publicly available chest X-ray databases together with proposing a shallow CNN architecture in which we train it from scratch. Chest X-ray images fed into CNN models without any preprocessing to follow the many of researches using chest X-rays in this manner. Next, a qualitative investigation performed to inspect the decisions made by CNNs using a technique known as class activation maps (CAM). Using CAMs, one can map the activations contributed most to the decision of CNNs back to the original image to visualize the most discriminating regions on the input image. We conclude that CNN decisions should not be taken into consideration, despite their high classification accuracy, until clinicians can visually inspect, and approve, the region(s) of the input image used by CNNs that lead to its prediction.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Taban Majeed","author_inst":"Salahaddin University"},{"author_name":"Rasber Rashid","author_inst":"Koya University"},{"author_name":"Dashti Ali","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Aras Asaad","author_inst":"Oxford Drug Design"},{"author_name":"Lin Ho Wong","author_inst":"Ong Fujian Chinese Physician Hall"},{"author_name":"Pang Ong Wong","author_inst":"Ong Fujian Chinese Physician Hall"},{"author_name":"Douglas Allison","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

This size shift caused the significant difference between the size specific (250 nm - 500 nm) filtration efficiency and overall filtration efficiency using the same NaCl test aerosol.

Methods: Aerosol generation during phacoemulsification was assessed using a model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Typical phacoemulsification settings were used and visible aerosol production was recorded using high speed 4K camera. Aerosolisation was evaluated under various experimental settings: Two different phacoemulsification tip sizes (2.2mm, 2.75mm), varying levels of corneal moisture, the use of suction and blowing air in the surgical field, the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating of the cornea with a static and moving tip. Results: This model demonstrates visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification with a 2.75mm phacoemulsification tip. No visible aerosol was noted with a 2.2mm tip. The presence of visible aerosol is unrelated to corneal wetting. Suction in close proximity to the aerosol plume did not impact on its dispersion. Blowing air redirected the aerosol plume towards the ocular surface. Visible aerosol production was abolished when HPMC was used to coat the cornea. This effect lasted for an average of 67{+\/-}8 seconds in the static model. Visible aerosol generation was discerned during movement of the 2.2mm tip towards the corneal wound. Conclusions: We demonstrate visible aerosol production in the setting of a model of a clear cornea phacoemulsification. Visible aerosol can be reduced using a 2.2mm phacoemulsification tip and reapplying HPMC every minute during phacoemulsification.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kieren Darcy","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Omar Elhaddad","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Asaf Achiron","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johannes Keller","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Duncan Leadbetter","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Derek Tole","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sidath E Liyanage","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

Presence of IgM\/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. Results: The test had a 100\/98.3 sensitivity\/specificity, and for IgG+ was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (N=34, P<0.001). At the outbreak start, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7%, 95% c.i. 0.3-6% (P<0.0001 vs. 120 historical controls). During the study period characterized by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2%, 95% c.i. 2.4-9.0, due to a rise in IgG+ tests to 5%, 95%CI 2.8-8.2 (P=0.004 for trend, adjusted weekly increase 2.7+\/-1.3%), but not of IgM+ (P=NS).

IgM+ was independently associated with higher triglycerides, eosinophils, and lymphocytes (P<0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the outbreak start. Social distancing may have been more effective in younger individuals, and by the end of April 2.4-9.0% of healthy adults had evidence of seroconversion. Asymptomatic infection may affect lipid profile and blood count.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luca Valenti","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Annalisa Bergna","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Serena Pelusi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Federica Facciotti","author_inst":"Istituto Europeo di Oncologia"},{"author_name":"Alessia Lai","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Maciej Tarkowski","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Berzuini","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda"},{"author_name":"Flavio Caprioli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Luigi Santoro","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Guido Baselli","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Carla Della Ventura","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Elisa Erba","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda"},{"author_name":"Silvano Bosari","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Daniele Prati","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Policlinico Milano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20098921","rel_title":"Behavioural change towards reduced intensity physical activity is disproportionately prevalent among adults with serious health issues or self-perception of high risk during the UK COVID-19 lockdown.","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20098921","rel_abs":"Importance: There are growing concerns that the UK COVID-19 lockdown has reduced opportunities to maintain health through physical activity, placing individuals at higher risk of chronic disease and leaving them more vulnerable to severe sequelae of COVID-19. Objective: To examine whether the UK's lockdown measures have had disproportionate impacts on intensity of physical activity in groups who are, or who perceive themselves to be, at heightened risk from COVID-19. Designs, Setting, Participants: UK-wide survey of adults aged over 20, data collected between 2020-04-06 and 2020-04-22. Exposures: Self-reported doctor-diagnosed obesity, hypertension, type I\/II diabetes, lung disease, cancer, stroke, heart disease. Self-reported disabilities and depression. Sex, gender, educational qualifications, household income, caring for school-age children. Narrative data on coping strategies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in physical activity intensity after implementation of UK COVID-19 lockdown (self-reported). Results: Most (60%) participants achieved the same level of intensity of physical activity during the lockdown as before the epidemic. Doing less intensive physical activity during the lockdown was associated with obesity (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.41), hypertension (OR 1.52, 1.33-1.71), lung disease (OR 1.31,1.13-1.49), depression (OR 2.02, 1.82-2.22) and disability (OR 2.34, 1.99-2.69). Participants who reduced their physical activity intensity also had higher odds of being female, living alone or having no garden, and more commonly expressed sentiments about personal or household risks in narratives on coping. Conclusions and relevance: Groups who reduced physical activity intensity included disproportionate numbers of people with either heightened objective clinical risks or greater tendency to express subjective perceptions of risk. Policy on exercise for health during lockdowns should include strategies to facilitate health promoting levels of physical activity in vulnerable groups, including those with both objective and subjective risks.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nina Trivedy Rogers","author_inst":"University College London (UCL)"},{"author_name":"Naomi Waterlow","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hannah E Brindle","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luisa Enria","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelley Lees","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chrissy h Roberts","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Flavio Caprioli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Luigi Santoro","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Guido Baselli","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Carla Della Ventura","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Elisa Erba","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda"},{"author_name":"Silvano Bosari","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Daniele Prati","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Policlinico Milano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20098780","rel_title":"Estimating the Global Infection Fatality Rate of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20098780","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, resulting in nearly three hundred thousand deaths distributed heterogeneously across countries.

We analyze global data to derive the IFR of COVID-19. Estimates of COVID-19 IFR in each country or locality differ due to variable sampling regimes, demographics, and healthcare resources. We present a novel statistical approach based on sampling effort and the reported case fatality rate of each country. The asymptote of this function gives the global IFR. Applying this asymptotic estimator to cumulative COVID-19 data from 139 countries reveals a global IFR of 1.04% (CI: 0.77%,1.38%). Deviation of countries' reported CFR from the estimator does not correlate with demography or per capita GDP, suggesting variation is due to differing testing regimes or reporting guidelines by country. Estimates of IFR through seroprevalence studies and point estimates from case studies or sub-sampled populations are limited by sample coverage and cannot inform a global IFR, as mortality is known to vary dramatically by age and treatment availability. Our estimated IFR aligns with many previous estimates and is the first attempt at a global estimate of COVID-19 IFR.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Grewelle","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Giulio De Leo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Hannah E Brindle","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luisa Enria","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelley Lees","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chrissy h Roberts","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Flavio Caprioli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Luigi Santoro","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Guido Baselli","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Carla Della Ventura","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Elisa Erba","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda"},{"author_name":"Silvano Bosari","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Daniele Prati","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Policlinico Milano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20102079","rel_title":"Retrospective Pooled Screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in late 2019","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20102079","rel_abs":"Reports have emerged documenting earlier SARS-CoV-2 cases than previously recognized.

Taking into account parameters associated to the population of each city and the mobility among them, the optimal control framework suggests the level and duration of protective measures that must be implemented to ensure that the number of infected individuals is within a range that avoids the collapse of the health care system. Compared against other mitigation measures that are implemented simultaneously and in equal strength across cities our method has three major particularities when: Accounts for city commute and health infrastructure: It takes into account the daily commute among cities to estimate the dynamics of infected people while keeping the number of infected people within a desired level at each city avoiding the collapse of its health care system. City-specific control: It allows for orchestrating the control measures among cities so as to prevent all cities to face the same level control. The model tends to induce alternation between periods of stricter controls and periods of a more normal life in each city and among the cities. Flexible scenarios: It is flexible enough to allow for simulating the impact of particular actions. For example, one can simulate the how the control all cities change when the number of care beds increases in specific places. Therefore, our method creates an automatic dance adjusting mitigation levels within cities and alternating among cities as suggested in~\\cite{Pue2020}. This automatic dance may help the city economy and orchestration of resources. We provide case studies using the major cities of the state of Sao Paulo given by using estimates on the daily mobility among the cities their health care system capacity. We use official data in our case studies. However, sub-notification of infected people in Brazil is notoriously high. Hence the case study should not be considered as a real world policy suggestion. It high sub-notification is taken into account, the optimal control algorithm will suggest stricter mitigation measures, as also shown in the case studies. Surprisingly, the total duration of the protocol for the state is barely affected by the sub-notification, but the severity of such protocols is strengthened. This stresses a twofold implication, first, the protocol depends on high-quality data and, second, such optimal and orchestrated protocol is robust and can be adjusted to the demand.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paulo J.

Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of in vitro reconstituted Nsp1-40S and of native human Nsp1-ribosome complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C-terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel.

Here, we report that afucosylated IgG which are of minor abundance in humans ([~]6% of total IgG) are specifically formed against surface epitopes of enveloped viruses after natural infections or immunization with attenuated viruses, while protein subunit immunization does not elicit this low fucose response. This can give beneficial strong responses, but can also go awry, resulting in a cytokine-storm and immune-mediated pathologies. In the case of COVID-19, the critically ill show aggravated afucosylated-IgG responses against the viral spike protein.

Identifying the modes of transmission that drive this phenomenon is a perquisite in devising effective control measures, but to date it is still under debate. To address this problem, we have formulated a detailed mathematical model of discrete human actions (such as coughs, sneezes, and touching) and the decay of the virus in the environment. To take into account both discrete and continuous events we have extended the common modelling approach and employed a hybrid stochastic mathematical framework. This allows us to calculate higher order statistics which are crucial for the reconstruction of the observed distributions. We focused on transmission within a household, the venue with the highest risk of infection and validated the model results against the observed secondary attack rate and the serial interval distribution. Detailed analysis of the model results identified the dominant driver of pre-symptomatic transmission as the contact route via hand-face transfer and showed that wearing masks and avoiding physical contact are an effective prevention strategy. These results provide a sound scientific basis to the present recommendations of the WHO and the CDC.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yehuda Arav","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Ziv Klausner","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Eyal Fattal","author_inst":"Israeli Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"H.

Among other important proteins, the role of accessory proteins are of immense importance in replication, regulation of infections of the coronavirus in the hosts. The largest accessory proteins in the SARS-CoV2 genome is ORF3a which modulates the host response to the virus infection and consequently it plays an important role in pathogenesis. In this study, an attempt is made to decipher the conservation of nucleotides, dimers, codons and amino acids in the ORF3a genes across thirty two genomes of Indian patients. ORF3a gene possesses single and double point mutations in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes suggesting the change of SARS-CoV2s virulence property in Indian patients. We find that the parental origin of the ORF3a gene over the genomes of SARS-CoV2 and Pangolin-CoV is same from the phylogenetic analysis based on conservations of nucleotides and so on. This study highlights the accumulation of mutation on ORF3a in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes which may provide the designing therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV2.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sk.

To overcome these limitations, we propose that elucidation and pharmacologic targeting of host cell Master Regulator proteins--whose aberrant activities govern the reprogramed state of infected-coronavirus cells--presents unique opportunities to develop novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to antiviral therapy, either as monotherapy or as a complement to established treatments. Specifically, we propose that a small module of host cell Master Regulator proteins (ViroCheckpoint) is hijacked by the virus to support its efficient replication and release. Conventional methodologies are not well suited to elucidate these potentially targetable proteins. By using the VIPER network-based algorithm, we successfully interrogated 12h, 24h, and 48h signatures from Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV, to elucidate the time-dependent reprogramming of host cells and associated Master Regulator proteins. We used the NYS CLIA-certified Darwin OncoTreat algorithm, with an existing database of RNASeq profiles following cell perturbation with 133 FDA-approved and 195 late-stage experimental compounds, to identify drugs capable of virtually abrogating the virus-induced Master Regulator signature. This approach to drug prioritization and repurposing can be trivially extended to other viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, as soon as the relevant infection signature becomes available.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pasquale Laise","author_inst":"DarwinHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Gideon Bosker","author_inst":"DarwinHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyun Sun","author_inst":"DarwinHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Yao Shen","author_inst":"DarwinHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Eugene F Douglass","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Charles Karan","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Ronald B Realubit","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sergey Pampou","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Andrea Califano","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Mariano J Alvarez","author_inst":"DarwinHealth Inc"},{"author_name":"Jan Nouta","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Suvi Natunen","author_inst":"Finnish Red Cross Blood Service"},{"author_name":"Carolien A.M.

To minimize clinical development time our methods validate vaccines with multiple peptide presentation algorithms to increase the probability that a vaccine will be effective. We optimize an objective function that is based on the presentation likelihood of a diverse set of vaccine peptides conditioned on a target population HLA haplotype distribution and expected epitope drift. We produce separate peptide formulations for MHC class I loci (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and class II loci (HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR) to permit signal sequence based cell compartment targeting using nucleic acid based vaccine platforms.

To combat it, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of how the virus infects host cells. Infection normally starts with the attachment of the virus to cell-surface glycans like heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides. In this study, we examined and compared the binding of the subunits and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV to these glycans. Our results revealed that the S proteins and subunits can bind to HS in a sulfation-dependent manner, the length of HS is not a critical factor for the binding, and no binding with sialic acid residues was detected. Overall, this work suggests that HS binding may be a general mechanism for the attachment of these coronaviruses to host cells, and supports the potential importance of HS in infection and in the development of antiviral agents against these viruses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Hao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Bo Ma","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ziheng Li","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaopan Gao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yaohao Li","author_inst":"University of Colorado"},{"author_name":"Bo Qin","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Shiying Shang","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Sheng Cui","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhongping Tan","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jan Nouta","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Suvi Natunen","author_inst":"Finnish Red Cross Blood Service"},{"author_name":"Carolien A.M.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which is transmitted from animal to human and because of being contagious, further it transmitted human to human. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is known as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) as a global pandemic. But, no specific medications are available for the treatment of COVID-19 so far. As a corollary, there is a need for a potential vaccine to impede the progression of the disease. Lately, it has been documented that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for viral replication as well as interferes with host immune responses. We have comparatively analyzed the sequences of N protein of SARS-CoV-2 for the identification of core attributes and analyzed the ancestry through phylogenetic analysis. Subsequently, we have predicted the most immunogenic epitope for T-cell as well as B-cell. Importantly, our investigation mainly focused on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I potential peptides and NTASWFTAL interacted with most human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that are encoded by MHC class I molecules. Further, molecular docking analysis unveiled that NTASWFTAL possessed a greater affinity towards HLA and also available in a greater range of the population. Our study provides a consolidated base for vaccine design and we hope that this computational analysis will pave the way for designing novel vaccine candidates.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed Rakib","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chittagong-4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Saad Ahmed Sami","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chittagong-4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

Nrf2 activity declines with age, making the elderly more susceptible to oxidative stress-mediated diseases, which include type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammation, and viral infections. Published evidence suggests that Nrf2 activity may regulate important mechanisms affecting viral susceptibility and replication. We examined gene expression levels by GeneChip microarray and by RNA-seq assays. We found that the potent Nrf2 activating composition PB125(R) downregulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in human liver-derived HepG2 cells. ACE2 is a surface receptor and TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein for SARS-Cov-2 entry into host cells. Furthermore, in endotoxin-stimulated primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells we report the marked downregulation by PB125 of 36 genes encoding cytokines. These include IL1-beta, IL6, TNF-, the cell adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, and E-selectin, and a group of IFN-{gamma}-induced genes. Many of these cytokines have been specifically identified in the \"cytokine storm\" observed in fatal cases of COVID-19, suggesting that Nrf2 activation may significantly decrease the intensity of the storm.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joe M McCord","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Brooks M.

A still-debated percentage of patients develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after infection, whose symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. Acute and life-threatening respiratory symptoms are experienced by 10-20% of symptomatic patients, particularly those with underlying medical conditions that includes diabetes, COPD and pregnancy. One of the main challenges in the containment of COVID-19 is the identification and isolation of asymptomatic\/pre-symptomatic individuals. As communities re-open, large numbers of people will need to be tested and contact-tracing of positive patients will be required to prevent additional waves of infections and enable the continuous monitoring of the viral loads COVID-19 positive patients. A number of molecular assays are currently in clinical use to detect SARS-CoV-2. Many of them can accurately test hundreds or even thousands of patients every day. However, there are presently no testing platforms that enable more than 10,000 tests per day. Here, we describe the foundation for the REcombinase Mediated BaRcoding and AmplificatioN Diagnostic Tool (REMBRANDT), a high-throughput Next Generation Sequencing-based approach for the simultaneous screening of over 100,000 samples per day. The REMBRANDT protocol includes direct two-barcoded amplification of SARS-CoV-2 and control amplicons using an isothermal reaction, and the downstream library preparation for Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. This protocol represents a potentially powerful approach for community screening, a major bottleneck for testing samples from a large patient population for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dario Palmieri","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Jalal K Siddiqui","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Anne Gardner","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Fishel","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Wayne Miles","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Natalie S.

The spike (S) protein of the virus forms a trimer and catalyzes fusion between viral and target cell membranes - the first key step of viral infection. Here we report two cryo-EM structures, both derived from a single preparation of the full-length S protein, representing the prefusion (3.1[A] resolution) and postfusion (3.3[A] resolution) conformations, respectively. The spontaneous structural transition to the postfusion state under mild conditions is independent of target cells. The prefusion trimer forms a tightly packed structure with three receptor-binding domains clamped down by a segment adjacent to the fusion peptide, significantly different from recently published structures of a stabilized S ectodomain trimer. The postfusion conformation is a rigid tower-like trimer, but decorated by N-linked glycans along its long axis with almost even spacing, suggesting possible involvement in a mechanism protecting the virus from host immune responses and harsh external conditions. These findings advance our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 enters a host cell and may guide development of vaccines and therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongfei Cai","author_inst":"Boston Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Boston Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Xiao","author_inst":"Boston Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hanqin Peng","author_inst":"Boston Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarah M.
