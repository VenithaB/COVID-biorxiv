This study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of Australian adults towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures. In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would somewhat affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high. 84.9% had performed [&ge;]1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 93.4% performed [&ge;]1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month. Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government\/authorities (aOR: 5.5, 95% CI 3-9.0), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.8-6.9) and higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). Interpretation: In the last two months, members of the public have been inundated with messages about hygiene and social (physical) distancing. However, our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies, as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Holly Seale","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Anita E Heywood","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Julie Leask","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Meru Steel","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Susan Thomas","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"David N Durrheim","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Bolsewicz","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Rajneesh Kaur","author_inst":"University of Sydney"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20091017","rel_title":"Effects of home confinement on mental health and lifestyle behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak: Insight from the \"ECLB-COVID19\" multi countries survey","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20091017","rel_abs":"Background: Although recognised as effective measures to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, social distancing and self-isolation, have been suggested to generate burden throughout the population. To provide scientific data to help identify risk-factors for the psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 outbreak, an international cross-disciplinary online survey was circulated in April 2020. This report outlines the mental, emotional and behavioural consequences of COVID-19 home confinement. Method: Thirty-five research organisations from four continents promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in Ten different languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement period. Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Western-Asia (36%), North-Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other countries (3%) were analysed. The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P < 0.001; 0.43 [&le;] d [&le;] 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing psychosocial and emotional disorders (10% to 16.5%). These psychosocial tolls were associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing (i) physical (+15.2%) and social (71.2%) inactivity, (ii) poor sleep quality (12.8%), (iii) unhealthy diet behaviours (10%), and (iv) unemployment (6%). Conversely, participants demonstrated a greater use (15%) of technology solutions during the confinement period. Conclusion: These findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the current home confinement period and provide a clear remit for the urgent implementation of technology-based intervention to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL).","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ACHRAF AMMAR","author_inst":"Otto-Von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Khaled Trabelsi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany Michael Brach"},{"author_name":"Hamdi Chtourou","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Boukhris","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Liwa Masmoudi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany Michael Brach"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany Michael Brach"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany Michael Brach"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Leipziger Str. 44, Magdeburg, 39120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Leipziger Str. 44, Magdeburg, 39120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

Analysis of data from the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait can provide important information about the potential epidemic and healthcare burdens as well as assist in evaluating the potential impact of various outbreak control measures. Such control measures are essentially implemented to achieve a sufficient reduction in the effective reproduction number during an outbreak. In this study, we use a mathematical modeling framework to simulate the outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait and forecast the potential burden on the healthcare system. We calibrate the model against daily numbers of detected infection and death cases using a maximum likelihood framework and estimate both the basic and effective reproduction numbers. Our results indicate that the early control measures implemented in Kuwait had the effect of delaying the intensity of the outbreak but were unsuccessful in reducing Rt below 1. This highlights a need for a systematic investigation of the current public health interventions as well as a scientific surveillance tool that is sufficiently sensitive to outbreak temporal dynamics. Meanwhile, the developed model can serve as a public health tool to control the current outbreak and can be used to anticipate effective measures should a second wave re-emerge in Kuwait.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdullah A.

Methods Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately (>13%) black and all other (<13% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated and population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. Results Nearly ninety-seven percent of disproportionately black counties (656\/677) reported a case and 49% (330\/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987\/2,465) and 28% (684\/ 2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The PAF of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3% for counties with <13% black residents and 4.2% for counties with >13% black residents. Conclusions Nearly twenty-two percent of US counties are disproportionately black and they accounted for 52% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58% of COVID-19 deaths nationally. County-level comparisons can both inform COVID-19 responses and identify epidemic hot spots. Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Greg Millett","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Austin T Jones","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"David Benkeser","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Stefan D Baral","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Laina Mercer","author_inst":"PATH"},{"author_name":"Chris Beyrer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brian Honnermann","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Elise Lankiewicz","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Lenandro Mena","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S Crowley","author_inst":"O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Sherwood","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Patrick S Sullivan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

Methods: Across 46 variables, we defined five broad categories: 1) access to medical, 2) underlying health conditions, 3) environmental exposures, 4) vulnerability to natural disasters, and 5) sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. We also used reported rates for morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality in other regions to estimate risk at the county (Harris County) and census tract levels. Analysis: A principal component analysis was undertaken to reduce the dimensions. Then, to identify vulnerable census tracts, we conducted rank-based exceedance and K-means cluster analyses. Results: Our study showed a total of 722,357 (~17% of the County population) people, including 171,403 between the ages of 45-65 (~4% of County population), and 76,719 seniors (~2% of County population), are at a higher risk based on the aforementioned categories. The exceedance and K-means cluster analysis demonstrated that census tracts in the northeastern, eastern, southeastern and northwestern regions of the County are at highest risk. The results of age-based estimations of hospitalization rates showed the western part of the County might be in greater need of hospital beds. However, cross-referencing the vulnerability model with the estimation of potential hospitalized patients showed that part of the County has the least access to medical facilities. Conclusion: Policy makers can use this planning tool to identify neighborhoods at high risk for becoming hot spots; efficiently match community resources with needs, and ensure that the most vulnerable have access to equipment, personnel, and medical interventions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amin Kiaghadi","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Hanadi S Rifai","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Winston Liaw","author_inst":"University of Houston College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan D Baral","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Laina Mercer","author_inst":"PATH"},{"author_name":"Chris Beyrer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brian Honnermann","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Elise Lankiewicz","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Lenandro Mena","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S Crowley","author_inst":"O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Sherwood","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Patrick S Sullivan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

As the availability and speed of SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms improve, results are increasingly relied upon to inform critical decisions related to therapy, use of personal protective equipment, and workforce readiness. However, early reports of RT-PCR test performance have left clinicians and the public with concerns regarding the reliability of this predominant testing modality and the interpretation of negative results. In this work, two independent research teams report the frequency of discordant SARS-CoV-2 test results among initially negative, repeatedly tested patients in regions of the United States with early community transmission and access to testing. Methods: All patients at the University of Washington (UW) and Stanford Health Care undergoing initial testing by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab between March 2nd and April 7th, 2020 were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed targeting the N, RdRp, S, and E genes and ORF1ab, using a combination of Emergency Use Authorization laboratory-developed tests and commercial assays. Results through April 14th were extracted to allow for a complete 7-day observation period and an additional day for reporting. Results: A total of 23,126 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests (10,583 UW, 12,543 Stanford) were performed in 20,912 eligible patients (8,977 UW, 11,935 Stanford) undergoing initial testing by NP swab; 626 initially test-negative patients were re-tested within 7 days. Among this group, repeat testing within 7 days yielded a positive result in 3.5% (4.3% UW, 2.8% Stanford) of cases, suggesting an initial false negative RT-PCR result; the majority (96.5%) of patients with an initial negative result who warranted reevaluation for any reason remained negative on all subsequent tests performed within this window. Conclusions: Two independent research teams report the similar finding that, among initially negative patients subjected to repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, the occurrence of a newly positive result within 7 days is uncommon. These observations suggest that false negative results at the time of initial presentation do occur, but potentially at a lower frequency than is currently believed. Although it is not possible to infer the clinical sensitivity of NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing using these data, they may be used in combination with other reports to guide the use and interpretation of this common testing modality.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dustin R Long","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Hogan","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Alex L Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Vikas OReilly Shah","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chloe Bryson-Cahn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Bryan Stevens","author_inst":"Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christina S Kong","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Noel S Weiss","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jacob Sunshine","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

It is already indicated in patients with COVID-19 and worsening respiratory status. The rapid spread of the pandemic to all continents, albeit with a nonuniform community transmission, necessitates chest imaging for medical triage of patients presenting moderate-severe clinical COVID-19 features. This paper reports the development of innovative machine learning schemes for the analysis of Chest X-Ray (CXR) scan images of COVID-19 patients in almost real-time, demonstrating significantly high accuracy in identifying COVID-19 infection. The performance testing was conducted on a combined dataset comprising CXRs of positive COVID-19 patients, patients with various viral and bacterial infections, as well as persons with a clear chest. The test resulted in successfully distinguishing CXR COVID-19 infection from the other cases with an average accuracy of 94.43%, sensitivity 95% and specificity 93.86%.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhurgham Al-karawi","author_inst":"Medical Analytica Ltd"},{"author_name":"Shakir Al-Zaidi","author_inst":"Medical Analytica Ltd"},{"author_name":"Nisreen Polus","author_inst":"Medical Analytica Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sabah Jassim","author_inst":"University of Buckingham"},{"author_name":"Vikas OReilly Shah","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chloe Bryson-Cahn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Bryan Stevens","author_inst":"Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christina S Kong","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Noel S Weiss","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jacob Sunshine","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

Respiratory disorders in COVID-19 caused by the virus commonly present as viral pneumonia-like opacities in chest X-ray images which are used as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for confirmation and evaluating disease progression. The surge places high demand on medical services including radiology expertise. However, there is a dearth of sufficient training data for developing image-based automated decision support tools to alleviate radiological burden. We address this insufficiency by expanding training data distribution through use of weakly-labeled images pooled from publicly available CXR collections showing pneumonia-related opacities. We use the images in a stage-wise, strategic approach and train convolutional neural network-based algorithms to detect COVID-19 infections in CXRs. It is observed that weakly-labeled data augmentation improves performance with the baseline test data compared to non-augmented training by expanding the learned feature space to encompass variability in the unseen test distribution to enhance inter-class discrimination, reduce intra-class similarity and generalization error. Augmentation with COVID-19 CXRs from individual collections significantly improves performance compared to baseline non-augmented training and weakly-labeled augmentation toward detecting COVID-19 like viral pneumonia in the publicly available COVID-19 CXR collections.

In this scenario, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning (DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four classes viz, normal, other_disease, pneumonia and Covid-19. A 5-fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using chest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the possibility of replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall accuracy was measured as 95.3%{+\/-}0.02. In order to get an idea about the COVID-19 detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more attention during the classification. This was found to strongly correlate with clinical findings, as validated by experts.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanhita Basu","author_inst":"NA"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Mitra","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute"},{"author_name":"Nilanjan Saha","author_inst":"Centre for Translational & Clinical Research, Jamia Hamdard"},{"author_name":"Sabah Jassim","author_inst":"University of Buckingham"},{"author_name":"Vikas OReilly Shah","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chloe Bryson-Cahn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Bryan Stevens","author_inst":"Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christina S Kong","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Noel S Weiss","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jacob Sunshine","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

In the first search, eight systematic reviews were found, of which five were done in pediatric population; after reviewing 67 primary studies we found no data on pediatric asthma as a comorbidity for COVID-19. In the second search, we found 25 results in PubMed, of which five reported asthma in adults, but none included data on children. In the third search, 14 pre-prints in MedRxiv were identified with data on asthma, but again none with pediatric data. We found only one report by the U.S. CDC stating that 40\/345 (~11.5%) children with data on chronic conditions had \"chronic lung diseases including asthma\". There is scarcely any data on whether childhood asthma (or other pediatric respiratory diseases) constitute risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity.

AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States is not well-described. Objective: To provide information about frequency, outcomes and recovery associated with AKI and dialysis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design: Observational, retrospective study. Setting: Admitted to hospital between February 27 and April 15, 2020. Participants: Patients aged [&ge;]18 years with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 Exposures: AKI (peak serum creatinine increase of 0.3 mg\/dL or 50% above baseline). Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with mortality. We also trained and tested a machine learning model for predicting dialysis requirement with independent validation. Results: A total of 3,235 hospitalized patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. AKI occurred in 1406 (46%) patients overall and 280 (20%) with AKI required renal replacement therapy. The incidence of AKI (admission plus new cases) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit was 68% (553 of 815). In the entire cohort, the proportion with stages 1, 2, and 3 AKI were 35%, 20%, 45%, respectively. In those needing intensive care, the respective proportions were 20%, 17%, 63%, and 34% received acute renal replacement therapy. Independent predictors of severe AKI were chronic kidney disease, systolic blood pressure, and potassium at baseline. In-hospital mortality in patients with AKI was 41% overall and 52% in intensive care. The aOR for mortality associated with AKI was 9.6 (95% CI 7.4-12.3) overall and 20.9 (95% CI 11.7-37.3) in patients receiving intensive care. 56% of patients with AKI who were discharged alive recovered kidney function back to baseline. The area under the curve (AUC) for the machine learned predictive model using baseline features for dialysis requirement was 0.79 in a validation test. Conclusions and Relevance: AKI is common in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, associated with worse mortality, and the majority of patients that survive do not recover kidney function. A machine-learned model using admission features had good performance for dialysis prediction and could be used for resource allocation.","rel_num_authors":63,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lili

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in COVID-19 patients are scarce due to difficulties to obtain such examination in infected unstable patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective: To investigate the occurrence of structural brain abnormalities in non-survivors of COVID-19 in a virtopsy framework. Design: Prospective, case series study with postmortem brain MRI obtained early (<24h) after death. Setting: Monocentric study. Participants: From 31\/03\/2020 to 24\/04\/2020, consecutive decedents who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria were included: death <24 hours, SARS-CoV-2 detection on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, chest computerized tomographic (CT) scan suggestive of COVID-19, absence of known focal brain lesion, and MRI compatibility. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Signs of acute brain injury and MRI signal abnormalities along the olfactory tract and brainstem were searched independently by 3 neuroradiologists, then reviewed with neurologists and clinicians. Results: Among the 62 patients who died from COVID-19 during the inclusion period, 19 decedents fulfilled inclusion criteria. Subcortical micro- and macro-bleeds (2 decedents), cortico-subcortical edematous changes evocative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES, one decedent), and nonspecific deep white matter changes (one decedent) were observed. Asymmetric olfactory bulbs were found in 4 other decedents without downstream olfactory tract abnormalities. No brainstem MRI signal abnormality. Conclusions and Relevance: Postmortem brain MRI demonstrates hemorrhagic and PRES-related brain lesions in non-survivors of COVID-19 that might be triggered by the virus-induced endothelial disturbances. SARS-CoV-2-related olfactory impairment seems to be limited to olfactory bulbs. The absence of brainstem MRI abnormalities does not support a brain-related contribution to respiratory distress in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tim

Using a dynamic panel representation of an epidemiological model of disease spread, the paper develops a Vulnerability Index for US counties from daily reported number of cases over a 20-day period of rapid disease growth. County-level economic, demographic, and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country. These factors are also used to examine the number of reported deaths. The paper finds that counties with high median income have a high incidence of cases but reported lower deaths. Income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, is found to be associated with more deaths and more cases. The remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports is evidence of the spread of the virus by way of international travel. The distributions of age, race, and health risk factors such as obesity and diabetes are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties. Counties with better access to health care as measured by the number of primary care physicians per capita have lower deaths, and so do places with more health awareness as measured by flu vaccination prevalence. Environmental health conditions such as the amount of air pollution is found to be associated with counties with higher deaths from the virus. It is hoped that research such as these will help policymakers to develop risk factors for each region of the country to better contain the spread of infectious diseases in the future.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nivedita Mukherji","author_inst":"Oakland University"},{"author_name":"Valentina Lolli","author_inst":"CUB Hopital Erasme, Universite libre

This study aims to investigate social perception of coronavirus in the Internet media during the epidemic. It is a signal report highlighting the main issues in public perception and medical commutation in real time. METHODS: We study the perception of COVID-19 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet on platforms: Google, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry, from January 2020 to 29.04.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.20). We present trend analysis with a support of natural language processing techniques. RESULTS: We identified seven temporal major clusters of interest on the topic COVID-19: 1) Chinese, 2) Italian, 3) Waiting, 4) Mitigations, 5) Social distancing and Lockdown, 6) Anti-crisis shield, 7) Restrictions releasing. There was an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease around 11\/12.03.20 with a massive mitigation program. Later on, there was a decay in interest with additional phases related to social distancing and an anti-crisis legislation act with local peaks. We have found that declarations of mitigation strategies by the Polish prime minister or the minister of health gathered the highest attention of Internet users. So enacted or in force events do not affect interest to such extent. Traditional news agencies were ahead of social media (mainly Twitter) in dissemination of information. We have observed very weak or even negative correlations between a colloquial searching term antiviral mask in Google, encyclopaedic definition in Wikipedia SARS-CoV-2 as well official incidence series, implying different mechanisms governing the search for knowledge, panic related behaviour and actual risk of acquiring infection. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional and social media do not only reflect reality, but also create it. Risk perception in Poland is unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring COVID-19. As traditional media are ahead of social media in time, we advise to choose traditional news media for a quick dissemination of information, however for a greater impact, social media should be used. Otherwise public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrzej Jarynowski","author_inst":"Institute for

From 3\/10\/2020-5\/1\/2020 NewYork-Presbyterian laboratories performed 27,377 SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays from 22,338 patients. Repeat testing was performed in 3,432 patients, of which 2,413 had negative and 1,019 had positive first day results. Repeat-tested patients were more likely to be older, male, African-American or Hispanic, and to have severe disease. Among the patients with initially negative results, 18.6% became positive upon repeat-testing. Only 58.1% of any-time positive patients had a result of \"detected\" on the first test. The clinical sensitivity of COVID-19 molecular assays is estimated between 66.2% and 95.6%, depending on the unknown number of false negative results in single-tested patients. Conversion to a negative result is unlikely to occur before 15 to 20 days after initial testing or 20-30 days after the onset of symptoms, with 50% conversion occurring at 28 days after initial testing. Forty-nine initially-positive patients converted to negative and then back to positive in subsequent days. Conversion from first day negative to positive results increased linearly with each day of testing, reaching 25% probability in 20 days. In summary, our study provides estimates of the clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays and suggests time frames for appropriate repeat testing, namely 15 to 20 days after a positive test and the same or next 2 days after a negative test in a patient with high suspicion for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel A.

However, the global genetic diversity and transmissions are still unclear. Methods: 3050 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were retrieved from GIASID database. After aligned by MAFFT, the mutation patterns were identified by phylogenetic tree analysis. Results: We detected 17 high frequency (>6%) mutations in the 3050 sequences. Based on these mutations, we classed the SARS-CoV-2 into four main groups and 10 subgroups. We found that group A was mainly presented in Asia, group B was primarily detected in North America, group C was prevailingly appeared in Asia and Oceania and group D was principally emerged in Europe and Africa. Additionally, the distribution of these groups was different in age, but was similar in gender. Group A, group B1 and group C2 were declined over time, inversely, group B2, group C3 and group D were rising. At last, we found two apparent expansion stages (late Jan-2020 and late Feb-2020 to early Mar-2020, respectively). Notably, most of groups are quickly expanding, especially group D. Conclusions: We classed the SARS-CoV-2 into four main groups and 10 subgroups based on different mutation patterns at first time. The distribution of the 10 subgroups was different in geography, time and age, but not in gender. Most of groups are rapidly expanding, especially group D. Therefore, we should attach importance to these genetic diversity patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and take more targeted measures to constrain its spread.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhi-wei Chen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Ministry of Education"},{"author_name":"Zhao Li","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Institute of Surgery Research, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Hu Li","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Ministry of Education"},{"author_name":"Hong Ren","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Ministry of Education"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Ministry of Education"},{"author_name":"Tanya Lawson","author_inst":"Division of Medical Microbiology and Virology, St Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"R.

To characterize the host responses and identify potential biomarkers during disease progression, we performed a longitudinal transcriptome analysis for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from 4 COVID-19 patients at 4 different time points from symptom onset to recovery. We found that PBMCs at different COVID-19 disease stages exhibited unique transcriptome characteristics. SARS-CoV-2 infection dysregulated innate immunity especially type I interferon response as well as the disturbed release of inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators, and an aberrant increase of low-density neutrophils may cause tissue damage. Activation of cell death, exhaustion and migratory pathways may lead to the reduction of lymphocytes and dysfunction of adaptive immunity.

We used a simple epidemic model to evaluate how contact tracing might enable modification of current physical distancing restrictions. Testing and tracing coverage need to exceed 50% in order to see substantial gains; if both are below 50%, contact tracing cannot reduce transmission by more than 10%. With 90% testing and tracing as well as high isolation and quarantine efficacy, contact tracing could reduce overall transmission by >45%, which would allow for partial loosening of physical distancing measures. Benefits of contact tracing could be enhanced by testing all contacts rather than only those with symptoms and by policies to support high adherence to voluntary isolation and quarantine.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alyssa Bilinski","author_inst":"Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences"},{"author_name":"Farzad

Alternative approaches based on combinations of isothermal amplification and CRISPR-mediated detection, such as the SHERLOCK ( S pecific H igh S ensitivity E nzymatic R eporter Un LOCK ing) technique, offer reduced dependence on RT-qPCR equipment, but previously reported methods required multiple fluid handling steps, complicating their deployment outside clinical labs. Here we developed a simple test chemistry called STOP (SHERLOCK Testing in One Pot) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in one hour that is suitable for point-of-care use. This simplified test, STOPCovid, provides sensitivity comparable to RT-qPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests and has a limit of detection of 100 copies of viral genome input in saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs per reaction. Using lateral flow readout, the test returns result in 70 minutes, and using fluorescence readout, the test returns result in 40 minutes. Moreover, we validated STOPCovid using nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients and were able to correctly diagnose 12 positive and 5 negative patients out of 3 replicates. We envision that implementation of STOPCovid will significantly aid \"test-trace-isolate\" efforts, especially in low-resource settings, which will be critical for long-term public health safety and effective reopening of the society.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Joung","author_inst":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT; Department of Biological Engineering at MIT"},{"author_name":"Alim Ladha","author_inst":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT; Department of Biological Engineering at MIT"},{"author_name":"Makoto Saito","author_inst":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT; Departments of Biological Engineering and Bra"},{"author_name":"Michael Segel","author_inst":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT; Departments of Biological Engineering and Bra"},{"author_name":"Robert Bruneau","author_inst":"University of Washington, Seattle"},{"author_name":"Meei-li W Huang","author_inst":"University of Washington, Seattle"},{"author_name":"Nam-Gyun Kim","author_inst":"University of Washington, Seattle"},{"author_name":"Xu Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard; Massachusetts General Hospital; Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard; Brigham and Women's Hospital; Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness"},{"author_name":"Bruce D.

There is no specific treatment or vaccine identified and the focus has been preventive measures based on statistical and mathematical models. These have relied on analyzing the behavior of populations and characteristics of the infection and applying modelling techniques. The analysis of epidemiological curve fitting on number of daily infections across affected countries could give useful insights on the characteristics of the epidemic. A variety of phenomenological models are available to capture dynamics of disease spread and growth. Data for this study used the number of daily new infections and cumulative number of infections in COVID-19 in three selected countries, Sri Lanka, Italy and Hebei province of China, from the first day of appearance of cases to 20th April 2020. In this study Gompertz, Logistic and Exponential growth curves were fitted on cumulative number of infections across countries. Akaikes information criteria (AIC) was used in determining the best fitting curve for each country. Results revealed that the most appropriate growth curves for Sri Lanka, Italy and China-Hebei are Exponential, Gompertz and Logistic curves respectively. The overall growth rate and final epidemic size evaluated from best models for the three countries and short-term forecasts were also generated. Log incidences over time in each country were regressed before and after the identified peak time of the respective outbreaks of countries. Hence, doubling time\/halving time together with daily growth rates and predictions were estimated. Findings altogether demonstrate that outbreak seems extinct in Hebei-China whereas further transmissions are possible in Sri Lanka. In Italy, current outbreak transmits in a decreasing rate.

However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, generally lacked quantitative measurements, were mostly restricted to data from single countries. Here, we report the development, implementation and initial results of a multi-lingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, 8 other, ages 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change+\/-100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7+\/- 28.7, mean+\/- SD), taste (-69.0+\/- 32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3+\/- 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell, but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.","rel_num_authors":122,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valentina Parma","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, Temple University"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Ohla","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Research Center J\u00fclich"},{"author_name":"Maria G.

Human milk IgG originates mainly from blood, therefore a SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibody (Ab) response in milk would be expected (1). However, IgG comprises only ~2% of milk Ab, with most milk Abs originating from mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (1). Therefore, the extent of the milk immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown (2). This response is critical for infants and young children, who tend not to suffer greatly from COVID-19 pathology but are likely responsible for significant virus transmission (3-5). Perhaps even more significant is the fact that milk Abs could be purified and used as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given they would likely be of the secretory (s) class and highly resistant to proteolytic degradation in the respiratory tissue (2, 6). In this preliminary report, 15 milk samples obtained from donors previously-infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as 10 negative control samples obtained prior to December 2019 were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by ELISAs measuring IgA, IgG, IgM, and secretory Ab. Eighty percent of samples obtained post-COVID-19 exhibited IgA reactivity, and all these samples were also positive for secretory Ab reactivity, suggesting the IgA is predominantly sIgA. COVID-19 group mean OD values of undiluted milk were significantly greater for IgA (p<0.0001), secretory-type Abs (p<0.0001), and IgG (p=0.017), but not for IgM, compared to pre-pandemic group mean values. Overall, these data indicate that there is strong sIgA-dominant SARS-CoV-2 immune response in human milk after infection in the majority of individuals, and that a comprehensive study of this response is highly warranted.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alisa Fox","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jessica Marino","author_inst":"University of California Merced"},{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hahn-Holbrook","author_inst":"University of California Merced"},{"author_name":"Susan Zolla-Pazner","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rebecca L Powell","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Bouysset","author_inst":"Institut de Chimie de Nice, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pirastu","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michele Dibattista","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sensory Organs, Universita' degli Studi di Bari A.

Widely used statistical and computer methods for modeling and forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 are epidemiological models. Although these epidemiological models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission od epidemics, their prediction accuracies are quite low. To overcome this limitation, we formulated the real-time forecasting and evaluating multiple public health intervention problem into forecasting treatment response problem and developed recurrent neural network (RNN) for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics and Counterfactual-RNN (CRNN) for evaluating and exploring public health intervention strategies to slow down the spread of Covid-19 worldwide. We applied the developed methods to the real data collected from January 22, 2020 to May 8, 2020 for real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the world.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiyang Ge","author_inst":"Fu Dan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Shudi Li","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Momiao Xiong","author_inst":"University of Texas School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Rebecca L Powell","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Bouysset","author_inst":"Institut de Chimie de Nice, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pirastu","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michele Dibattista","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sensory Organs, Universita' degli Studi di Bari A.

Within approximately 30 days, the total number of confirmed cases climbed up to 1,000, accompanied by a doubling period of less than 3 days. About one week later, after this number exceeded 4,000 cases, and following some extreme lockdown measures taken by the Israeli government, the daily infection rate started a sharp decrease from the peak value of 1,131 down to slightly more than 100 new confirmed cases on April 30. Motivated by this encouraging data, similar to the trends observed in many other countries, along with the growing economic pressures, the Israeli government has quickly lifted most of its emergency regulations. Throughout May, the daily number of new cases stayed at a very low level of 20-40 until at the end of May it started a steady increase, exceeding 1,000 by the end of June and 2,000 on July 22. As suggested by some experts and popular media, this disturbing trend may be even a part of a \"second wave\". This article attempts to analyze the currently available data on Israel, compared to three European countries (Greece, Italy, and Sweden), in order to understand the local dynamics of COVID-19, assess the effect of the implemented intervention measures, and discuss some plausible scenarios for the foreseeable future.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Last","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Shudi Li","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Momiao Xiong","author_inst":"University of Texas School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Rebecca L Powell","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Bouysset","author_inst":"Institut de Chimie de Nice, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pirastu","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michele Dibattista","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sensory Organs, Universita' degli Studi di Bari A.

We present an insight into the spread of Covid19 in Nigeria in order to establish a suitable prediction model, which can be applied as a decisionsupportive tool for assigning health interventions and mitigating the spread of the Covid19 infection. Methodology: Daily spread data from February 27 to April 26, 2020, were collected to construct the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model using the R software. Stability analysis and stationarity test, parameter test, and model diagnostic were also carried out. Finally, the fitting, selection and prediction accuracy of the ARIMA model was evaluated using the AICc model selection criteria. Results: The ARIMA (1,1,0) model was finally selected among ARIMA models based upon the parameter test and Box Ljung test. A ten day forecast was also made from the model, which shows a steep upward trend of the spread of the COVID19 in Nigeria within the selected time frame. Conclusion: Federal Government of Nigeria through the presidential task force can apply the forecasted trend of much more spread to make more informed decisions on the additional measures in place to curb the spread of the virus. Application of the model can also assist in studying the effectiveness of the lockdown on the on the spread of Covid19 in Nigeria.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rauf Rauf Ibrahim","author_inst":"Department of mathematics, University of Abuja, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"OLUWAKEMI HANNAH OLADIPO","author_inst":"Bioresource Development Centre (BIODE\/NABDA), Ilorin"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Hou","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rishemjit Kaur","author_inst":"V1-B, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation"},{"author_name":"Marco Tullio Liuzza","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Marta Y.

As such, the corresponding mathematical models and their simulations are central tools to guide political decision-making. Typically, ODE-based models are considered, in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time. In this work, we translate an ODE-based COVID-19 spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi-agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures. We observe a large dependency of the epidemic's dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph, which is not adequately captured by existing ODE-models. For instance, existence of super-spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super-spreaders. Overall, we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics, which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0. We conclude that deterministic models fitted to COVID-19 outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerrit Grossmann","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Michael Backenkoehler","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Verena Wolf","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Hou","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rishemjit Kaur","author_inst":"V1-B, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation"},{"author_name":"Marco Tullio Liuzza","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Marta Y.

Planners, governments, and agencies are scrambling to figure out \"How much? How bad?\" and how to effectively treat the potentially large numbers of simultaneously sick people. Modeling the CoVID-19 pandemic using an exponential rise implicitly assumes a nearly unlimited population of uninfected persons (\"dilute pandemic\"). Once a significant fraction of the population is infected (\"saturated pandemic\"), an exponential growth no longer applies. A new model is developed here, which modifies the standard exponential growth function to account for factors such as Social Distancing. A Social Mitigation Parameter [SMP] \/s\\ is introduced to account for these types of society-wide changes, which can modify the standard exponential growth function, as follows: N(t)= No exp[ +Ko t\/(1 + \/s\\ t)] . The doubling-time t\/dbl\\=(ln2)\/Ko can also be used to substitute for Ko, giving a {t\/dbl\\, \/s\\} parameter pair for comparing to actual CoVID-19 data. This model shows how the number of CoVID-19 infections can self-limit before reaching a saturated pandemic level. It also provides estimates for: (a) the timing of the pandemic peak, (b) the maximum number of new daily cases that would be expected, and (c) the expected total number of CoVID-19 cases. This model shows fairly good agreement with the presently available CoVID-19 pandemic data for several individual States, and the for the USA as a whole (6 Figures), as well as for various countries around the World (9 Figures). An augmented model with two Mitigation Parameters, \/s\\ and {beta}\/s\\, is also developed, which can give better agreement with the daily new CoVID-19 data. Data-to-model comparisons also indicate that using \/s\\ by itself likely provides a worst-case estimate, while using both \/s\\ and {beta}\/s\\ likely provides a best-case estimate for the CoVID-19 spread.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Genghmun Eng","author_inst":"Retired Scientist"},{"author_name":"Michael Backenkoehler","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Verena Wolf","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Hou","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rishemjit Kaur","author_inst":"V1-B, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation"},{"author_name":"Marco Tullio Liuzza","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Marta Y.
