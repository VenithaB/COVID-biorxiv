In this paper we investigate this presumption by comparing the frequency of admissions of stroke cases in Bangladesh before and during the pandemic.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of stroke admissions in a 100-bed stroke unit at the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital (NINS&H) which is considerably a large stroke unit. We considered all the admitted cases from the 1st January to the 30th June, 2020. We used Poisson regressions to determine whether statistically significant changes in admission counts can be found before and after 25 March since when there is a surge in COVID-19 infections.\n\nResultsA total of 1394 stroke patients got admitted during the study period. Half of the patients were older than 60 years, whereas only 2.6% were 30 years old or younger with a male-female ratio of 1.06:1. From January to March, 2020 the mean rate of admission was 302.3 cases per month which dropped to 162.3 cases per month from April to June with an overall reduction of 46.3% in acute stroke admission per month. In those two periods, reductions in average admission per month for ischemic stroke (IST), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and venous stroke (VS) were 45.5%, 37.2%, 71.4% and 39.0%, respectively. Based on weekly data, results of Poisson regressions confirm that the average number of admissions per week dropped significantly during the last three months of the sample period. Further, in the first three months, a total of 22 cases of hyperacute stroke management were done whereas in the last three months there was an 86.4% reduction in the number of hyperacute stroke patients getting reperfusion treatment. Only 38 patients (2.7%) were later found to be RT- PCR for SARS Cov-2 positive based on nasal swab testing.\n\nConclusionOur study revealed more than fifty percent reduction in acute stroke admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is still elusive whether the reduction is related to the fear of getting infected by COVID-19 from hospitalization or the overall restriction on public movement and stay-home measures.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"A T M Hasibul Hasan","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"},{"author_name":"Subir  Chandra Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"},{"author_name":"Muhammad  Sougatul Islam","author_inst":"BioTED"},{"author_name":"Mohaimen Mansur","author_inst":"Institute of Statistical Research and Training"},{"author_name":"Md Shajedur  Rahman Shawon","author_inst":"Center for Big Data Research in Health"},{"author_name":"Rashedul Hassan","author_inst":"Green Life Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Shah  Jahirul Hoque Chowdhury","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"},{"author_name":"Md Badrul  Alam Mondal","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quazi  Deen Mohammad","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"neuroscience"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.25.20198986","rel_title":"Influence of COVID-19 confinement measures on appendectomies in Germany - administrative claims data analysis of 9,797 patients","rel_date":"2020-09-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.25.20198986","rel_abs":"Purpose: COVID 19 pandemic had multiple influences on the social, industrial and medical situation in all affected countries. Measures of obligatory medical confinement were suspensions of scheduled non-emergent surgical procedures and outpatients clinics as well as overall access restrictions to hospitals and medical practices. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess if the obligatory confinement (lockdown) had an effect on the number of appendectomies (during and after the period of lockdown). Methods: This retrospective study was based on anonymized nationwide administrative claims data of the German Local General Sickness Fund (AOK). Patients admitted for disease of the appendix (ICD-10: K35-K38) or abdominal and pelvic pain (ICD-10: R10) who undergone an appendectomy (OPS: 5-470) were included. The study period included six weeks of German lockdown (16.03.-26.04.2020) as well as six weeks before (03.02.-15.03.2020) and after (27.04.-07.06.2020). These periods were compared to the respective in 2019. Results: Overall number of appendectomies was significantly reduced during the lockdown time in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease affects only appendectomies due to acute simple and non-acute appendicitis. Numbers for appendectomies in acute complex appendicitis remained unchanged. Female patients and in the age group 1-18 years showed the strongest decrease in number of cases. Conclusion: The lockdown in Germany resulted in a decreased number of appendectomies. This affected mainly appendectomies in simple acute and non-acute appendicitis, but not complicated acute appendicitis. The study gives no evidence, that the confinement measures resulted in a deterioration of medical care for appendicitis.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthias Maneck","author_inst":"AOK Research Institute, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Guenster","author_inst":"AOK Research Institute, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hans-Joachim Meyer","author_inst":"German Society of Surgery, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claus-Dieter Heidecke","author_inst":"Department of General, Visceral, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Universitaetsmedizin Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany"},{"author_name":"Udo Rolle","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Surgery and Paediatric Urology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rashedul Hassan","author_inst":"Green Life Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Shah  Jahirul Hoque Chowdhury","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"},{"author_name":"Md Badrul  Alam Mondal","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quazi  Deen Mohammad","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.25.20201533","rel_title":"Equity in Paediatric Emergency Departments during COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.25.20201533","rel_abs":"Childrens attendances in paediatric emergency departments have fallen precipitously in North East England and elsewhere in recent months.

Objective: To investigate the use of psychoactive substances in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil. Method: A cross-sectional and prospective observational study, undertaken in a virtual environment. An online survey was developed and employed through Google Forms to collect data. The survey was made available to participants on social networks, Facebook@, Whatsapp@, and Instagram@, linked to the research group, during the period 06\/15\/2020 to 07\/15\/2020. 1,145 individuals participated in the research. Results: The average age of the participants was 37 years old. They were mostly female, white, Brazilians, with a higher education level, with occupations in the health field, and had religion. They either maintained their family income or suffered a small income decrease. Moreover, they informed that they were caring for social isolation. The most used substances before and after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic were alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, although the use of these substances decreased (P<0.001). Approximately 32% of the participants started using psychoactive substances in this period. Among them, most individuals started by their own initiative. Conclusions: For a better understanding of the pattern use of psychoactive substances during the Covid-19 pandemic and the adverse effects on human behavior and mental disorders, careful longitudinal studies must be developed, due to the great interest in the knowledge of adaptive responses when people's lives are at risk.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cesar Augusto Trinta Weber","author_inst":"Centro de Estudos Jose de Barros Falcao"},{"author_name":"Ingridi Teixeira Monteiro","author_inst":"Centro de Estudos Jose de Barros Falcao"},{"author_name":"Julia Medeiros Gehrke","author_inst":"Centro de Estudos Jose de Barros Falcao"},{"author_name":"Wagner Silva de Souza","author_inst":"Centro de Estudos Jose de Barros Falcao"},{"author_name":"Anna Brough","author_inst":"Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stephen Owens","author_inst":"Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust & Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Shah  Jahirul Hoque Chowdhury","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"},{"author_name":"Md Badrul  Alam Mondal","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quazi  Deen Mohammad","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.25.20201616","rel_title":"COVID-19 in Youth Soccer","rel_date":"2020-09-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.25.20201616","rel_abs":"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the case and incidence rates of COVID-19 among youth soccer players and evaluate the relationship with background COVID-19 risk and phase of return to play. Methods: Surveys were distributed to soccer clubs throughout the country regarding their phase of return to soccer (individual only, group non-contact, group contact) and date of reinitiation, number of players, cases of COVID-19, and risk reduction procedures that were being implemented. Overall case and incidence rates were compared to national pediatric data and county data from the prior 10 weeks where available. Finally, a negative binomial regression model was developed to predict club COVID-19 cases with local incidence rate and phase of return as covariates and the log of club player-days as an offset. Results: 129 clubs responded, of whom 124 had reinitiated soccer, representing 91,007 players with a median duration of 73 days (IQR: 53-83 days) since restarting. Of the 119 that had progressed to group activities, 218 cases of COVID-19 were reported among 85,861 players. Youth soccer players had a lower case rate and incidence rate than the national rate for children in the US (254 v. 477 cases per 100,000; IRR = 0.511, 95% CI = [0.40-0.57], p<0.001) and the general population from the counties in which soccer clubs were based where data was available (268 v. 864 cases per 100,000; IRR = 0.202 [0.19-0.21], p<0.001). After adjusting for local COVID-19 incidence, there was no relationship between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return (non-contact: {beta}=0.35{+\/-}0.67, p=0.61; contact: {beta}=0.18{+\/-}0.67, p=0.79). No cases were reported to have resulted in hospitalization or death. 100% of clubs reported having a plan in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and utilizing multiple different risk reduction procedures (median 8, IQR 6-10). Conclusions: The incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes is relatively low when compared to the background incidence among children in the United States and the local general population. No relationship was identified between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return to soccer. Youth soccer clubs universally report implementing a number of risk reduction procedures.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Watson","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kristin Haraldsdottir","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kevin Biese","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Leslie Goodavish","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Bethany Stevens","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Timothy McGuine","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Shah  Jahirul Hoque Chowdhury","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"},{"author_name":"Md Badrul  Alam Mondal","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quazi  Deen Mohammad","author_inst":"National Institute of Neurosciences & Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"sports medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.24.20200196","rel_title":"Cost-effectiveness of remdesivir and dexamethasone for COVID-19 treatment in South Africa","rel_date":"2020-09-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.24.20200196","rel_abs":"Background South Africa recently experienced a first peak in COVID-19 cases and mortality. Dexamethasone and remdesivir both have the potential to reduce COVID-related mortality, but their cost-effectiveness in a resource-limited setting with scant intensive care resources is unknown. Methods We projected intensive care unit (ICU) needs and capacity from August 2020 to January 2021 using the South African National COVID-19 Epi Model. We assessed cost-effectiveness of 1) administration of dexamethasone to ventilated patients and remdesivir to non-ventilated patients, 2) dexamethasone alone to both non-ventilated and ventilated patients, 3) remdesivir to non-ventilated patients only, and 4) dexamethasone to ventilated patients only; all relative to a scenario of standard care. We estimated costs from the healthcare system perspective in 2020 USD, deaths averted, and the incremental cost effectiveness ratios of each scenario. Results Remdesivir for non-ventilated patients and dexamethasone for ventilated patients was estimated to result in 1,111 deaths averted (assuming a 0-30% efficacy of remdesivir) compared to standard care, and save $11.5 million. The result was driven by the efficacy of the drugs, and the reduction of ICU-time required for patients treated with remdesivir. The scenario of dexamethasone alone to ventilated and non-ventilated patients requires additional $159,000 and averts 1,146 deaths, resulting in $139 per death averted, relative to standard care. Conclusions The use of dexamethasone for ventilated and remdesivir for non-ventilated patients is likely to be cost-saving compared to standard care. Given the economic and health benefits of both drugs, efforts to ensure access to these medications is paramount.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Youngji Jo","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lise Jamieson","author_inst":"Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office"},{"author_name":"Ijeoma Edoka","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Long","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheetal Silal","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Juliet R.C.

We find that the model is most accurate for states that so far had not shown signs of multiple waves of the disease (such as New York), and least accurate for states where transmission rates increased after initially declining (such as Hawaii). For such states, we propose an alternate multi-phase model. Both the base model and multi-phase model provide a way to explain historical reported cases and deaths with a small set of parameters, which in the future can enable analyses of uncertainty and variations in disease progression across regions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mingdong Lyu","author_inst":"Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Randolph Hall","author_inst":"Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Ijeoma Edoka","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Long","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheetal Silal","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Juliet R.C.

The viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they relate to infectiousness and disease progression are not well understood. Here, we develop data-driven viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the URT and LRT. We fit the models to viral load data from patients with likely infection dates known, we estimated that infected individuals with a longer incubation period had lower rates of viral growth, took longer to reach peak viremia in the URT, and had higher chances of presymptomatic transmission. We then developed a model linking viral load to infectiousness. We found that to explain the substantial fraction of transmissions occurring presymptomatically, the infectiousness of a person should depend on a saturating function of the viral load, making the logarithm of the URT viral load a better surrogate of infectiousness than the viral load itself. Comparing the roles of target-cell limitation, the innate immune response, proliferation of target cells and spatial infection in the LRT, we found that spatial dissemination in the lungs is likely to be an important process in sustaining the prolonged high viral loads. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for predicting how SARS-CoV-2 within-host dynamics determine infectiousness and represent a step towards quantifying how viral load dynamics and the immune responses determine disease severity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruian Ke","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Carolin Zitzmann","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ruy M.

A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that correlated with use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Vella","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania\/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Josephine R.

These decision will occur in a constantly shifting social-epidemiological landscape where the success of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like physical distancing requires broad population acceptance. We developed a coupled social-epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Schools and workplaces are closed and re-opened based on reported cases. We used evolutionary game theory and mobility data to model individual adherence to NPIs. We explored the impact of vaccinating 60+ year-olds first; <20 year-olds first; uniformly by age; and a novel contact-based strategy. The last three strategies interrupt transmission while the first targets a vulnerable group. Vaccination rates ranged from 0.5% to 4.5% of the population per week, beginning in January or July 2021. Case notifications, NPI adherence, and lockdown periods undergo successive waves during the simulated pandemic. Vaccination reduces median deaths by 32%-77% (22%-63%) for January (July) availability, depending on the scenario. Vaccinating 60+ year-olds first prevents more deaths (up to 8% more) than transmission-interrupting strategies for January vaccine availability across most parameter regimes. In contrast, transmission-interrupting strategies prevent up to 33% more deaths than vaccinating 60+ year-olds first for July availability, due to higher levels of natural immunity by that time. Sensitivity analysis supports the findings. Further research is urgently needed to determine which populations can benefit from using SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to interrupt transmission.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Jentsch","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Madhur Anand","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Chris T Bauch","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Derek A Oldridge","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Caroline Diorio","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Leticia Kuri-Cervantes","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cecile Alanio","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Maria Betina Pampena","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Jennifer E Wu","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Zeyu Chen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Yinghui Jane Huang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M.

The vast majority of these tests are qualitative and use a single target for antibody detection, incorporating either full-length or truncated versions of the nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins from SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, mono-epitope tests - whether qualitative or quantitative - are unable to localise antibody binding or characterise the distribution and titres of epitope recognition by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within an individual or across a population. However, it seems plausible that if such information were available, it may correlate with the presence of potent, high-titre, neutralising antibodies that afford protection again imminent re-infection, as well as with the likelihood of developing a memory B-cell response that would provide more durable protection. We have developed a novel, quantitative, multi-antigen, multiplexed, array-based immunoassay platform, ImmuSAFE COVID+ (ImmuSAFE) comprising 6 functionally validated domains or regions of the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed using Sengenics KREX technology. This array platform enables determination of both the position and breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses following natural infection or vaccination. To validate our platform, 100 serum samples (confirmed sero-positive COVID-19 cases, n=50; pre-pandemic HIV positive controls, n=50) were tested for IgG seropositivity to the N antigen, yielding 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. All 50 cases showed positive antibody reactivity towards at least one N protein epitope, whilst all 50 controls showed antibody reactivity below threshold values. Broad variation was also observed in the magnitude and breadth of antibodies present, represented as an Epitope Coverage score (EPC). A positive correlation was observed between increasing age and EPC values, with individuals under 40 years old having a mean EPC score of 3.1, whilst individuals above the age of 60 had a mean EPC of 5.1. This finding may have broad implications for the natural history of COVID-19 disease in different individuals.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan M Blackburn","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Nur Diana Anuar","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ti-Myen Tan","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew JM Nel","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Muneerah Smith","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Kavithambigai Ellan","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Research,  Infectious Disease Research Centre, Selangor, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nur Izwani Shaiful Bahrin","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Research,  Infectious Disease Research Centre, Selangor, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nurul Shielawati Mohamed Rosli","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Noorul Hidayah Badri","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Teh Norleila Abdul Rahman","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Arif Anwar","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Rozainanee Mohd Zain","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Research,  Infectious Disease Research Centre, Selangor, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sigrid Gouma","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kevin O.

Mouthwash fluid has been reported as an alternative to nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. We compared mouthwash fluid with a combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab regarding test performance. Methods: We tested asymptomatic persons with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and their household contacts. First, a mouthwash (gargling for at least 5 sec) with sterile water was performed. Then, with a single flocked swab the back of the throat and subsequently the nasopharynx were sampled. Samples were inactivated and analysed on a Roche cobas 6800 system with the Roche SARS-CoV-2 test. Results: Of 76 persons, 39 (51%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by oro-nasopharyngeal swab. Mouthwash detected 13 (17%) of these infections but did not detect any additional infection. Samples that were positive in both tests, had lower cycle threshold (Ct)-values for oro-nasopharyngeal samples, indicating a higher virus concentration, compared to samples only positive in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusions: Mouthwash is not as sensitive as combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab in detecting upper respiratory tract infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wiebke Michel","author_inst":"Otto-von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Farber","author_inst":"Otto-von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Milica Dilas","author_inst":"Otto-von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Ina Tammer","author_inst":"Otto-von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Jannik Baar","author_inst":"Otto-von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Achim J.

Materials and methods Eligible studies evaluating the prognostic value of fasting BG (FBG) and random BG (RBG) levels in predicting COVID-19 outcomes were included and assessed for risk of bias with the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Random-effects high-vs-low meta-analysis followed by dose-response analysis using generalized least squares model in a two-stage random-effects meta-analysis were conducted. Potential non-linear association was explored using restricted cubic splines and pooled using restricted maximum likelihood model in a multivariate meta-analysis. Results The search yielded 35 studies involving a total of 14,502 patients. We discovered independent association between admission FBG and poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated non-linear relationship between admission FBG and severity (Pnon-linearity<0.001), where each 1 mmol\/L increase augmented the risk of COVID-19 severity by 33% (risk ratio 1.33 [95% CI: 1.26-1.40]). Albeit exhibiting similar trends, study scarcity limited the strength of evidence on the independent prognostic value of admission RBG. GRADE assessment yielded high-quality evidence for the association between admission FBG and COVID-19 severity, and moderate-quality evidence for its association with mortality and poor outcomes, while the other assessments yielded very low-to-low quality. Conclusion High level of FBG at admission was independently associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Further researches to confirm the observed prognostic value of admission RBG and to ascertain the estimated dose-response risk between admission FBG and on COVID-19 severity are required.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gilbert Lazarus","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Jessica Audrey","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Vincent Kharisma Wangsaputra","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Alice Tamara","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Dicky L.

To avoid early information bias, we used detailed age and gender stratified death certificate and hospitalisation data to evaluate the epidemic's trajectory and infer the cause of its decline using a stochastic model. Our results are consistent with heterogenous transmission reducing over time due to the development of herd immunity. Relative to a baseline model that assumed homogenous mixing across Manaus, a model that permitted a small, self-isolated population fraction raised the estimated herd-immunity threshold from 28% to 30% and reduced the final attack rate from 86% to 65%. In the latter scenario, a substantial proportion of vulnerable, older individuals remained susceptible to infection. Given uncertainties regarding the distancing behaviours of population subgroups with different social and economic characteristics, and the duration of sterilising or transmission-modifying immunity in exposed individuals, we conclude that the potential for epidemic outbreaks remains, but that future waves of infection are likely to be much less pronounced than that already experienced.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Prowse","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Tara Purcell","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne and Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Djane Clarys Baia-da-Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Vanderson Sampaio","author_inst":"Fundacao de Vigilancia em Saude; Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Wuelton Marcelo Monteiro","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Amazonas; Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"James Wood","author_inst":"UNSW"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Walter + Eliza Hall Institute, Univ. of Melbourne, and Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marcus Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Joshua Ross","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Arif Anwar","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Rozainanee Mohd Zain","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Research,  Infectious Disease Research Centre, Selangor, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sigrid Gouma","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kevin O.

Management of these infants can be challenging given unique airway anatomy and potential malformations. Airway emergency management must be immediate and precise, often demanding specialized equipment and\/or expertise. We developed a Neonatal-Infant Airway Safety Program to improve medical responses, communication, equipment usage and outcomes for infants requiring emergent airway interventions. Patients and Methods All patients admitted to our quaternary neonatal and infant intensive care unit (NICU) from 2008-2019 were included in this study. Our program consisted of a multidisciplinary airway response team, pager system, and emergency equipment cart. Respiratory therapists present at each emergency event recorded specialist response times, equipment utilization, and outcomes. A multidisciplinary oversite committee reviewed each incident. Results Since 2008, there were 159 airway emergency events in our NICU (~12 per year). Mean specialist response times decreased from 5.9{+\/-}4.9 min (2008-2012, mean{+\/-}SD) to 4.3{+\/-}2.2 min (2016-2019, p=0.12), and the number of incidents with response times >5 min decreased from 28.8{+\/-}17.8% (2008-2012) to 9.3{+\/-}11.4% (2016-2019, p=0.04 by linear regression). As our program became more standardized, we noted better equipment availability and subspecialist communication. Few emergency situations (n=9, 6%) required operating room management. There were 3 patient deaths (2%). Conclusions Our airway safety program, including readily available specialists and equipment, facilitated effective resolution of airway emergencies in our NICU and multidisciplinary involvement enabled rapid and effective changes in response to COVID-19 regulations. A similar program could be implemented in other centers.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Thom","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Hitesh Deshmukh","author_inst":"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Leane Soorikian","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Ian Jacobs","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"John Fiadjoe","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Janet Lioy","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Walter + Eliza Hall Institute, Univ. of Melbourne, and Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marcus Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Joshua Ross","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Arif Anwar","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Rozainanee Mohd Zain","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Research,  Infectious Disease Research Centre, Selangor, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sigrid Gouma","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kevin O.

Design: A population-based case control study with additional cohort analysis. Setting: Primary care patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Participants: 16 866 patients with COVID-19 events in the CPRD from 29th January to June 25th 2020 and 70 137 matched controls. Main outcome measures: We explored associations between COVID-19 diagnosis and prescriptions for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (B), calcium-channel blockers (C), thiazide diuretics (D) and other antihypertensive drugs (O). We evaluated all-cause mortality among COVID-19 cases. Analyses were adjusted for covariates and consultation frequency. Results: In covariate adjusted analyses, ACEIs were associated with lower odds of COVID-19 diagnosis (0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.88) as were ARBs, 0.87 (0.80 to 0.95) with little attenuation from adjustment for consultation frequency. In fully adjusted analyses, C and D were also associated with lower odds of COVID-19. Increased odds of COVID-19 for B (1.19, 1.12 to 1.26), were attenuated after adjustment for consultation frequency (1.01, 0.95 to 1.08). In adjusted analyses, patients treated with ACEIs or ARBs had similar mortality to patients treated with classes B, C, D or O (1.00, 0.83 to 1.20) or patients receiving no antihypertensive therapy (0.99, 0.83 to 1.18). Conclusions: Associations were sensitive to adjustment for confounding and healthcare seeking, but there was no evidence that antihypertensive therapy is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or mortality; most classes of antihypertensive therapy showed negative associations with COVID-19 diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma Rezel-Potts","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Phil J Chowienczyk","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Martin C Gulliford","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"John Fiadjoe","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Janet Lioy","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Walter + Eliza Hall Institute, Univ. of Melbourne, and Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marcus Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Joshua Ross","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Arif Anwar","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Rozainanee Mohd Zain","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Research,  Infectious Disease Research Centre, Selangor, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sigrid Gouma","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kevin O.

This study explores the working conditions and issues faced by Australian HCWs. Methods: Qualitative analysis of free-text responses from Australian HCWs from 3 August to 5 August 2020 from an open letter calling for better respiratory protection for HCWs, transparent reporting of HCW COVID-19 infections and diversity in national infection control policy development. The open letter was sent to an email list of 23,000 HCWs from a previous campaign and promoted on social media. Results: Among 2,733 HCWs who signed the open letter during the study period, 407 free-text responses were analysed. Doctors and nurses accounted for 58% and 35% of respondents, respectively. Most respondents came from Victoria (48%); New South Wales (18%); Queensland (12%) or Western Australia (12%). Dominant themes included concerns about: work health and safety standards; guidelines on respiratory protection including the omission of fit-testing of P2\/N95 respirators; deficiencies in the availability, quality, appropriateness and training of personal protective equipment; a top-down workplace culture that enabled bullying in response to concerns about safety that culminated a loss of trust in leadership, self-reported COVID-19 infections in some respondents and moral injury. Conclusion: Occupational moral injury in HCWs is the consequence of lapses in leadership at policy-making and organisational levels that have violated the normative expectations of HCWs. The challenge for healthcare leaders is to address workplace culture, consultation and engagement with HCWs in order to prevent this hidden pandemic from spreading throughout the health system.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle Ananda-Rajah","author_inst":"Hospital, Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Veness","author_inst":"Hospital, Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Danielle Berkovic","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Catriona Parker","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Greg Kelly","author_inst":"Hospital, Sydney"},{"author_name":"Darshini Ayton","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Walter + Eliza Hall Institute, Univ. of Melbourne, and Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marcus Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Joshua Ross","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Arif Anwar","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Rozainanee Mohd Zain","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Research,  Infectious Disease Research Centre, Selangor, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sigrid Gouma","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kevin O.

Methods: Phone interviews and follow-ups were completed with 112 mild COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive adult patients, over a 6 week period. Results: More than one symptom at disease onset was experienced by ~70 of the patients. Over one third of patients experienced fever, dry cough, headache, or muscle ache as the first symptom. If fatigue was reported, it was usually the first symptom to appear. Smell and taste changes had occurred 3.9 {+\/-} 5.4 and 4.6 {+\/-} 5.7 days (mean {+\/-} SD) since disease onset and emerged as first symptoms in 15% and 18% of patients, respectively. Fever was the shortest lasting symptom (5.8 {+\/-} 8.6 days (mean {+\/-} SD), and smell and taste changes were the most long-lasting symptoms (24.3 {+\/-} 22.9 days and 19.4 {+\/-} 19.1 (mean {+\/-} SD), respectively), with longer smell recovery correlated with smell change severity. In one third of patients who reported cough, smell and taste changes, these symptoms persisted after negative RT-PCR tests. Conclusions: Each symptom can occur as first or later, though some are more likely to appear as firsts, and typically more than one symptom occurs at disease onset. The severity of olfactory change is associated with its recovery time. Lack of chemosensory recuperation in recovered patients is common. These findings can aid patients through their illness and provide expected recovery patterns.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hadar Klein","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Kim Asseo","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Noam Karni","author_inst":"Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School"},{"author_name":"Yuval Benjamini","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Ran Nir-Paz","author_inst":"Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mordechai Muszkat","author_inst":"Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah Israel","author_inst":"Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Masha Y Niv","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Marcus Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Joshua Ross","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Arif Anwar","author_inst":"Sengenics Corporation"},{"author_name":"Rozainanee Mohd Zain","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Research,  Infectious Disease Research Centre, Selangor, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sigrid Gouma","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kevin O.

Large-scale testing is limited by the need for in-person blood collection by staff trained in venepuncture. Capillary blood self-sampling and postage to laboratories for analysis could provide a reliable alternative. Two-hundred and nine matched venous and capillary blood samples were obtained from thirty nine participants and analysed using a COVID-19 IgG ELISA to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Thirty seven out of thirty eight participants were able to self-collect an adequate sample of capillary blood ([&ge;]50 l). Using plasma from venous blood collected in lithium heparin as the reference standard, matched capillary blood samples, collected in lithium heparin-treated tubes and on filter paper as dried blood spots, achieved a Cohen's kappa coefficient of >0.88 (near-perfect agreement). Storage of capillary blood at room temperature for up to 7 days post sampling did not affect concordance. Our results indicate that capillary blood self-sampling is a reliable and feasible alternative to venepuncture for serological assessment in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lottie Brown","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachel Louise Byrne","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alice Fraser","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sophie I Owen","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana I Cubas Atienzar","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chris Williams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Grant A Kay","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luis E Cuevas","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph R A Fitchett","author_inst":"Mologic, UK"},{"author_name":"Tom Fletcher","author_inst":"Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Gala Garrod","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Konstantina Kontogianni","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sanjeev Krishna","author_inst":"St George's University of London"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Menzies","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tim Planche","author_inst":"St George's University of London"},{"author_name":"Chris Sainter","author_inst":"Mologic, UK"},{"author_name":"Henry M Staines","author_inst":"St George's University of London"},{"author_name":"Lance Turtle","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Divij Mathew","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Oliva Kuthuru","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eileen C.

Such a methodology can be applied worldwide to predict forecasts of the outbreak in any infected country. The pandemic in Brazil was selected as a first study case. Brazilian official published data from February 25th to August 30th, 2020 was used to adjust a few epidemiologic parameters. The estimated time-dependence mean value to the infected individuals (confirmed cases) presents - in logarithmic scale - standard deviation SD = 0.08 for over six orders of magnitude. Data points for additional three weeks were added after the model was complete, granting confidence on the outcomes. By the end of 2020, the predicted numbers of confirmed cases in Brazil, within 95% credible intervals, may reach 6 Million (5 to 7), and fatalities would accounts for 180 (130 to 220) thousands. The total number of infected individuals is estimated to reach (13 +\/- 1) Million, 6.2% of the Brazilian population.

There is currently no approved vaccine to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and only very few treatment options are available to manage COVID-19 patients. For development of preclinical countermeasures, reliable and well-characterized small animal disease models will be of paramount importance. Here we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into Syrian hamsters consistently caused moderate broncho-interstitial pneumonia, with high viral lung loads and extensive virus shedding, but animals only displayed transient mild disease. We determined the infectious dose 50 to be only five infectious particles, making the Syrian hamster a highly susceptible model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neither hamster age nor sex had any impact on the severity of disease or course of infection. Finally, prolonged viral persistence in interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain knockout hamsters revealed susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to adaptive immune control. In conclusion, the Syrian hamster is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 making it a very suitable infection model for COVID-19 countermeasure development.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe Syrian hamster is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 making it an ideal infection model for COVID-19 countermeasure development.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyle Rosenke","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Michael C Letko","author_inst":"Paul G.

The greatest limitations emerged is the lack of effective treatment and vaccination due to frequent mutations and reassortment of the virus, leading to evolvement of different strains. We identified a wide variability in the whole genome sequences as well as spike protein variants (responsible for binding with ACE2 receptor) of SARS Cov2 identified globally. Structural variations of spike proteins identified from representative countries from all the continents, seven of them have revealed genetically similar, may be regarded as the dominant type.

Here, we compared conventional PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods with hybrid techniques such as polymerase chain displacement reaction (PCDR) and a newly developed PCR-LAMP method. We found that the hybrid methods demonstrated higher sensitivity and assay reaction rates than those of the classic LAMP and PCR techniques and can be used to for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The proposed methods based on the modern hybrid amplification techniques markedly improve virus detection and, therefore, can be extremely useful in the development of new diagnostic kits.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dmitriy A Varlamov","author_inst":"Syntol, Moscow"},{"author_name":"Konstantin A Blagodatskikh","author_inst":"Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Evgeniya V Smirnova","author_inst":"Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry (RAS)"},{"author_name":"Vladimir M.

Electrostatic filters may reduce cross-infection. This study aims to determine if including a filter in the bubble CPAP circuit impacts stability of pressure delivery. Methods: A new electrostatic filter was placed before (pre) or after (post) the bubble CPAP generator, or with no filter (control) in an in vitro study. Pressure was recorded at the nasal interface for 18 h (6 L\/min; 7 cmH2O) on three occasions for each configuration. Filter failure was defined as pressure >9 cmH20 for 60 continuous minutes. The filter was weighed before and after each experiment. Results: Mean (SD) time to reach the fail-point was 257 (116) min and 525 (566) min for filter placement pre- and post-CPAP generator, respectively. Mean pressure was higher throughout in the pre-generator position compared to control. The filter weight was heavier at study end in the pre- compared to the post-generator position. Conclusions: Placement of the filter at the pre-generator position in a bubble CPAP circuit should be avoided due to unstable mean pressure. Filters are likely to become saturated with water over time. The post-generator position may accommodate a filter, but regular pressure monitoring and early replacement are required.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan W Davis","author_inst":"King Edward Memorial and Perth Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"J Jane Pillow","author_inst":"School of Human Sciences, University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Matt Cooper","author_inst":"Biometrics, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Mar Janna Dahl","author_inst":"School of Human Sciences, University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Konstantin B Ignatov","author_inst":"Institut obsej genetiki imeni N I Vavilova RAN"},{"author_name":"Yanan Liu","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tsing-Lee Tang-Huau","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Rong Li","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Friederike Feldmann","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Zhongde Wang","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Michael Jarvis","author_inst":"University of Plymouth"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Henry M Staines","author_inst":"St George's University of London"},{"author_name":"Lance Turtle","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Divij Mathew","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Oliva Kuthuru","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eileen C.

We aimed to rapidly evaluate the impact and effectiveness of these communication materials for passengers in the early stages of the pandemic. Methods In stage I (Patient and Public Involvement, PPI) we interviewed seven travellers who had returned from China in January and February 2020. We used these results to develop a questionnaire and topic guides for stage II, a cross-sectional survey and follow-up interviews with passengers arriving at London Heathrow Airport on scheduled flights from China and Singapore. The survey assessed passengers' knowledge of symptoms, actions to take and attitudes towards PHE COVID-19 public health information; interviews explored their views of official public health information and self-isolation. Results In stage II, 121 passengers participated in the survey and 15 in follow-up interviews. 83% of surveyed passengers correctly identified all three COVID-19 associated symptoms listed in PHE information at that time. Most could identify the recommended actions and found the advice understandable and trustworthy. Interviews revealed that passengers shared concerns about the lack of wider official action, and that passengers' knowledge had been acquired elsewhere as much from PHE. Respondents also noted their own agency in choosing to self-isolate, partially as a self-protective measure. Conclusion PHE COVID-19 public health information was perceived as clear and acceptable, but we found that passengers acquired knowledge from various sources and they saw the provision of information alone on arrival as an insufficient official response. Our study provides fresh insights into the importance of taking greater account of diverse information sources and of the need for public assurance in creating public health information materials to address global health threats.

Therefore, the post-lockdown containment of the disease will depend strongly not any more on government-imposed interventions but on personal care measures, taken voluntarily by their citizens. In this respect, recent studies have shed some light regarding the effectiveness individual protection habits may have in preventing SARS-Cov-2 transmission, particularly physical contact distancing, facial mask wearing and hand-washing habits. In this paper we describe experiments performed on a simulated COVID-19 epidemic in an artificial population using an agent based model, so as to illustrate to what extent the interplay between such personal care habits contributes to mitigate the spread of the disease, assuming the lack of other population-wide non-pharmaceutical interventions or vaccines. We discuss scenarios where wide adherence to these voluntary care habits alone, can be enough to contain the unfold of the contagion. Our model purpose is illustrative and contributes to ratify the importance of disseminating the message regarding the collective benefits of mass adoption of personal protection and hygiene habits, as an exit strategy for COVID-19 in the new normal state.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lindsay Alvarez-Pomar","author_inst":"Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas"},{"author_name":"Sergio Rojas-Galeano","author_inst":"Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas"},{"author_name":"Shenghan Cai","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Clare Sawyer","author_inst":"UK Field Epidemiology Training Programme, Global Public Health Division, Public Health England, London, UK; Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, Public Hea"},{"author_name":"Wendy Rice","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology, Field Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Louise E.

There is no clinically automated tool to quantify the infection of COVID-19 patients. Automatic segmentation of lung opacification from computed tomography (CT) images provides excellent potential, which is of great significance for judging the disease development and treatment response of the patients. However, the segmentation of lung opacification from CT slices still faces some challenges, including the complexity and variability features of the opacity regions, the small difference between the infected and healthy tissues, and the noise of CT images. Besides, due to the limited medical resources, it is impractical to obtain a large amount of data in a short time, which further hinders the training of deep learning models. To answer these challenges, we proposed a novel spatial and channel-wise coarse-to-fine attention network (CAT-Net) inspired by the biological vision mechanism, which is for the segmentation of COVID-19 lung opacification from CT Images. CAT-Net has the spatial-wise attention module and the channel-wise attention module to attract the self-attention learning of the network, which serves to extract the practical features at the pixel and channel level successfully. Experiments show that our proposed CAT-Net achieves better results compared to state-of-the-art image segmentation networks.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shixuan Zhao","author_inst":"MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."},{"author_name":"Yongjie Li","author_inst":"MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."},{"author_name":"Zhidan Li","author_inst":"MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."},{"author_name":"Yang Chen","author_inst":"West China Biomedical Big Data Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China."},{"author_name":"Wei Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radi- ology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, No.139 Middle Renmin Road, Changsha, Hunan, China"},{"author_name":"Xie Xingzhi","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, No.139 Middle Renmin Road, Changsha, Hunan, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, No.139 Middle Renmin Road, Changsha, Hunan, China"},{"author_name":"Di Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Rosy Reynolds","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Behavioural Science and Evaluati"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"Health Protection Research Unit in Behavioural Science and Evaluation, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; School of Psychological Scien"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Behavioural Science and Evaluati"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol; Field Epidemiology, Field Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England;"},{"author_name":"Helen Lambert","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Behavioural Science and Evaluati"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Michael Jarvis","author_inst":"University of Plymouth"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Henry M Staines","author_inst":"St George's University of London"},{"author_name":"Lance Turtle","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Divij Mathew","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Oliva Kuthuru","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eileen C.

Vaccines against the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may become available as early as late 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing scenarios in the UK. Methods We used an age-structured dynamic-transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of immunisation programmes over ten years. Assuming vaccines are effective in 5-64 year olds, we compared vaccinating 90% of individuals in this age group to no vaccination. We assumed either vaccine effectiveness of 25% and 1-year protection and 90% re-vaccinated annually, or 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection and 10% re-vaccinated annually. Natural immunity was assumed to last 45 weeks in the base case. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing. We considered benefits from disease prevented in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs to the healthcare payer versus the national economy. We discounted at 3.5% annually and monetised health impact at 20,000 per QALY to obtain the net monetary value, which we explored in sensitivity analyses. Findings Without vaccination and physical distancing, we estimated 147.9 million COVID-19 cases (95% uncertainty interval: 48.5 million, 198.7 million) and 2.8 million (770,000, 4.2 million) deaths in the UK over ten years. Vaccination with 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection may stop community transmission entirely for several years, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic without highly effective vaccines. Introducing vaccination compared to no vaccination leads to economic gains (positive net monetary value) of 0.37 billion to +1.33 billion across all physical distancing and vaccine effectiveness scenarios from the healthcare perspective, but net monetary values of physical distancing scenarios may be negative from societal perspective if the daily national economy losses are persistent and large. Interpretation Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Given uncertainty around both characteristics of the eventually licensed vaccines and long-term COVID-19 epidemiology, our study provides early insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era from an economic and epidemiological perspective.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frank Sandmann","author_inst":"PHE\/LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Davies","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"- Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Anna Vassall","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Jun Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, No.139 Middle Renmin Road, Changsha, Hunan, China"},{"author_name":"Di Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Rosy Reynolds","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Behavioural Science and Evaluati"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"Health Protection Research Unit in Behavioural Science and Evaluation, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; School of Psychological Scien"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Behavioural Science and Evaluati"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol; Field Epidemiology, Field Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England;"},{"author_name":"Helen Lambert","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Behavioural Science and Evaluati"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Michael Jarvis","author_inst":"University of Plymouth"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Henry M Staines","author_inst":"St George's University of London"},{"author_name":"Lance Turtle","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Divij Mathew","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Oliva Kuthuru","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eileen C.

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air and on environmental surfaces around hospitalised patients, with and without respiratory symptoms, was investigated. Environmental sampling was carried out within eight hospitals in England during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Samples were analysed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation assays. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 30 (8.9%) of 336 environmental surfaces. Ct values ranged from 28.8 to 39.1 equating to 2.2 x 105 to 59 genomic copies\/swab. Concomitant bacterial counts were low, suggesting the cleaning performed by nursing and domestic staff across all eight hospitals was effective. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in four of 55 air samples taken < 1 m from four different patients. In all cases, the concentration of viral RNA was low and ranged from < 10 to 460 genomic copies per m3 of air. Infectious virus was not recovered from any of the PCR positive samples analysed. Effective cleaning can reduce the risk of fomite (contact) transmission but some surface types may facilitate the survival, persistence and\/or dispersal of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of low or undetectable concentrations of viral RNA in the air supports current guidance on the use of specific PPE ensembles for aerosol and non-aerosol generating procedures.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ginny Moore","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Helen Rickard","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Stevenson","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Paz Aranega Bou","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"James Pitman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ant Crook","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Katherine Davies","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Antony Spencer","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Chris Burton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Linda Easterbrook","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Hannah E Love","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sian Summers","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Stephen R Welch","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nadina Wand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Katy-Anne Thompson","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Thomas Pottage","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin S Richards","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Allan Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Divij Mathew","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Oliva Kuthuru","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eileen C.
