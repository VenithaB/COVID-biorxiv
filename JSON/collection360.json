UK universities typically host 20,000 to 40,000 undergraduate students, with the majority moving away from home to attend. In the absence of realistic mixing patterns, previous models suggest that outbreaks associated with universities re-opening are an eventuality. Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model based on realistic mixing patterns between students. We evaluated alternative mitigation interventions for a representative university. Results: Our model predicts, for a set of plausible parameter values, that if asymptomatic cases are half as infectious as symptomatic cases then 5,760 (3,940 - 7,430) out of 28,000 students, 20% (14% - 26%), could be infected during the first term, with 950 (656 - 1,209) cases infectious on the last day of term. If asymptomatic cases are as infectious as symptomatic cases then three times as many cases could occur, with 94% (93% - 94%) of the student population getting infected during the first term. We predict that one third of infected students are likely to be in their first year, and first year students are the main drivers of transmission due to high numbers of contacts in communal residences. We find that reducing face-to-face teaching is likely to be the single most effective intervention, and this conclusion is robust to varying assumptions about asymptomatic transmission. Supplementing reduced face-to-face testing with COVID-secure interactions and reduced living circles could reduce the percentage of infected students by 75%. Mass testing of students would need to occur at least fortnightly, is not the most effective option considered, and comes at a cost of high numbers of students requiring self-isolation. When transmission is controlled in the student population, limiting imported infection from the community is important. Conclusions: Priority should be given to understanding the role of asymptomatic transmission in the spread of COVID-19. Irrespective of assumptions about asymptomatic transmission, our findings suggest that additional outbreak control measures should be considered for the university setting. These might include reduced face-to-face teaching, management of student mixing and enhanced testing. Onward transmission to family members at the end of term is likely without interventions.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Hannah Christensen","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Adam Trickey","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Gibran Hemani","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Emily Nixon","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Amy Thomas","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Katy Turner","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Adam Finn","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Matt Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Caroline Relton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.10.20192369","rel_title":"Racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality are driven by unequal infection risks.","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.10.20192369","rel_abs":"Background. As of August 5, 2020, there were more than 4.8M confirmed and probable cases and 159K deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, with these numbers undoubtedly reflecting a significant underestimate of the true toll. Geographic, racial-ethnic, age and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality are key features of the first and second wave of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. Methods. We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race\/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. Findings. In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups other than Native Americans. Of these, Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age- standardized incidence = 1,644\/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 251\/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.6 (95% CI = 5.5, 5.7) and 6.9 (6.5, 7.3) times higher than Whites, respectively. We also found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. Interpretation. This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as the U.S. state of Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates. Funding. This work was supported by a COVID-PODS grant from the Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS) at the University of Michigan. The funding source had no role in the preparation of this manuscript.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jon Zelner","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Rob Trangucci","author_inst":"Dept. of Statistics, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ramya Naraharisetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alex Cao","author_inst":"CSCAR, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ryan Malosh","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kelly Broen","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nina Masters","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Paul Delamater","author_inst":"Dept. of Geography, University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Matt Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Caroline Relton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.20192542","rel_title":"Socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practice toward novel coronavirus among people living in Mosul-Iraq: A cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.20192542","rel_abs":"Background: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a worldwide pandemic, as the Iraqi authorities have started responding and taking action to control the spread of the pandemic. The knowledge and practices of the public play an important role in curbing the spreading of the virus by following the health guidelines. This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practices of Iraqi living in Mosul-Iraq towards novel coronavirus during its rapid rise. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 909 participants was conducted among Mosul-Iraq between 20th June to 1st July 2020. The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) participants' knowledge, 3) participants' practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Results: The results showed knowledge and practice mean score of (12.91\\1.67) and (21.56\\2.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards 2019-nCoV. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice towards the virus as P<0.05. Conclusions: We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of knowledge and practices towards 2019-nCoV except respondents with socio-demographic characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage adequate preventive practice towards 2019-nCoV should be targeted towards this group.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Balsam Qubais","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rula mudhafar Al-Shahrabi","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Obasanjo Afolabi Bolarinwa","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Alex Cao","author_inst":"CSCAR, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ryan Malosh","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kelly Broen","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nina Masters","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Paul Delamater","author_inst":"Dept. of Geography, University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Matt Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Caroline Relton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.293449","rel_title":"Identifying zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between Spike receptor-binding domain and host ACE2","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.293449","rel_abs":"Despite considerable research progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD\/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Huang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Chengxin Zhang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robin Pearce","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Gilbert S Omenn","author_inst":"Univ of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kelly Broen","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nina Masters","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Paul Delamater","author_inst":"Dept. of Geography, University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Matt Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Caroline Relton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.292631","rel_title":"A key linear epitope for a potent neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.292631","rel_abs":"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 confers a serious threat to the public health without effective intervention strategies1-3. Its variant carrying mutated Spike (S) protein D614G (SD614G) has become the most prevalent form in the current global pandemic4,5. We have identified a large panel of potential neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S6. Here, we focused on the top 20 potential NAbs for the mechanism study. Of them, the top 4 NAbs could individually neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SD614G pseudovirus efficiently. Our epitope mapping revealed that 16\/20 potent NAbs overlapped the same steric epitope. Excitingly, we found that one of these potent NAbs (58G6) exclusively bound to a linear epitope on S-RBD (termed as 58G6e), and the interaction of 58G6e and the recombinant ACE2 could be blocked by 58G6. We confirmed that 58G6e represented a key site of vulnerability on S-RBD and it could positively react with COVID-19 convalescent patients plasma. We are the first, as far as we know, to provide direct evidences of a linear epitope that can be recognized by a potent NAb against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. This study paves the way for the applications of these NAbs and the potential safe and effective vaccine design.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tingting

sequence analysis for 47 complete genomes for SARS-CoV-2 isolates on Turkish patients. To identify their genetic similarity, phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequences, selected from GISAID, to the complete genomes from Turkish isolates. In addition, we focused on the variation analysis to show the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 genomes.\n\nMethodsIllumina MiSeq platform was used for sequencing the libraries. The raw reads were aligned to the known SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (v.0.7.1). The phylogenetic tree was constructer using Phylip v.3.6 with Neighbor-Joining and composite likelihood method. The variants were detected by using Genome Analysis Toolkit-HaplotypeCaller v.3.8.0 and were inspected on GenomeBrowse v2.1.2.\n\nResultsAll viral genome sequences of our isolates was located in lineage B under the different clusters such as B.1 (n=3), B.1.1 (n=28), and B.1.9 (n=16). According to the GISAID nomenclature, all our complete genomes were placed in G, GR and GH clades. Five hundred forty-nine total and 53 unique variants were detected. All 47 genomes exhibited different kinds of variants. The distinct variants consist of 274 missense, 225 synonymous, and 50 non-coding alleles.\n\nConclusionThe results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of our isolates have great similarity with all Turkish and European sequences. Further studies should be performed for better comparison of strains, after more complete genome sequences will be released. We also believe that collecting and sharing any data about SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 will be effective and may help the related studies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Murat

To identify host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen four related coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) at two physiologically relevant temperatures (33 {degrees}C and 37 {degrees}C), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution relative to genome scale studies. This approach yielded several new insights, including unexpected virus and temperature specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and GPI anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug development efforts aimed at intercepting and treating COVID-19, and help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSFocused CRISPR screens targeting host factors in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome were performed for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses.\n\nFocused interactome CRISPR screens achieve higher resolution compared to genome-wide screens, leading to the identification of critical factors missed by the latter.\n\nParallel CRISPR screens against multiple coronaviruses uncover host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles.\n\nThe number of host proteins that interact with a viral bait protein is not proportional to the number of functional interactors.\n\nNovel SARS-CoV-2 host factors are expressed in relevant cell types in the human airway.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"H.-Heinrich Hoffmann","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA"},{"author_name":"William M.

between various betacoronavirus strains and their potential human target proteins, such as ACE1, ACE2 and CD26, is critical to our future understanding and combating of COVID-19. Here, employing large replicate sets of GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, we statistically compare atom fluctuations of the known human target proteins in both the presence and absence of different strains of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S spike glycoprotein. We identify a common interaction site between the N-terminal helices of ACE2 and the viral RBD in all strains (hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV1, and SARS-CoV-2) and a second more dynamically complex RBD interaction site involving the ACE2 amino acid sites K353, Q325, and a novel motif, AAQPFLL (386-392) in the more recent cross-species spillovers (i.e. absent in hCoV-OC43). We use computational mutagenesis to further confirm the functional relevance of these sites. We propose a \"one touch\/two touch\" model of viral evolution potentially involved in functionally facilitating binding interactions in zoonotic spillovers. We also observe these two touch sites governing RBD binding activity in simulations on hybrid models of the suspected viral progenitor, batCoV-HKU4, interacting with both the human SARS target, ACE2, and the human MERS target, CD26. Lastly, we confirm that the presence of a common hypertension drug (lisinopril) within the target site of SARS-CoV-2 bound models of ACE1 and ACE2 acts to enhance the RBD interactions at the same key sites in our proposed model. In the near future, we recommend that our comparative computational analysis identifying these key viral RBD-ACE2 binding interactions be supplemented with comparative studies of site-directed mutagenesis in order to screen for current and future coronavirus strains at high risk of zoonotic transmission to humans.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe generated structural models of the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain from recent and past betacoronavirus outbreak strains aligned to the angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 protein, the primary target protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID 19. We then statistically compared computer simulated molecular dynamics of viral bound and unbound versions of each model to identify locations where interactions with each viral strain have dampened the atom fluctuations during viral binding. We demonstrate that all known strains of betacoronavirus are strongly interactive with the N-terminal helix region of ACE2. We also identify a more complex viral interaction with three novel sites that associates with more recent and deadly SARS strains, and also a bat progenitor strain HKU4.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick X.

Recently, the cryo-EM structure in complex with 40S ribosome is deciphered. However, the structure of full length NSP1 without any partner has not been studies. Also, the conformation of NSP1-C terminal region in isolation is not been studied. In this study, we have investigated the conformational dynamics of NSP1C-terminal region (NSP1-CTR; amino acids 130-180) in isolation and under different solvent environments. The NSP1-CTR is found to be intrinsically disordered in aqueous solution. Further, we used alpha helix inducer, trifluoroethanol, and found induction of alpha helical conformation using CD spectroscopy. Additionally, in the presence of SDS, NSP1-CTR is showing a conformational change from disordered to ordered, possibly gaining alpha helix in part. But in presence of neutral lipid DOPC, a slight change in conformation is observed. This implies the possible role of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction on the conformational changes of NSP1. The changes in structural conformation were further studied by fluorescence-based studies, which showed significant blue shift and fluorescence quenching in the presence of SDS and TFE. Lipid vesicles also showed fluorescence-based quenching. In agreement to these result, fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy decay suggests a change in conformational dynamics. The zeta potential studies further validated that the conformational dynamics is mostly because of hydrophobic interaction. In last, these experimental studies were complemented through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation which have also shown a good correlation and testify our experiments. We believe that the intrinsically disordered nature of the NSP1-CTR will have implications in disorder based binding promiscuity with its interacting proteins.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amit Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Ankur Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of

Results: TB prevalence is associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality and malaria have an additional effect in reducing COVID-19 mortality. The results show with robust statistical support that TB prevalence was also associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality with additional effect that is also observed in TB and BCG coverage rate.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus spreading across the world causing the disease COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is done by quantitative reverse-transcription polymer chain reaction (qRT-PCR) testing which utilizes different primer-probe sets depending on the assay used. Using in silico analysis we aimed to determine how the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the interaction between the reverse primer during qRT-PCR and how it relates to the experimental primer-probe test efficiencies. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex Interaction of Nucleic acids with pseudoKnots) that follows the hierarchical folding hypothesis to predict the secondary structure of two interacting nucleic acid strands (DNA\/RNA) of similar or different type. DinoKnot is the first program that utilizes stable stems in both strands as a guide to find the structure of their interaction. Using DinoKnot we predicted the interaction of the reverse primers used in four common COVID-19 qRT-PCR tests with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In addition, we predicted how 12 mutations in the primer\/probe binding region may affect the primer\/probe ability and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 detection. While we found all reverse primers are capable of interacting with their target area, we identified partial mismatching between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and some reverse primers. We predicted three mutations that may prevent primer binding, reducing the ability for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We believe our contributions can aid in the design of a more sensitive SARS-CoV-2 test.\n\nAuthor summaryThe current testing for the disease COVID-19 that is caused by the novel cornonavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses oligonucleotides called primers that bind to specific target regions on the SARS-CoV-2 genome to detect the virus. Our goal was to use computational tools to predict how the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the ability of the primers to bind to their target region. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex interaction of nucleic acids with pseudoknots) that is able to predict the interactions between two DNA or RNA molecules. We used DinoKnot to predict the efficiency of four common COVID-19 tests, and the effect of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus on ability of the COVID-19 tests in detecting those strains. We predict partial mismatching between some primers and the SARS-CoV-2 genome but that all primers are capable of interacting with their target areas. We also predict three mutations that prevent primer binding and thus SARS-CoV-2 detection. We discuss the limitations of the current COVID-19 testing and suggest the design of a more sensitive COVID-19 test that can be aided by our findings.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tara Newman","author_inst":"University of Victoria Faculty of Engineering: University of Victoria Faculty of Engineering & Computer

initial supply will raise the question of how to prioritize the available doses and thus underscores the need for transparent, evidence-based strategies that relate knowledge of, and uncertainty in, disease transmission, risk, vaccine efficacy, and existing population immunity. Here, we employ a model-informed approach to vaccine prioritization that evaluates the impact of prioritization strategies on cumulative incidence and mortality and accounts for population factors such as age, contact structure, and seroprevalence, and vaccine factors including imperfect and age-varying efficacy. This framework can be used to evaluate and compare existing strategies, and it can also be used to derive an optimal prioritization strategy to minimize mortality or incidence. We find that a transmission-blocking vaccine should be prioritized to adults ages 20-49y to minimize cumulative incidence and to adults over 60y to minimize mortality. Direct vaccination of adults over 60y minimizes mortality for vaccines that do not block transmission. We also estimate the potential benefit of using individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to only seronegative individuals, improving the marginal impact of each dose. We argue that this serology-informed vaccination approach may improve the efficiency of vaccination efforts while partially addressing existing inequities in COVID-19 burden and impact.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kate M Bubar","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

We report that the average days from entry to confirmation is 7.7, 5.0 and 4.7 days for travelers from China, Italy, and Iran respectively. Approximately, one-third of all exported cases were confirmed within 3 days of entry suggesting these travelers were mildly symptomatic or symptomatic in arrival. We also found that earlier exported cases from each country had a longer time between entry to confirmation by an average of 3 days compared to later exports. Based upon our data, reported exported cases from South Korea were far fewer in comparison to those from China, Italy and Iran. Therefore, we suggest that careful monitoring of likely symptomatic travelers and better public awareness may lead to faster confirmation as well as reduced transmission of COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed Tamer Soliman","author_inst":"Case-Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics"},{"author_name":"Michael

Study","rel_date":"2020-09-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190975","rel_abs":"INTRODUCTION: Increased vitamin D levels, as reflected by 25OHD measurements, has been proposed to protect against Covid-19 disease based on in-vitro, observational, and ecological studies. However, vitamin D levels are associated with many confounding variables and thus associations described to date may not be causal. Vitamin D MR studies have provided results that are concordant with large-scale vitamin D randomized trials. Here, we used two-sample MR to assess the effect of circulating 25OHD levels on Covid-19 susceptibility. METHODS: Genetic variants strongly associated with 25OHD levels in a 443,734-participant genome-wide association study (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables. GWASs of Covid-19 susceptibility and severity from the Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative were used to test the effect of 25OHD levels on these outcomes. Cohorts from the Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS included up to 966,395 individuals of European ancestry. RESULTS: Genetically increased 25OHD levels by one standard deviation on the logarithmic scale had no clear effect on susceptibility but tended to increase the odds ratio of hospitalization (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.33, 4.11) and severe disease (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 0.87, 5.55). Extensive sensitivity analyses probing the assumptions of MR provided consistent estimates. CONCLUSION: These findings do not support a protective role of increased 25OHD levels on Covid-19 outcomes and may suggest harm. At present, individuals should not use vitamin D supplements to protect against Covid-19 outcomes, and on-going supplementation trials should closely monitor for signals of harm.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guillaume Butler-Laporte","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Tomoko Nakanishi","author_inst":"McGill

susceptibility has limited the role of the climate in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to date. However, understanding a possible future effect of climate, as susceptibility declines and the northern-hemisphere winter approaches, is an important open question. Here we use an epidemiological model, constrained by observations, to assess the sensitivity of future SARS-CoV-2 disease trajectories to local climate conditions. We find this sensitivity depends on both the susceptibility of the population and the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical controls (NPIs) in reducing transmission. Assuming high susceptibility, more stringent NPIs may be required to minimize outbreak risk in the winter months. Our results imply a role for meteorological forecasts in projecting outbreak severity, however, reducing uncertainty in epidemiological parameters will likely have a greater impact on generating accurate predictions and reflects the strong leverage of NPIs on future outbreak severity.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel E.

In the face of significant uncertainty around the epidemic impact of in-person schooling, policymakers, parents, and teachers are weighing the risks and benefits of returning to in-person education. In this context, we examined the impact of different school reopening scenarios on transmission within and outside of schools and on the share of school days that would need to be spent learning at a distance. Methods: We used an agent-based mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and interventions to quantify the impact of school reopening on disease transmission and the extent to which school-based interventions could mitigate epidemic spread within and outside schools. We compared seven school reopening strategies that vary the degree of countermeasures within schools to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, including the use of face masks, physical distancing, classroom cohorting, screening, testing, and contact tracing, as well as schedule changes to reduce the number of students in school. We considered three scenarios for the size of the epidemic in the two weeks prior to school reopening: 20, 50, or 110 detected cases per 100,000 individuals and assumed the epidemic was slowly declining with full school closures. For each scenario, we calculated the percentage of schools that would have at least one person arriving at school with an active COVID-19 infection on the first day of school; the percentage of in-person school days that would be lost due to scheduled distance learning, symptomatic screening or quarantine; the cumulative infection rate for students, staff and teachers over the first three months of school; and the effective reproduction number averaged over the first three months of school within the community. Findings: In-person schooling poses significant risks to students, teachers, and staff. On the first day of school, 5-42% of schools would have at least one person arrive at school with active COVID-19, depending on the incidence of COVID in the community and the school type. However, reducing class sizes via A\/B school scheduling, combined with an incremental approach that returns elementary schools in person and keeps all other students remote, can mitigate COVID transmission. In the absence of any countermeasures in schools, we expect 6-25% of teaching and non-teaching staff and 4-20% of students to be infected with COVID in the first three months of school, depending upon the case detection rate. Schools can lower this risk to as low as 0.2% for staff and 0.1% for students by returning elementary schools with a hybrid schedule while all other grades continue learning remotely. However, this approach would require 60-85% of all school days to be spent at home. Despite the significant risks to the school population, reopening schools would not significantly increase community-wide transmission, provided sufficient countermeasures are implemented in schools. Interpretation: Without extensive countermeasures, school reopening may lead to an increase in infections and a significant number of re-closures as cases are identified among staff and students. Returning elementary schools only with A\/B scheduling is the lowest risk school reopening strategy that includes some in-person learning.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jamie A.

Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted among 1,021 RT-PCR confirmed but recovered COVID-19 cases from six participating hospitals in Bangladesh. Results: Of the total sample, 111 (10.9%) cases were asymptomatic while the number of symptomatic cases were 910 (89.1%). Higher prevalence of COVID-19 persisted in the male population (75%) and for the 31-40 age group. More than 85% of the samples reported BCG vaccination mark. Common symptoms observed in our study samples were fever (72.4%), cough (55.9%), loss of taste (40.7%) and body ache (40%); whereas for the biochemical parameters, Neutrophil (46.4%), D-dimer (46.1%), Ferritin (37.9%) and SGPT (36.8%) levels were found elevated. Post-COVID complications including pain (31.8%), loss of concentration (24.4%) and anxiety or depression (23.1%) were found significantly prevalent. Conclusion: Our study has shown that adult males aged between 31-40 in Bangladesh are more vulnerable to being infected with COVID-19. With an indication for the rising trend of the asymptomatic cases, deployment of interventions to curb further community spread is necessary to avoid the grave outcomes of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adnan Mannan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chattogram-4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"H.M.

than 300 SARS-COV-2 serological tests have recently been developed using either the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), the spike glycoprotein subunit (S1), and more recently the receptor binding domain (RBD). Most of the assays report very good clinical performance characteristics in well-controlled clinical settings. However, there is a growing belief that good performance characteristics that are obtained during clinical performance trials might not be sufficient to deliver good diagnostic results in population-wide screens that are usually characterized with low seroprevalence. In this paper, we developed a serological assay against N, S1 and RBD using a bead-based multiplex platform and a rules-based computational approach to assess the performance of single and multi-antigen readouts in well-defined clinical samples and in a population-wide serosurvey from blood donors. Even though assays based on single antigen readouts performed similarly well in the clinical samples, there was a striking difference between the antigens on the population-wide screen. Asymptomatic individuals with low antibody titers and sub-optimal assay specificity might contribute to the large discrepancies in population studies with low seroprevalence. A multi-antigen assay requiring partial agreement between RBD, N and S1 readouts exhibited enhanced specificity, less dependency on assay cut-off values and an overall more robust performance in both sample settings. Our data suggest that assays based on multiple antigen readouts combined with a rules-based computational consensus can provide a more robust platform for routine antibody screening.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christos F Fotis","author_inst":"Biomedical Systems Laboratory, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Meimetis","author_inst":"Biomedical Systems Laboratory, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Nikos Tsolakos","author_inst":"ProtATonce Ltd"},{"author_name":"Marianna Politou","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Therapeutics, Alexandra General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Karolina Akinosoglou","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vicky Pliaka","author_inst":"ProtATonce Ltd,"},{"author_name":"Angeliki Minia","author_inst":"ProtATonce Ltd"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Terpos","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Therapeutics, Alexandra General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Ioannis P.

Methods: To identify intermediate traits of the COVID-19 risk variant, we performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with 923 phenotypes in 310,999 European individuals from UK Biobank. For candidate target genes, we examined associations between their expression and the polygenic score (PGS) of 1,263 complex traits in a meta-analysis of 31,684 blood samples. Results: Our PheWAS identified and replicated multiple blood cell traits to be associated with the COVID-19 risk variant, including monocyte count and percentage (p = 1.07e-8, 4.09e-13), eosinophil count and percentage (p = 5.73e-3, 2.20e-3), and neutrophil percentage (p = 3.23e-3). The PGS analysis revealed positive associations between the expression of candidate genes and genetically predicted counts of specific blood cells: CCR3 with eosinophil and basophil (p = 5.73e-21, 5.08e-19); CCR2 with monocytes (p = 2.40e-10); and CCR1 with monocytes and neutrophil (p = 1.78e-6, 7.17e-5).

Design: This observational study was a secondary data analysis of publicly available data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TBDJ). Data were downloaded and analyzed on July 24, 2020. This project was completed in collaboration with the COVID Prison Project. Setting: One-hundred and three prisons in the state of Texas. Participants: The unit of analysis is the individual prison units that comprise the TDCJ. Exposures: None Main Outcomes and Measures: Latent profiles on levels of incarcerated resident COVID-19 cases, staff COVID-19 cases, and incarcerated resident COVID-19 deaths. Results: We identified relevant profiles from the data: a low outbreak profile, a high outbreak profile, and a high death profile. Additionally, current prison population and level of employee staffing predicted membership in the high outbreak and high death profiles when compared to the low outbreak profile. Conclusions and Relevance: Housing persons at 85% of prison capacity may minimize the risk of infection and death related to COVID-19. Implementing this 85% standard as an absolute minimum should be prioritized at prisons across the US.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noel A.

Methods: Five databases were screened from inception to 27-Aug-2020. The effects of specific drug interventions on safety and efficacy were assessed in COVID-19 patients. Risk Ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results: A total of 10 studies were identified which fulfill the inclusion criteria. Patients taking antivirals had 26% less risk of having a severe adverse event (SAE) compared to controls (RR, 0.74, CI:0.62 to 0.89, P=0.002). Clinical improvement at day 14 was observed among the cases treated with antivirals compared to the control group (RR 1.24, CI: 1.00 to 1.53 p=0.05). Conclusion: There is evidence that Remdesivir and LPV\/r reduces the hospital length of stay and that patients to which antivirals were administered had less SAE and improvement when compared to patients not prescribed with antivirals. Due to a lack of power and the quality of the studies, it was not possible to determine which antivirals have a greater risk-benefit balance, and therefore the optimal approach to antiviral treatment is still uncertain.

With the outbreak of the epidemic, many researchers are devoting themselves to the COVID-19 screening system. The standard practices for rapid risk screening of COVID-19 are the CT imaging or RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction). However, these methods demand professional efforts of the acquisition of CT images and saliva samples, a certain amount of waiting time, and most importantly prohibitive examination fee in some countries. Recently, some literatures have shown that the COVID-19 patients usually accompanied by ocular manifestations consistent with the conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. After more than four months study, we found that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 present the consistent ocular pathological symbols; and we propose a new screening method of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras, could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with very high accuracy. We believe a system implementing such an algorithm should assist the triage management or the clinical diagnosis. To further evaluate our algorithm and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai public health clinic center of Fudan University, we conduct a study of analyzing the eye-region images of 303 patients (104 COVID-19, 131 pulmonary, and 68 ocular patients), as well as 136 healthy people. Remarkably, our results of COVID-19 patients in testing set consistently present similar ocular pathological symbols; and very high testing results have been achieved in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We hope this study can be inspiring and helpful for encouraging more researches in this topic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yanwei Fu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenxuan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Haicheng Tang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xuelin Qian","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Mengwei Gu","author_inst":"AIMOMICS"},{"author_name":"Xiangyang Xue","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Terpos","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Therapeutics, Alexandra General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Ioannis P.

Animal studies and the scarcity of confirmed re-infection suggests immune protection is likely, although the durability of this protection is debated. Lasting immunity following acute viral infection requires maintenance of both serum antibody and antigen-specific memory B and T lymphocytes and is notoriously pathogen specific, ranging from life-long for smallpox or measles4, to highly transient for common cold coronaviruses (CCC). Neutralising antibody responses are a likely correlate of protective immunity and exclusively recognise the viral spike (S) protein, predominantly targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S1 sub-domain. Multiple reports describe waning of S-specific antibodies in the first 2-3 months following infection. However, extrapolation of early linear trends in decay might be overly pessimistic, with several groups reporting that serum neutralisation is stable over time in a proportion of convalescent subjects. While SARS-CoV-2 specific B and T cell responses are readily induced by infection, the longitudinal dynamics of these key memory populations remains poorly resolved. Here we comprehensively profiled antibody, B and T cell dynamics over time in a cohort recovered from mild-moderate COVID-19. We find that binding and neutralising antibody responses, together with individual serum clonotypes, decay over the first 4 months post-infection, as expected, with a similar decline in S-specific CD4+ and circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) frequencies. In contrast, S-specific IgG+ memory B cells (MBC) consistently accumulate over time, eventually comprising a significant fraction of circulating MBC. Modelling of the concomitant immune kinetics predicts maintenance of serological neutralising activity above a titre of 1:40 in 50% of convalescent subjects to 74 days, with probable additive protection from B and T cells. Overall, our study suggests SARS-CoV-2 immunity after infection is likely to be transiently protective at a population level. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may require greater immunogenicity and durability than natural infection to drive long-term protection.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam K

transmitted in human environments has triggered avoidance of interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We define a metric, Effective ReBreathed Volume (ERBV), that encapsulates how infectious pathogens transport in air. This measure distinguishes environmental transport from other factors in the chain of infection, thus allowing quantitative comparisons of the riskiness of different situations for any pathogens transported in air, including SARS-CoV-2. Particle size is a key factor in transport, removal onto surfaces, and elimination by mitigation measures, so ERBV is presented for a range of exhaled particle diameters: 1 m, 10 m, and 100 m. Pathogen transport is enhanced by two separate but interacting effects: proximity and confinement. Confinement in enclosed spaces overwhelms proximity after 10-15 minutes for all but the largest particles. Therefore, we review plausible strategies to reduce the confinement effect. Changes in standard ventilation and filtration can reduce person-to-person transport of 1-m particles (ERBV1) by 13-85% in residential and commercial situations. Deposition to surfaces competes with intentional removal for 10-m and 100-m particles, so the same interventions reduce ERBV10 by only 3-50%, and ERBV100 is unaffected. Determining transmission modes is critical to identify intervention effectiveness, and would be accelerated with prior knowledge of ERBV. When judiciously selected, the interventions examined can provide substantial reduction in risk, and the conditions for selection are identified. The framework of size-dependent ERBV supports analysis and mitigation decisions in an emerging situation, even before other infectious parameters are well known.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tami C.

As countries across the world loosen their lockdown restrictions, the assumption is generally made that the risk of COVID-19 transmission is lower outdoors, and this assumption has shaped decisions about what activities can re-commence, the circumstances in which they should re-commence, and the conditions under which they should re-commence. This is important for events and activities that generate outdoor gatherings of people, including both participatory and spectator sport events, protests, concerts, carnivals, festivals, and other celebrations. The review, which was designed to be undertaken rapidly in 15 days, returned 14 sources of evidence of outdoor transmission of COVID-19, and a further 21 sources that were used to set the context and understand the caveats that should be considered in interpreting the review findings. The review found very few examples of outdoor transmission of COVID-19 in everyday life among c. 25,000 cases considered, suggesting a very low risk. However risk of outdoor transmission increases when the natural social distancing of everyday life is breached, and gathering density, circulation and size increases, particularly for an extended duration. There was also evidence that weather had a behavioural effect on transmission, with temperatures that encourage outdoor activity associated with lower COVID-19 transmission. Due to lack of surveillance and tracing systems, and confounding factors and variables, there was no evidence that robustly tested transmission at outdoor mass gatherings (circa 10,000+ people), which are as likely to generate transmission from the activities they prompt (e.g. communal travel and congregation in bars) as from outdoor transmission at the gathering itself. The goal of hosts and organisers of events and activities that generate outdoor gatherings of people is to prevent the escalation of risk from sporadic transmission to the risk of transmission through a cluster outbreak. Considerations for such hosts and organisers include: (1) does the gathering prompt other behaviours that might increase transmission risk?; (2) for each part of the event or activity, how dense is the gathering, how much do people circulate, how large is the gathering, and how long are people there?; (3) is rapid contact tracing possible in the event of an outbreak? These considerations should take place relevant to the size of the underlying risk, which includes the rate of infection in the community and the likely attendance of vulnerable groups. Risk must be balanced and mitigated across the risk factors of density, circulation, size and duration. No one risk factor presents an inherently larger risk than any other, but neither is any one risk factor a magic bullet to eliminate risk. Finally, it is clear that the largest risks from gatherings come from spontaneous or informal unregulated and unmitigated events or activities which do not consider any of the issues, risks and risk factors outlined in this paper","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mike Weed","author_inst":"Canterbury Christ Church University"},{"author_name":"Abby Foad","author_inst":"Canterbury Christ Church University"},{"author_name":"Delphine K.

At that stage, containment measures were put in place. The health authority in Qatar developed an emergency action plan to respond to the outbreak with the Primary Health Care as the main component of that response and suspended all non-urgent services including preventive health services. The aim of the retrospective analysis to measure the Impact of COVID 19 on the preventive services provided in Qatar. Methods: A retrospective data analysis was conducted for all the preventive services utilization volume across the 27 PHCC health centers from the 1st of January 2017 to the 31st of July 2020. Results: With 17,012 no-show appointments, well-baby and Immunization services utilization demonstrated a reduction of 40% in May and started to come back to volumes higher than expected in June. The number of cancelled appointments for breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening programs were 3,481 and 5,854 respectively. The expected volumes demand has dropped by 100% in comparison to 2017 demand. Wellness services only met 20% of its projected utilization in April, however, the services picked up in June. Conclusion: These findings will guide the public health policymakers to understand the effects COVID-19 on preventive services and the risk of having an increased number of outbreaks for childhood communicable disease, cancer cases with delayed diagnosis due to the screening services suspension. In addition, the plan will address the increased number of sedately behavior due to the service's reduced utilization of wellness services.
