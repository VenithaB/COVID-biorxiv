We undertook a literature review of published studies\/data on detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in contacts of COVID-19 cases, as well as serological studies, and studies of infections in the school setting to examine those issues. Results: Our literature review presents evidence for significantly lower susceptibility to infection for children aged under 10 years compared to adults given the same exposure, for elevated susceptibility to infection in adults aged over 60y compared to younger\/middle aged adults, and for the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with sleeping close to an infected individual. Published serological studies also suggest that younger adults (particularly those aged under 35y) often have high cumulative rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. Additionally, there is some evidence of robust spread of SARS-CoV-2 in secondary\/high schools, and there appears to be more limited spread in primary schools. Some countries with relatively large class sizes in primary schools (e.g. Chile and Israel) reported sizeable outbreaks in some of those schools, though routes of transmission of infection to both students and staff are not clear from current reports. Conclusions: Opening secondary\/high schools is likely to contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and, if implemented, it should require both lower levels of community transmission and greater safeguards to reduce transmission. Compared to secondary\/high schools, opening primary schools and daycare facilities may have a more limited effect on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community, particularly under smaller class sizes and in the presence of mitigation measures. Efforts to avoid crowding in the classroom and other mitigation measures should be implemented, to the extent possible, when opening primary schools. Efforts should be undertaken to diminish the mixing in younger adults to mitigate the spread of the epidemic in the whole community.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward Goldstein","author_inst":"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

By using several experimental approaches, we investigated the potential association between SARS-CoV-2 IgGs recognizing the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) targeting S, and COVID-19 severity. Patients and Methods: This unicenter, retrospective, observational study included 51 hospitalized patients (24 at the intensive care unit; ICU). A total of 93 sera from these patients collected at different time points from the onset of symptoms were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgGs were quantitated by ELISA and NtAb50 titers were measured in a GFP reporter-based pseudotyped virus platform. Demographic and clinical data, complete blood counts, as well as serum levels of ferritin, Dimer-D, C reactive protein (CRP), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were retrieved from clinical charts. Results: The overall correlation between levels of both antibody measurements was good (Rho=0.79; P=0<0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG and NtAb50 levels in sera collected up to day 30 after the onset of symptoms were comparable between ICU and non-ICU patients (P=>0.1). The percentage of patients who exhibited high NtAb50 titers ([&ge;]160) was similar (P=0.20) in ICU (79%) and non-ICU (60%) patients. Four ICU patients died; two of these achieved NtAb50 titers [&ge;]1\/160 while the other two exhibited a 1\/80 titer. Very weak (Rho=>0.0-<0.2) or weak (Rho=>0.2-<0.4) correlations were observed between anti-RBD IgGs, NtAb50, and serum levels pro-inflammatory biomarkers.

Molecular docking and binding energetics studies revealed strong interactions of the vaccine with immune-stimulatory toll-like receptors (TLR) -2, 3, 4. Molecular dynamics simulation of the vaccine ensured in vivo stability in the biological system. The immune simulation of vaccine evinced elevated immune response.

Using Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics to enhance sampling of conformational space, we identified cryptic pockets within the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including some within regions far from the active site and assed their druggability.

Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing in peripheral blood samples of five healthy donors and 13 COVID-19 patients including moderate, severe and convalescent cases. Through determining the transcriptional profiles of immune cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor and B cell receptor sequences, we analyzed the functional properties of immune cells. Most cell types in COVID-19 patients showed a strong interferon-alpha response, and an overall acute inflammatory response. Moreover, intensive expansion of highly cytotoxic effector T cell subsets, such as CD4+ Effector-GNLY (Granulysin), CD8+ Effector-GNLY and NKT CD160, was associated with convalescence in moderate patients. In severe patients, the immune landscape featured a deranged interferon response, profound immune exhaustion with skewed T cell receptor repertoire and broad T cell expansion. These findings illustrate the dynamic nature of immune responses during the disease progression.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fu-Sheng Wang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ji-Yuan Zhang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiangming Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xudong Xing","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhe Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Zhang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin-Wen Song","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xing Fan","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Xia","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun-Liang Fu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Si-Yu Wang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.217570","rel_title":"Adopting STING agonist cyclic dinucleotides as a potential adjuvant for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.217570","rel_abs":"A novel STING agonist CDGSF unilaterally modified with phosphorothioate and fluorine was synthesized.

Thanks to the scientific communitys unprecedented efforts, the atomic structure of several viral proteins has been promptly resolved. As the crucial mediator of host cell infection, the heavily glycosylated trimeric viral Spike protein (S) has been attracting the most attention and is at the center of efforts to develop antivirals, vaccines, and diagnostic solutions.\n\nHerein, we use an energy-decomposition approach to identify antigenic domains and antibody binding sites on the fully glycosylated S protein. Crucially, all that is required by our method are unbiased atomistic molecular dynamics simulations; no prior knowledge of binding properties or ad hoc combinations of parameters\/measures extracted from simulations is needed. Our method simply exploits the analysis of energy interactions between all intra-protomer aminoacid and monosaccharide residue pairs, and cross-compares them with structural information (i.e., residueresidue proximity), identifying potential immunogenic regions as those groups of spatially contiguous residues with poor energetic coupling to the rest of the protein.\n\nOur results are validated by several experimentally confirmed structures of the S protein in complex with anti- or nanobodies. We identify poorly coupled sub-domains: on the one hand this indicates their role in hosting (several) epitopes, and on the other hand indicates their involvement in large functional conformational transitions. Finally, we detect two distinct behaviors of the glycan shield: glycans with stronger energetic coupling are structurally relevant and protect underlying peptidic epitopes; those with weaker coupling could themselves be poised for antibody recognition. Predicted Immunoreactive regions can be used to develop optimized antigens (recombinant subdomains, synthetic (glyco)peptidomimetics) for therapeutic applications.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefano Serapian","author_inst":"University of Pavia, Department of Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Filippo Marchetti","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Alice Triveri","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Giulia Morra","author_inst":"SCITEC-CNR"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Meli","author_inst":"SCITEC-CNR"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Moroni","author_inst":"SCITEC-CNR"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe A Sautto","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rasola","author_inst":"University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Colombo","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Jun-Liang Fu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Si-Yu Wang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.217562","rel_title":"Identification, Mapping and Relative Quantitation of SARS-Cov2 Spike Glycopeptides by Mass-Retention Time Fingerprinting","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.217562","rel_abs":"We describe a novel analytical method for rapid and robust identification, mapping and relative quantitation of glycopeptides from SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The method may be executed using any LC-TOF mass spectrometer, requires no specialised knowledge of glycan analysis and makes use of the differential resolving power of reversed phase HPLC. While this separation technique resolves peptides with high efficiency, glycans are resolved poorly, if at all. Consequently, glycopeptides consisting of the same peptide bearing different glycan structures will all possess very similar retention times and co-elute. While this has previously been viewed as a disadvantage, we show that shared retention time can be used to map multiple glycan species to the same peptide and location. In combination with MSMS and pseudo MS3, we have constructed a detailed mass-retention time database for Spike. This database allows any ESI-TOF equipped lab to reliably identify and quantify spike glycans from a single overnight elastase protein digest in less than 90 minutes.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rod Chalk","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"William Greenland","author_inst":"Agilent Technologies, Lakeside, Cheadle Royal Business Park, Cheadle, Cheshire, SK8 3GR, UK"},{"author_name":"Tiago Moreira","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Jesse Coker","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Shubhashish Mukhopadhyay","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Williams","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Manning","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Tina Bohstedt","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Rama McCrorie","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Alejandra Fernandez-Cid","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicola A Burgess-Brown","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.219139","rel_title":"Tissue-specific and interferon-inducible expression of non-functional ACE2 through endogenous retrovirus co-option","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.219139","rel_abs":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an entry receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as a regulator of several physiological processes.

In the absence of effective vaccine, different countries have employed various other types of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of this disease, including quarantines and lockdowns, tracking, tracing and isolation of infected individuals, and social distancing measures. Effectiveness of these and other measures of disease containment and prevention to a large degree depends on good understanding of disease dynamics, and robust mathematical models play an important role for forecasting its future dynamics. In this paper we focus on Ukraine, one of Europe's largest countries, and develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 dynamics, using latest data on parameters characterising clinical features of disease. For improved accuracy, our model includes age-stratified disease parameters, as well as age- and location-specific contact matrices to represent contacts. We show that the model is able to provide an accurate short-term forecast for the numbers and age distribution of cases and deaths. We also simulated different lockdown scenarios, and the results suggest that reducing work contacts is more efficient at reducing the disease burden than reducing school contacts, or implementing shielding for people over 60.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuliya Kyrychko","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Konstantin Blyuss","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Igor Brovchenko","author_inst":"Institute of Mathematical Machine and System Problems"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Eyras","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Hardip R.

Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected and removed from the susceptible subpopulation earlier. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold is reached. Here we fit epidemiological models with inbuilt distributions of susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks to estimate basic reproduction numbers (R0) alongside coefficients of individual variation (CV) and the effects of containment strategies. Herd immunity thresholds are then calculated as 1-(1\/R0)1\/(1+CV2) or 1-(1\/R0)1\/(1+2CV2), depending on whether variation is on susceptibility or exposure. Our inferences result in herd immunity thresholds around 10-20%, considerably lower than the minimum coverage needed to interrupt transmission by random vaccination, which for R0 higher than 2.5 is estimated above 60%. We emphasize that the classical formula, 1-(1\/R0), remains applicable to describe herd immunity thresholds for random vaccination, but not for immunity induced by infection which is naturally selective. These findings have profound consequences for the governance of the current pandemic given that some populations may be close to achieving herd immunity despite being under more or less strict social distancing measures.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Aguas","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo M.

Due to high transmission levels, many governments implemented social-distancing measures and confinement with different levels of required compliance to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. In several countries, these measures were effective, and it was possible to flatten the epidemic curve and control it. In others, this objective was not or has not been achieved. In far to many cities around the world rebounds of the epidemic are occurring or, in others, plateau-like states have appeared where high incidence rates remain constant for relatively long periods of time. Nonetheless, faced with the challenge of urgent social need to reactivate their economies, many countries have decided to lift mitigation measures at times of high incidence. In this paper, we use a mathematical model to characterize the impact of short duration transmission events within the confinement period previous but close to the epidemic peak. The model describes too, the possible consequences on the disease dynamics after mitigation measures are lifted. We use Mexico City as a case study. The results show that events of high mobility may produce either a later higher peak, a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence or the same peak as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay. Finally, we also show the importance of carefully timing the lifting of mitigation measures. If this occurs during a period of high incidence, then the disease transmission will rapidly increase, unless the effective contact rate keeps decreasing, which will be very difficult to achieve once the population is released.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Santana-Cibrian","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Manuel A.

We used a simulation model of air travellers arriving to the UK from the EU or the USA and the timing of their stages of infection to evaluate the ability of these strategies to reduce the risk of seeding community transmission. We find that a quarantine period of 8 days on arrival with a PCR test on day 7 (with a 1-day delay for test results) can reduce the number of infectious arrivals released into the community by a median 94% compared to a no quarantine, no test scenario. This reduction is similar to that achieved by a 14-day quarantine period (median 99% reduction). Shorter quarantine periods still can prevent a substantial amount of transmission; all strategies in which travellers spend at least 5 days (the mean incubation period) in quarantine and have at least one negative test before release are highly effective (e.g. a test on day 5 with release on day 6 results in a median 88% reduction in transmission potential). Without intervention, the current high prevalence in the US (40 per 10,000) results in a higher expected number of infectious arrivals per week (up to 23) compared to the EU (up to 12), despite an estimated 8 times lower volume of travel in July 2020. Requiring a 14-day quarantine period likely results in less than 1 infectious traveller each entering the UK per week from the EU and the USA (97.5th percentile). We also find that on arrival the transmission risk is highest from pre-symptomatic travellers; quarantine policies will shift this risk increasingly towards asymptomatic infections if eventually-symptomatic individuals self-isolate after the onset of symptoms. As passenger numbers recover, strategies to reduce the risk of re-introduction should be evaluated in the context of domestic SARS-CoV-2 incidence, preparedness to manage new outbreaks, and the economic and psychological impacts of quarantine.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Clifford","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Billy J Quilty","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yung-Wai Desmond Chan","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akira Endo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20160994","rel_title":"Country distancing reveals the effectiveness of travel restrictions during COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20160994","rel_abs":"Travel restrictions are the current central strategy to globally stop the transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Despite remarkably successful approaches in predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of the ongoing pandemic, we lack an intrinsic understanding of the travel restriction's effectiveness. We fill this gap by developing a surprisingly simple measure, country distancing, that is analogical to the effective resistance in series and parallel circuits and captures the propagation backbone tree from the outbreak locations globally. This approach enables us to map the effectiveness of travel restrictions to arrival time delay (ATD) or infected case reduction (ICR) systematically. Our method estimates that 50.8\\% of travel restrictions as of Apr-4 are ineffective, resulting in zero ATD or ICR worldwide. Instead, by imposing Hubei's lockdown on Jan-23 and national lockdown on Feb-8, mainland China alone leads to 11.66 [95\\% credible interval (CI), 9.71 to 13.92] days of ATD per geographic area and 1,012,233 (95\\% CI, 208,210 -4,959,094) ICR in total as of Apr-4.

Aims: To examine the factors associated with psychological distress among HCW during an outbreak. Method: We conducted a rapid review of the factors associated with psychological distress (demographic characteristics, occupational, social, psychological, and infection-related factors) in HCW during an outbreak (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, H1N1, H7N9, Ebola). Four electronic databases (Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and the first 10 pages of Google Scholar) were searched (2000 to 10 July 2020) for relevant peer-reviewed research with a sample size >80. Results: From the 3335 records identified, 52 with data from 54,800 HCW were included. All but two studies were cross-sectional. Consistent evidence indicated that being female, a nurse, experiencing stigma, maladaptive coping, having contact or risk for contact with infected patients, and being quarantined, were risk factors for psychological distress among HCW. Personal and organisational social support, perceiving control, positive work attitudes, sufficient information about the outbreak and proper protection, training and resources, were associated with less psychological distress. Conclusions: This review highlighted the profiles of HCW who may be most at risk for psychological distress during an outbreak as well as several potential targets for interventions to reduce distress. More research is needed to track the associations of these factors with distress over time and the extent to which certain factors are inter-related and linked to sustained or transient distress.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fuschia M Sirois","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Janine Owens","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Weiping Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jianxi Gao","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Yung-Wai Desmond Chan","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akira Endo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20161422","rel_title":"Adherence to protective measures among health care workers in the UK; a cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20161422","rel_abs":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are frontline responders to emergency infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19. We investigated factors associated with adherence to personal protective behaviours in UK HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic using an online cross-sectional survey of 1035 healthcare professionals in the UK. Data were collected between 12th and 16th June 2020. Adjusted logistic regressions were used to separately investigate factors associated with adherence to use of personal protective equipment, maintaining good hand hygiene, and physical distancing from colleagues. Adherence to personal protective measures was suboptimal (PPE use: 80.0%, 95% CI [77.3 to 82.8], hand hygiene: 67.8%, 95% CI [64.6 to 71.0], coming into close contact with colleagues: 74.7%, 95% CI [71.7 to 77.7]). Adherence to PPE use was associated with having adequate PPE resources, receiving training during the pandemic, lower perceived fatalism from COVID-19, higher perceived social norms and higher perceived effectiveness of PPE. Adherence to physical distancing was associated with one's workplace being designed, using markings to facilitate physical distancing and receiving training during the pandemic. There were few associations with adherence to hand hygiene. Findings indicate HCWs should receive training on personal protective behaviours to decrease fatalism over contracting COVID-19 and increase perceived effectiveness of protective measures.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise E.

While blanket measures are slowly being lifted and infection numbers are monitored, a systematic strategy for balancing contact restrictions and the freedom necessary for a functioning society long-term in the absence of a vaccine is currently lacking. Here, we propose a regional strategy with locally triggered containment measures that can largely circumvent this trade-off and substantially lower the magnitude of restrictions the average individual will have to endure in the near future. For the simulation of future disease dynamics and its control, we use current data on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, England, New York State and Florida, taking into account the regional structure of each country and their past lockdown efficiency. Overall, our analysis shows that tight regional control in the short term can lead to long-term net benefits due to small-number effects which are amplified by the regional subdivision and crucially depend on the rate of cross-regional contacts. We outline the mechanisms and parameters responsible for these benefits and suggest possible was to gain access to them, simultaneously achieving more freedom for the population and successfully containing the epidemic. Our open-source simulation code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries. We hope that our analysis will help create sustainable, theory-driven long-term strategies for the management of the COVID-19 epidemic until therapy or immunization options are available.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip Bittihn","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Lukas Hupe","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Jonas Isensee","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Ramin Golestanian","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akira Endo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20161554","rel_title":"Concerns, quality of life, access to care and productivity of the general population during the first 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in Belgium and the Netherlands","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20161554","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has a disruptive impact on our society.

Methods: An online survey was conducted in a representative sample after 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in Belgium and the Netherlands. The survey included questions about stress, concerns, quality of life delayed\/cancelled medical care and productivity loss using validated questionnaires. Results: In total, 2099 Belgian and 2058 Dutch respondents completed the survey with a mean age of 46.4 and 42.0 years, respectively. Half of the respondents were female in both countries. A small proportion tested positive for COVID-19, 1.4% vs 4.7%, respectively. The majority of respondents with a medical condition was worried about their current health state due to the pandemic (53%) vs (63%), respectively. Respondents experienced postponed\/cancelled care (26%) and were concerned about the availability of medication (32%) for both countries. Productivity losses due to the COVID-19 restrictions were calculated in absenteeism (36%) and presenteeism (30%) for Belgium, and (19%) and (35%) for the Netherlands. Most concerns and productivity losses were reported by respondents with children <12 years, respondents aged 18-35 and respondents with an (expected) COVID-19 infection.

However, unlike influenza and other viruses, the burden of the disease in patients with asthma has been less evident. Objective: This study aims at a better understanding of the burden of COVID-19 in patients with asthma and the impact of asthma, its related comorbidities, and treatment on the prognosis of COVID-19. Methods: We analyzed clinical data from patients with asthma from January 1st to May 10th, 2020 using big data analytics and artificial intelligence through the SAVANA Manager clinical platform. Results: Out of 71,192 patients with asthma, 1,006 (1.41%) suffered from COVID-19. Compared to asthmatic individuals without COVID-19, patients with asthma and COVID-19 were significantly older (55 vs. 42 years), predominantly female (66% vs. 59%), had higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemias, diabetes, and obesity, and smoked more frequently. Contrarily, allergy-related factors such as rhinitis and eczema were less frequent in asthmatic patients with COVID-19 (P < .001). Higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity was also confirmed in those patients with asthma and COVID-19 who required hospital admission. The percentage of individuals using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was lower in patients who required hospitalization due to COVID-19, as compared to non-hospitalized patients (48.3% vs. 61.5%; OR: 0.58: 95% CI 0.44-0.77). During the study period, 865 (1.21%) patients with asthma were being treated with biologics. Although these patients showed increased severity and more comorbidities at the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) level, their hospital admission rates due to COVID-19 were relatively low (0.23%). COVID-19 increased inpatient mortality in asthmatic patients (2.29% vs 0.54%; OR 2.29: 95% CI 4.35-6.66). Conclusion: Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases in patients with asthma has been low, although higher than the observed in the general population. Patients with asthma and COVID-19 were older and were at increased risk due to comorbidity-related factors. ICS and biologics are generally safe and may be associated with a protective effect against severe COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Luis Izquierdo","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine.

This epidemiological and cohort study sought to investigate any causative association between COVID-19 infection and GBS. Methods The epidemiology of GBS cases reported via the UK National Immunoglobulin Database were studied from 2016-2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the cohort study, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society reported all cases of GBS during the pandemic. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19 (definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases were compared. Results The UK GBS incidence from 2016-2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100,000 people per year. GBS and COVID-19 incidence varied between regions and did not correlate (r = 0.06, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.63, p=0.86). GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of 2016-2019. Forty-seven GBS cases were included in the cohort study (13 definite, 12 probable COVID-19 and 22 non-COVID-19). There were no significant differences in the pattern of weakness, time to nadir, neurophysiology, CSF findings or outcome. Intubation was more frequent in the COVID-19+ve cohort (7\/13, 54% vs 5\/22, 23% in COVID negative) thought to be related directly to COVID-19 pulmonary involvement. Conclusions This study finds no epidemiological or phenotypic clues of SARS-CoV-2 being causative of GBS. GBS incidence has fallen during the pandemic which may be the influence of lockdown measures reducing transmission of GBS inducing pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni and respiratory viruses.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Keddie","author_inst":"1.

more than 1,000 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals have thus far been collected in the GEN-COVID Biobank (GCB). Sample types include whole blood, plasma, serum, leukocytes, and DNA. The GCB links samples to detailed clinical data available in the GEN-COVID Patient Registry (GCPR). It includes hospitalized patients (74.25%), broken down into intubated, treated by CPAP-biPAP, treated with O2 supplementation, and without respiratory support (9.5%, 18.4%, 31.55% and 14.8, respectively); and non-hospitalized subjects (25.75%), either pauci- or asymptomatic. More than 150 clinical patient-level data fields have been collected and binarized according to the organs\/systems primarily affected by COVID-19: heart, liver, pancreas, kidney, chemosensors, innate or adaptive immunity, and clotting system, for further statistics. Hierarchical Clustering analysis identified five main clinical categories: i) severe multisystemic failure with either thromboembolic or pancreatic variant; ii) cytokine storm type either severe with liver involvement or moderate; iii) moderate heart type either with or without liver damage; iv) moderate multisystemic involvement either with or without liver damage; v) mild either with or without hyposmia. GCB and GCPR are further linked to the GEN-COVID Genetic Data Repository (GCGDR), which includes data from Whole Exome Sequencing and high-density SNP genotyping. The data are available for sharing through the Network for Italian Genomes, within the COVID-19 dedicated section. The study objective is to systematize this comprehensive data collection and start identifying multi-organ involvement in COVID-19, defining genetic parameters for infection susceptibility within the population, and mapping genetically COVID-19 severity and clinical complexity among patients.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergio Daga","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Fallerini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Margherita Baldassarri","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Fava","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Floriana Valentino","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Doddato","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Benetti","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Annarita Giliberti","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rossella Tita","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Amitrano","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mirella Bruttini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Meloni","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Pinto","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Raimondi","author_inst":"Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Stella","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Filippo Biscarini","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Picchiotti","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM- SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Department of Mathematics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Gori","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM - SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Universite Cote d Azur, Inria, CNRS, I3S, Maasai"},{"author_name":"Pietro Pinoli","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ceri","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanarico","author_inst":"Independent Data Scientist, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francis P.

I find several important results. First, holding mobility fixed, temperature is found to have a negative and significant effect on COVID-19 cases from 1 to 8 weeks ahead and on deaths from 2 to 8 weeks ahead. Second, holding weather fixed, mobility is found to have a large positive effect on subsequent growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths. The impact on cases becomes significant 3 to 4 weeks ahead and continues through 8 to 10 weeks ahead. The impact on deaths becomes significant around 4 weeks ahead and persists for at least 10 weeks. Third, I find that the deleterious effects of mobility on COVID-19 outcomes are far greater when the local virus transmission rate is above one -- evidence supportive of public health policies aiming to reduce mobility specifically in places experiencing high transmission rates while relaxing restrictions elsewhere. Fourth, I find that the dynamic effects of mobility on cases are generally similar across counties, but the effects on deaths are higher for counties with older populations and, surprisingly, counties with lower black or hispanic population shares. Lastly, I find that while the marginal impact of mobility changes has been stable over recent weeks for cases, it has come down for deaths.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel John Wilson","author_inst":"Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chiara Fallerini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Margherita Baldassarri","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Fava","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Floriana Valentino","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Doddato","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Benetti","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Annarita Giliberti","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rossella Tita","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Amitrano","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mirella Bruttini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Meloni","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Pinto","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Raimondi","author_inst":"Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Stella","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Filippo Biscarini","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Picchiotti","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM- SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Department of Mathematics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Gori","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM - SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Universite Cote d Azur, Inria, CNRS, I3S, Maasai"},{"author_name":"Pietro Pinoli","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ceri","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanarico","author_inst":"Independent Data Scientist, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francis P.

Integration has also been highlighted as a critical element for building resilient health systems that can stand the shock of health emergencies. However, there is dearth of research and systematic synthesis of evidence on the synergistic relationship between integrated health services and pandemic preparedness in low- and low-middle income countries (LMICs). Thus, the authors are organizing a scoping review aiming to explore application of integrated health service delivery approaches during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. Methods and analysis This scoping review adheres to the six steps for scoping reviews from Arksey and OMalley (2005). Peer reviewed scientific literature will be systematically assembled utilizing a standardized and replicable search strategy from seven electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, the World Health Organization Global Research Database on COVID-19, and LitCovid. Initially, the title and abstract of the collected literature, published in English from December 2019 to June 2020, will be screened for inclusion which will be followed by a full text review by two independent reviewers. Data will be charted using a data extraction form and reported in narrative format with accompanying data matrices. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is required for the review. The study will be conducted from June to December 2020. Results from this study will provide a snapshot of the evidence currently being generated related to integrated health service delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will be developed into reports and a peer-reviewed articles and will assist policy makers in making pragmatic and evidence-based decisions for current and future pandemic response.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel Neill","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Md Zabir Hasan","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Das","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vasuki Venugopal","author_inst":"Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Nishant Jain","author_inst":"Indo-German Social Security Program, GIZ India, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Dinesh Arora","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shivam Gupta","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Annarita Giliberti","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rossella Tita","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Amitrano","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mirella Bruttini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Meloni","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Pinto","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Raimondi","author_inst":"Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Stella","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Filippo Biscarini","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Picchiotti","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM- SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Department of Mathematics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Gori","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM - SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Universite Cote d Azur, Inria, CNRS, I3S, Maasai"},{"author_name":"Pietro Pinoli","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ceri","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanarico","author_inst":"Independent Data Scientist, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francis P.

We establish Bellman systems which provide sufficiency conditions for mean-field-type equilibria in state-and-mean-field-type feedback form. We then derive unnormalized master adjoint systems (MASS). The methodology is shown to be flexible enough to capture multi-class interaction in epidemic propagation in which multiple authorities are risk-aware atomic decision-makers and individuals are risk-aware non-atomic decision-makers. Based on MASS, we present a data-driven modelling and analytics for mitigating Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The model integrates untested cases, age-structure, decision-making, gender, pre-existing health conditions, location, testing capacity, hospital capacity, mobility map on local areas, in-city, inter-cities, and international. It shown that the data-driven model can capture most of the reported data on COVID-19 on confirmed cases, deaths, recovered, number of testing and number of active cases in 66+ countries. The model also reports non-Gaussianity and non-exponential properties in 15+ countries.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hamidou Tembine","author_inst":"L&G Lab, NYUAD"},{"author_name":"Md Zabir Hasan","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Das","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vasuki Venugopal","author_inst":"Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Nishant Jain","author_inst":"Indo-German Social Security Program, GIZ India, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Dinesh Arora","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shivam Gupta","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Annarita Giliberti","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rossella Tita","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Amitrano","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mirella Bruttini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Meloni","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Pinto","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Raimondi","author_inst":"Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Stella","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Filippo Biscarini","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Picchiotti","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM- SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Department of Mathematics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Gori","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM - SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Universite Cote d Azur, Inria, CNRS, I3S, Maasai"},{"author_name":"Pietro Pinoli","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ceri","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanarico","author_inst":"Independent Data Scientist, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francis P.

Robust estimates of key time-to-event distributions remain scarce as well. Methods We collected individual records for 1,178 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and their 15,648 contacts identified by contact tracing and monitoring over the period from January 13 to April 02, 2020 in Hunan Province, China. We provide descriptive statistics of the characteristics of cases and their close contacts; we fitted distributions to time-to-key-events distributions and infectiousness profile over time; and we used generalized linear mixed model to estimate risk factors for susceptibility and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Results We estimated the mean serial interval at 5.5 days (95%CI -5.0, 19.9) and the mean generation time at 5.5 days (95%CI 1.7, 11.6). The infectiousness was estimated to peak 1.8 days before symptom onset, with 95% of transmission events occurring between 7.6 days before and 7.3 days after the date of symptom onset. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was estimated to be 62.5%. We estimated that at least 3.5% of cases were generated asymptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility was not significantly different between working-age adults (15-59 years old) and other age groups (0-14 years old: p-value=0.16; 60 years and over: p-value=0.33), whilst susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated to increase with age (p-value=0.03). In addition, transmission risk was higher for household contacts (p-value<0.001), decreased for higher generations within a cluster (second generation: odds ratio=0.13, p-value<0.001; generations 3-4: odds ratio=0.05, p-value<0.001, relative to generation 1), and decreased for infectors with a larger number of contacts (p-value=0.04). Interpretation Our findings warn of the possible relevant contribution of children to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. When lockdown interventions are in place, we found that odds of transmission are highest in the household setting but, with the relaxation of interventions, other settings (including schools) could bear a higher risk of transmission. Moreover, the estimated relevant fraction of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission highlight the importance of large-scale testing, contact tracing activities, and the use of personnel protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic.
