Currently it is unknown whether a positive serology results correlates with protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. There are also concerns regarding the low positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, especially when testing populations with low disease prevalence. Methods. A neutralization assay was validated in a set of PCR confirmed positive specimens and in a negative cohort. 9,530 specimens were screened using the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology assay and all positive results (N=164) were reanalyzed using the neutralization assay, the Roche total immunoglobin assay, and the Abbott IgG assay. The relationship between the magnitude of a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology result and the levels of neutralizing antibodies detected was correlated. Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were also longitudinally monitored in SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed patients. Results. The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay had a PPA of 96.6% with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and a NPA of 98.0% across 100 negative controls. ID50 neutralization titers positively correlated with all three clinical serology platforms. Longitudinal monitoring of hospitalized PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrates they made high neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2. PPA between the Diazyme IgG assay alone and the neutralization assay was 50.6%, while combining the Diazyme IgG assay with either the Roche or Abbott platforms increased the PPA to 79.2% and 78.4%, respectively. Conclusions. For the first time, we demonstrate that three widely available clinical serology assays positively correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity observed in COVID-19 patients. When a two-platform screen and confirm approach was used for SARS-CoV-2 serology, nearly 80% of two-platform positive specimens had neutralization titers (ID50 >50).","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raymond T Suhandynata","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Melissa A Hoffman","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Deli Huang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jenny T Tran","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael J Kelner","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Sharon L Reed","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ronald W McLawhon","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"James E Voss","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Nemazee","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Robert Fitzgerald","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.11.20151365","rel_title":"Decreased serum levels of inflammaging marker miR-146a are associated with clinical response to tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.11.20151365","rel_abs":"Background. Current COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to global health and healthcare systems. At least in western countries, the most amount of the death toll is accounted by old people affected by age-related diseases. In this regard, we proposed that COVID-19 severity may be tightly related to inflammaging, i.e. the age-related onset of inflammation, which is responsible for age-related diseases. It has been reported that systemic hyper-inflammation may turn to be detrimental in COVID-19 patients. Objective. Here, we exploited a recently closed clinical trial (NCT04315480) on the anti-IL-6 drug tocilizumab to assess whether microRNAs regulating inflammaging can be assessed as biomarkers of drug response and outcome. Methods. Serum levels of miR-146a-5p, -21-5p, and -126-3p were quantified by RT-PCR and Droplet Digital PCR by two independent laboratories on 30 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19, characterized by multifocal interstitial pneumonia confirmed by CT-scan and requiring oxygen therapy, and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. COVID-19 patients were treated with a single-dose intravenous infusion of 8 mg\/kg tocilizumab and categorized into responders and non-responders. Results. We showed that COVID-19 patients who did not respond to tocilizumab have lower serum levels of miR-146a-5p after the treatment (p=0.007). Moreover, among non-responders, those with the lowest serum levels of miR-146a-5p experienced the most adverse outcome (p=0.008). Conclusion. Our data show that blood-based biomarkers, such as miR-146a-5p, can provide a molecular link between inflammaging and COVID-19 clinical course, thus allowing to enlarge the drug armory against this worldwide health threat.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacopo Sabbatinelli","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Angelica Giuliani","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Giulia Matacchione","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Silvia Latini","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Noemi Laprovitera","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Pomponio","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Alessia Ferrarini","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Silvia Svegliati Baroni","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Marianna Pavani","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Marco Moretti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Armando Gabrielli","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Antonio Domenico Procopio","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Manuela Ferracin","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Bonaf\u00e8","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Olivieri","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150904","rel_title":"Serological Tests for SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus by Commercially Available Point-of-Care and Laboratory Diagnostics in Pre-COVID-19 Samples in Japan","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150904","rel_abs":"Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in pre-COVID-19 samples in Japan showed 1.5%-1.75% positives, and previous surveys might overestimate COVID-19 seroprevalence in several population of Japan.

The containment strategy for COVID-19, which has non-specific flu-like symptoms and where upwards of 80% of the affected has either mild or no symptoms, is critically centered upon diagnostic testing, tracking and isolation. Thus, the development of specific and sensitive diagnostic tests for COVID-19 is key towards the first successful step of disease management. Public health organizations like the WHO and the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed real-time PCR (RT-PCR) based diagnostic tests to aid in the detection of acute infection. In this study we sought to modify the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay protocol to increase its sensitivity and to make the assay directly portable to health care providers in a community-based hospital setting. A number of modifications to the original protocol were tested. Increasing the RT-PCR annealing temperature by 7{degrees}C to 62{degrees}C was associated with the most significant improvement in sensitivity, wherein the cycle-threshold (Ct) value for the N2 assay was reduced by ~3 units, in effect both reducing the overall number of inconclusive results and yielding N1\/N2 assays to have similar Ct values. The limit of detection of the modified assay was also improved (0.86 RNA copies\/l for both nCoV 2019_N1\/N2 assays) compared to the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay (1 and 3.16 RNA copies\/l for nCoV 2019_N1 and N2 assay, respectively). Using this modification, there was no significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 detection rate when viral RNA extraction was performed either manually or through an automated extraction method. We believe this modified protocol allows for more sensitive detection of the virus which in turn will be useful for pandemic management.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Srirupa Das","author_inst":"Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Candice Dowell-Martino","author_inst":"Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Lisa Arrigo","author_inst":"Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Paul N.

Border screening typically consists of arriving individuals being thermally scanned for signs of fever and\/or completing a survey to declare any possible symptoms, and while more thorough testing typically exists, these would generally prove more disruptive to deploy. In this paper, we utilise epidemiological data and Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the potential success rate of deploying border screening for a range of diseases (including the current COVID-19 pandemic) in varying outbreak scenarios. We negate the issue of testing precision by assuming a perfect test is used; our outputs then represent the best-case scenario. We then use these outputs to briefly explore the types of scenarios where the implementation of border screening could prove most effective. Our models only considers screening implemented at airports, due to air travel being the predominant method of international travel. Primary results showed that in the best-case scenario, screening has the potential to detect 46.4%, 12.9% and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and ebola respectively, while screening for COVID-19 could potentially detect 12.0% of infected travellers. We compare our results to those already in the published literature.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Declan Bays","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Thomas Finnie","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Paul N.

Assessing case density and spread of infection is critical and relies largely on clinical testing data. However, clinical testing suffers from known limitations, including test availability and a bias towards enumerating only symptomatic individuals. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has gained widespread support as a potential complement to clinical testing for assessing COVID-19 infections at the community scale. The efficacy of WBE hinges on the ability to accurately characterize SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. To date, a variety of sampling schemes have been used without consensus around the appropriateness of grab or composite sampling. Here we address a key WBE knowledge gap by examining the variability of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater grab samples collected every 2 hours for 72 hours compared with corresponding 24-hour flow-weighted composite samples. Results show relatively low variability (mean for all assays = 741 copies 100 mL-1, standard deviation = 508 copies 100 mL-1) for grab sample concentrations, and good agreement between most grab samples and their respective composite (mean deviation from composite = 159 copies 100 mL-1). When SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are used to calculate viral load, the discrepancy between grabs (log10 difference = 12.0) or a grab and its associated composite (log10 difference = 11.8) are amplified. A similar effect is seen when estimating carrier prevalence in a catchment population with median estimates based on grabs ranging 62-1853 carriers. Findings suggest that grab samples may be sufficient to characterize SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, but additional calculations using these data may be sensitive to grab sample variability and warrant the use of flow-weighted composite sampling. These data inform future WBE work by helping determine the most appropriate sampling scheme and facilitate sharing of datasets between studies via consistent methodology.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyle Curtis","author_inst":"Hampton Roads Sanitation District"},{"author_name":"David Keeling","author_inst":"Hampton Roads Sanitation District"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Yetka","author_inst":"Hampton Roads Sanitation District"},{"author_name":"Allison Larson","author_inst":"Hampton Roads Sanitation District"},{"author_name":"Raul Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hampton Roads Sanitation District"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Pomponio","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Alessia Ferrarini","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Silvia Svegliati Baroni","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Marianna Pavani","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Marco Moretti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Armando Gabrielli","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Antonio Domenico Procopio","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Manuela Ferracin","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Bonaf\u00e8","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Olivieri","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150656","rel_title":"Diagnostic value of skin manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150656","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 causes multiple immune-related reactions at various stages of the disease. The wide variety of skin presentations has delayed linking these to the virus. Previous studies had attempted to look at the prevalence and timing of SARS-COV-2 rashes but were based on mostly hospitalized severe cases and had little follow up. Using data collected on a subset of 336,847 eligible UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app, we observed that 8.8% of the swab positive cases (total: 2,021 subjects) reported either a body rash or an acral rash, compared to 5.4% of those with a negative swab test (total: 25,136). Together, these two skin presentations showed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41-1.96) for being swab positive. Skin rashes were also predictive in the larger untested group of symptomatic app users (N=54,652), as 8.2% of those who had reported at least one classical COVID-19 symptom, i.e., fever, persistent cough, and\/or anosmia, also reported a rash. Data from an independent online survey of 11,546 respondents with a rash showed that in 17% of swab positive cases, the rash was the initial presentation. Furthermore, in 21%, the rash was the only clinical sign. Skin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other classical symptoms. Recognising rashes is important in identifying new and earlier COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veronique Bataille","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Niccolo' Rossi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abigail Bournot","author_inst":"Zoe Global Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Armando Gabrielli","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Antonio Domenico Procopio","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Manuela Ferracin","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Bonaf\u00e8","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Olivieri","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20147942","rel_title":"The emergence of COVID-19 in Indonesia: analysis of predictors of infection and mortality using independent and clustered data approaches","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20147942","rel_abs":"Background: Analyses of correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mortality have usually assessed individual predictors. This study aimed to determine if patterns of combined predictors may better identify risk of infection and mortality. Methods: For the period of March 2nd to 10th 2020, the first 9 days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia, we selected all 18 confirmed cases, of which 6 died, and all 60 suspected cases, of which 1 died; and 28 putatively negative patients with pneumonia and no travel history. We recorded data for travel, contact history, symptoms, haematology, comorbidities, and chest x-ray. Hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) and principal component analyses (PCA) identified cluster and covariance patterns for symptoms or haematology which were analysed with other predictors of infection or mortality using logistic regression. Results: For univariate analyses, no significant association with infection was seen for fever, cough, dyspnoea, headache, runny nose, sore throat, gastrointestinal complaints (GIC), or haematology. A PCA symptom component for fever, cough, and GIC tended to increase risk of infection (OR 3.41; 95% CI 1.06 - 14; p=0.06), and a haematology component with elevated monocytes decreased risk (OR 0.26; 0.07 - 0.79; 0.027). Multivariate analysis revealed that an HCA cluster of 3-5 symptoms, typically fever, cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat but little dyspnoea and no GIC tended to reduce risk (aOR 0.048; <0.001 - 0.52; 0.056). In univariate analyses for death, an HCA cluster of cough, fever and dyspnoea had increased risk (OR 5.75; 1.06 - 31.3, 0.043), but no other individual predictor, cluster or component was associated. Other significant predictors of infection were age >= 45, international travel, contact with COVID-19 patient, and pneumonia. Diabetes and history of contact were associated with higher mortality. Conclusions: Cluster groups and co-variance patterns may be stronger correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection than individual predictors. Comorbidities may warrant careful attention as would COVID-19 exposure levels.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erlina Burhan","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology and Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia; Persahabatan General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Ari Fahrial Syam","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Jabir Rahyussalim","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedic and Traumatology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Prasenohadi Prasenohadi","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology and Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia; Persahabatan General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Navy G Lolong Wulung","author_inst":"Persahabatan General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Agus Dwi Susanto","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology and Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia; Persahabatan General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"I Gede Ketut Sajinadiyasa","author_inst":"Sanglah General Hospital, Bali, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Dewi Puspitorini","author_inst":"Gatot Soebroto Central Army Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Dewi Lestari","author_inst":"Raden Mattaher District Hospital, Jambi, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Indah Suci Widyahening","author_inst":"Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Vivi Setiawaty","author_inst":"Center for Research and Development for Biomedical and Basic Health Technology, National Institute of Health Research and Development, Ministry of Health, Repub"},{"author_name":"Dwiana Ocviyanti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Kartika Qonita Putri","author_inst":"Medical Study Program, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Aswin Guntara","author_inst":"Medical Study Program, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Davrina Rianda","author_inst":"Human Nutrition Research Center, Indonesian Medical Education and Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Anuraj H Shankar","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research "},{"author_name":"Rina Agustina","author_inst":"Human Nutrition Research Center, Indonesian Medical Education and Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia; Department of Nutrition, Faculty "}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20149773","rel_title":"Clinical importance of reporting SARS-CoV-2 viral loads across the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20149773","rel_abs":"On April 25th, corresponding to the first deconfinement phase after the end of the lockdown in Switzerland, a universal admission screening strategy for COVID-19 was introduced in our hospital.

Here, we discuss the importance of reporting viral load values when a shift from a symptomatic to a universal screening strategy was performed.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Milo Moraz","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Damien Jacot","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Matthaios Papadimitriou-Olivgeris","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Service, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Laurence Senn","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Service, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Gilbert Greub","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Katia Jaton","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Onya Opota","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Dewi Puspitorini","author_inst":"Gatot Soebroto Central Army Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Dewi Lestari","author_inst":"Raden Mattaher District Hospital, Jambi, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Indah Suci Widyahening","author_inst":"Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Vivi Setiawaty","author_inst":"Center for Research and Development for Biomedical and Basic Health Technology, National Institute of Health Research and Development, Ministry of Health, Repub"},{"author_name":"Dwiana Ocviyanti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Kartika Qonita Putri","author_inst":"Medical Study Program, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Aswin Guntara","author_inst":"Medical Study Program, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Davrina Rianda","author_inst":"Human Nutrition Research Center, Indonesian Medical Education and Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Anuraj H Shankar","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research "},{"author_name":"Rina Agustina","author_inst":"Human Nutrition Research Center, Indonesian Medical Education and Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia; Department of Nutrition, Faculty "}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20149245","rel_title":"Dynamics of RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 Detection Rates Prior to and After Symptom Onset","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20149245","rel_abs":"Effective RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 is essential for treatment, surveillance and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Older age and cardiovascular disease are also associated with COVID-19 mortality. We compared the male-to-female (sex) ratios in mortality by age for COVID-19 with cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality in the general population. Methods: We obtained data from official government sources in the US and five European countries: Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. We analyzed COVID-19 deaths by sex and age in these countries and similarly analyzed their deaths from cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke) and cancer, the two leading age-related causes of death in middle-to-high income countries. Findings: In both the US and European countries, the sex ratio of deaths from COVID-19 exceeded one throughout adult life. The sex ratio increased up to a peak in midlife, and then declined markedly in later life. This pattern was also observed for the sex ratio of deaths from cardiovascular disease, but not cancer, in the general populations of the US and European countries. Interpretation: The sex ratios of deaths from COVID-19 and from cardiovascular disease exhibit similar patterns across the adult life course. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, but could stem partially from sex-related biological differences that underlie the similar pattern for cardiovascular disease. These include, we propose, comparatively longer telomeres in females, ovarian hormones, and X chromosome mosaicism.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ila Nimgaonkar","author_inst":"Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School"},{"author_name":"Linda Valeri","author_inst":"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Ezra S.

Methodology: Covid-19 data extracted from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Then, a novel method implemented in the incidence and Optimum function in desolve package to the data of cumulative daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating the reproduction number in the R software. Result: Analysis has been seen that the lockdown was really quite as effective, India has already shown a major steady decline. The growth rate has fluctuated about 20 percent with trend line projections in various lockdown. A comparative analysis gives an idea of decline in value of R0 from 1.73 to 1.08.

However, the effect of IGF-1 levels on COVID-19 prognosis remains unknown. Objective: To investigate the association between circulating IGF-1 concentrations and mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: 1425 COVID-19 patients who had pre-diagnostic serum IGF-1 measurements at baseline (2006-2010). Main outcome measures: COVID-19 mortality (available death data updated to 22 May 2020). Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality across the IGF-1 quartiles. Results: Among 1425 COVID-19 patients, 365 deaths occurred due to COVID-19. Compared to the lowest quartile of IGF-1 concentrations, the highest quartile was associated with a 37% lower risk of mortality (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43-0.93, P-trend=0.03). The association was stronger in women and nonsmokers (both P-interaction=0.01). Conclusions: Higher IGF-1 concentrations are associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 mortality. Further studies are required to determine whether and how targeting IGF-1 pathway might improve COVID-19 prognosis.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xikang Fan","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Yin","author_inst":"Jiangning Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Wang","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mingjia Yang","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hongxia Ma","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guangfu Jin","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mingyang Song","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

A crucial role in epidemics is played by the number of undetected infective individuals who continue to circulate and spread the disease. Epidemiological investigations and mathematical models have revealed that the rapid diffusion of Covid-19 can mostly be attributed to the large percentage of undocumented infective individuals who escape testing. Methods. The dynamics of an infection can be described by the SIR model, which divides the population into susceptible (S), infective (I) and removed (R) subjects. In particular, we exploited the Kermack and McKendrick epidemic model which can be applied when the population is much larger than the fraction of infected subjects. Results. We proved that the fraction of undocumented infectives, in comparison to the total number of infected subjects, is given by 1-1\/R0 , where R0 is the basic reproduction number. Its mean value R0=2.10 (2.09-2.11) in three Italian regions for the Covid-19 epidemic yielded a percentage of undetected infectives of 52.4% (52.2% - 52.6%) compared to the total number of infectives. Conclusions. Our results, straightforwardly obtained from the SIR model, highlight the role played by undetected carriers in the transmission and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such evidence strongly recommends careful monitoring of the infective population and ongoing adjustment of preventive measures for disease control until a vaccine becomes available.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maurizio Melis","author_inst":"AART (Association for the Advancement of Research on Transplantation), Cagliari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Littera","author_inst":"Complex Structure of Medical Genetics, R.

While recent reports showed increased distress and depressive\/anxiety state related to COVID-19 crisis, we investigated how home quarantine affected sleep parameters in healthy individuals. Methods 160 healthy individuals who were in home quarantine in April 2020 for at least one month participated in this study. Participants rated and compared their quantitative sleep parameters (time to go to bed, sleep duration, getting-up time) and sleep quality factors, pre-and during home quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, participants chronotype was determined to see if sleep parameters are differentially affected in different chronotypes. Results The time to fall asleep and get-up in the morning were significantly delayed in all participants, indicating a significant circadian misalignment. Sleep quality was reported to be significantly poorer in all participants and chronotypes, and included more daily disturbances (more sleep disturbances, higher daily dysfunctions due to low quality of sleep) and less perceived sleep quality (lower subjective sleep quality, longer time taken to fall asleep at night, more use of sleep medication for improving sleep quality) during home quarantine. Conclusions Home quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic has a detrimental impact on sleep quality. Online interventions including self-help sleep programs, stress management, relaxation practices, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, and mindfulness training are available interventions in the current situation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Salehinejad","author_inst":"Department of Psychology and Neurosciences, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors"},{"author_name":"Maryam Majidinezhad","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Elham Ghanavati","author_inst":"Ruhr-University Bochum, Department of Psychology, Bochum, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sahar Kouestanian","author_inst":"Institute for Cognitive Science Studies, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Carmelo M.

The need to include migrants (both regular and irregular or undocumented) in national strategic response plans for disease prevention and control has been increasingly recognized. Better understanding of the existing scientific evidence in migration health is crucial in designing effective response measures. In this paper, we present a protocol for a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications on COVID-19 and migration health. Expected study findings aim to provide valuable information to support evidence mapping on COVID-19 and migration health, particularly the identification of important research gaps. Methods and analysis: Using Elseviers Scopus abstract and citation database, a comprehensive search strategy will be applied to map scientific publications on COVID-19 and migration health. The current analysis will focus on research published from 1 January 2020 to 4 May 2020. The search query on migration health will largely focus on migration, migrant and human mobility-related terms. Three reviewers will screen publications for eligibility. The extracted bibliographic information will be analysed to determine the dominant research themes, country coverage and migrant groups.

In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, ReCoNet (residual image-based COVID-19 detection network), is proposed for COVID-19 detection. This is achieved from chest X-ray (CXR) images shedding light on the preprocessing task considered to be very useful for enhancing the COVID-19 fingerprints. The proposed modular architecture consists of a CNN-based multi-level preprocessing filter block in cascade with a multi-layer CNN-based feature extractor and a classification block. A multi-task learning loss function is adopted for optimization of the preprocessing block trained end-to-end with the rest of the proposed network. Additionally, a data augmentation technique is applied for boosting the network performance. The whole network when pre-trained end-to-end on the CheXpert open source dataset, and trained and tested with the COVIDx dataset of 15,134 original CXR images yielded an overall benchmark accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97.48%, 96.39%, and 97.53%, respectively. The immense potential of ReCoNet may be exploited in clinics for rapid and safe detection of COVID-19 globally, in particular in the low and middle income countries where RT-PCR labs and\/or kits are in a serious crisis.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sabbir Ahmed","author_inst":"Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology"},{"author_name":"Moi Hoon Yap","author_inst":"Manchester Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Maxine Tan","author_inst":"Monash University Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Md.

The lockdown policy has generated considerable controversy, with critics arguing that it was done without adequate notice or planning, exposed vulnerable section of the population to a humanitarian crisis, and failed to contain the spread of COVID. In response, the Government has claimed that lockdown slowed the transmission process of COVID, thereby reducing the number of cases and deaths substantially. The consequent pressure on the health infrastructure was also much less. To judge between competing claims, this study has undertaken the first cost-benefit analysis of the worlds biggest lockdown. Although the data for a proper cost-benefit analysis is currently not available, we have made a ball point estimate of the net benefit of the lockdown under alternative scenarios. Our estimates reveal the net benefits of lockdown to be negative; moreover, the results are robust under all scenarios.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mousumi Dutta","author_inst":"Presidency University, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Zakir Husain","author_inst":"Presidency University"},{"author_name":"Maxine Tan","author_inst":"Monash University Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Md.

This paper defines the term lockdown and describes the design, timing and implementation of lockdown in nine countries in Sub Saharan Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It also discusses the manner in which lockdown is enforced, the need to mitigate the harms of lockdown, and the association between lockdown and the reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. While there are some commonalities in the implementation of lockdown, a more notable finding is the variation in the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures across the nine countries. We found that the number of reported cases is heavily dependent on the number of tests done, and that testing rates ranged from 9 to 21,261 per million population. The reported number of COVID-19 deaths per million population also varies, but is generally low when compared to countries in Europe and North America. While lockdown measures may have helped inhibit some community transmission, the pattern and nature of the epidemic remains unclear. Of concern are signs of lockdown harming health by affecting the functioning of the health system and causing social and economic harms. This paper highlights the need for inter-sectoral and trans-disciplinary research capable of providing a rigorous and holistic assessment of the harms and benefits of lockdown.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Najmul Haider","author_inst":"The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL9 7TA, UK"},{"author_name":"Abdinasir Yusuf Osman","author_inst":"The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL9 7TA, UK"},{"author_name":"Audrey Gadzekpo","author_inst":"University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana"},{"author_name":"George O.

However, the literature on transmission routes and risk factors for COVID-19 in HCWs is limited. Aim To examine the characteristics and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in a university teaching hospital in London, UK. Methods Staff records and virology testing results were combined to identify staff sickness and COVID-19 rates from March to April 2020. Comparisons were made with staff professional groups, department of work and ethnicity. Analysis was performed using Microsoft ExcelTM. Findings COVID-19 rates in our HCWs largely rose and declined in parallel with the number of community cases. White and non-white ethnic groups among our HCWs had similar rates of infection. Clinical staff had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than non-clinical staff, but total sickness rates were similar. Doctors had the highest rate of infection, but took the fewest sickness days. Critical Care had lower rates than the Emergency Department (ED), but rates in the ED declined once all staff were advised to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Conclusion These findings show that sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among our hospital staff did not occur, beyond the community outbreak, even in the absence of strict infection control measures in non-clinical areas. The results also suggest that current PPE is effective when used appropriately. In addition, our findings emphasise the importance of testing both clinical and non-clinical staff groups during a pandemic.

However, the missing asymptomatic cases have been significantly overlooked because of imperfect sensitivity of nucleic acid testing. We aimed to investigate the humoral immunity in asymptomatics, which will help us develop serological tests and improve early identification, understand the humoral immunity to COVID-19, and provide more rational control strategies for the pandemic. Objective To better control the pandemic of COVID-19, dynamics of IgM and IgG responses to 23 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and neutralizing antibody in asymptomatic COVID-19 infections after exposure time were investigated. Design, setting, and participants 63 asymptomatic individuals were screened by RT-qPCR and ELISA for IgM and IgG from 11,776 personnel returning to work, and close contacts with the confirmed cases in different communities of Wuhan by investigation of clusters and tracing infectious sources. 63 healthy contacts with both negative results for NAT and antibodies were selected as negative controls. 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were also screened as controls from 1056 patients during hospitalization in Tongji Hospital. A total of 177 participants were enrolled in this study and serial serum samples (n=213) were collected. The research was conducted between 17 February 2020 and 28 April 2020. Serum IgM and IgG profiles of 177 participants were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray. Neutralizing antibody responses in different population were detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of IgM and IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset. Results Asymptomatics were classified into four subgroups based on NAT and serological tests. In particular, only 19% had positive NAT results while approximately 81% detected positive IgM\/IgG responses. Comparative SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray further demonstrated that there was a significantly difference of antibody dynamics responding to S1 or N proteins among three populations, although IgM and IgG profiles could not be used to differentiate them. S1 specific IgM responses were elicited in asymptomatic individuals as early to the seventh day after exposure and peaked on days from 17d to 25d, which might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker and give an additional 36.5% seropositivity. Mild patients produced stronger both S1 specific IgM and neutralizing antibody responses than asymptomatic individuals. Most importantly, S1 specific IgM\/IgG responses and the titers of neutralizing antibody in asymptomatic individuals gradually vanished in two months. Conclusions and relevance Our findings might have important implications for the definition of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, diagnosis, serological survey, public health and immunization strategies.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qing Lei","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hongyan Hou","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Feng Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yandi Zhang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Danyun Lai","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Banga Ndzouboukou Jo-Lewis","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhaowei Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Zhuqing Ouyang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbiao Xue","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaosong Lin","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yunxiao Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Zhongjie Yao","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuening Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Caizheng Yu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hainan Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Huan Qi","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shujuan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shenghai Huang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ziyong Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xionglin Fan","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20148429","rel_title":"Longitudinal evaluation and decline of antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20148429","rel_abs":"Antibody (Ab) responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10-15 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of this virus in the human population it is not yet known how long these Ab responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from re-infection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 days post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, we show seroconversion in >95% of cases and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses when sampled beyond 8 days POS. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the nAb response is dependent upon the disease severity, but this does not affect the kinetics of the nAb response. Declining nAb titres were observed during the follow up period. Whilst some individuals with high peak ID50 (>10,000) maintained titres >1,000 at >60 days POS, some with lower peak ID50 had titres approaching baseline within the follow up period. A similar decline in nAb titres was also observed in a cohort of seropositive healthcare workers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. We suggest that this transient nAb response is a feature shared by both a SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes low disease severity and the circulating seasonal coronaviruses that are associated with common colds.

The age-related susceptibility is partly explained by increased comorbidities including dementia and type II diabetes. While it is unclear why these diseases predispose risk, we hypothesize that increased biological age, rather than chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity with age. To test this hypothesis, we applied our previously validated biological age measure (PhenoAge) composed of chronological age and nine clinical chemistry biomarkers to data of 347,751 participants from a large community cohort in the United Kingdom (UK Biobank), recruited between 2006 and 2010. Other data included disease diagnoses (to 2017), mortality data (to 2020), and the UK national COVID-19 test results (to May 31, 2020). Accelerated aging 10-14 years prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with test positivity (OR=1.15 per 5-year acceleration, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.21, p=3.2x10-6) and all-cause mortality with test-confirmed COVID-19 (OR=1.25, per 5-year acceleration, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.44, p=0.002) after adjustment for demographics including current chronological age and pre-existing diseases or conditions. The corresponding areas under the curves were 0.669 and 0.803, respectively. Biological aging, as captured by PhenoAge, is a better predictor of COVID-19 severity than chronological age, and may inform risk stratification initiatives, while also elucidating possible underlying mechanisms, particularly those related to inflammaging.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chia-Ling Kuo","author_inst":"University of Connecticu Health"},{"author_name":"Luke C Pilling","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Janice C Atkins","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Jane Masoli","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Joao Delgado","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Christopher Tignanelli","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"George Kuchel","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"David Melzer","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Kenneth B Beckman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Gilberto Betancor","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Harry D Wilson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Adrian W Signell","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Helena Winstone","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Kerridge","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Luke Snell","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Amelia Moore","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Adrian Green","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Lauren Martinez","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Brielle Stokes","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Johanna Honey","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Alba Izquierdo-Barras","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Gill Arbane","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Amita Patel","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Lorcan OConnell","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Sam Douthwaite","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Gaia Nebbia","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Rocio Martinez-Nunez","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D.

Although the disease, named COVID-19, has a lower prevalence in infancy and has been described as mild, the clinical characteristics may vary and there is a possibility of complications. Objectives: To describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pediatric cases confirmed in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, during the first three months of the pandemic, and of children admitted with COVID-19 to a secondary hospital. Methods: This case series includes all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR testing, identified in the state epidemiological surveillance system between March 1 and May 31, 2020. Confirmed patients admitted to the Sinaloa Pediatric Hospital (HPS) during the same dates are also described. Results: Fifty one children with SARS-CoV-2 were included, 10 of the admitted to HPS. The median age was 10 years. The more frequent symptoms were fever (78%), cough (67%) and headache (57%). Most cases were mild or asymptomatic. Three patients with comorbidities died. Only 4 of 10 patients identified in HPS had been admitted with the diagnosis of possible COVID-19. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection in children was mostly mild or asymptomatic, but with a wide range of clinical presentations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giordano Perez Gaxiola","author_inst":"Sinaloa Pediatric Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rosalino Flores Rocha","author_inst":"Sinaloa Pediatric Hospital"},{"author_name":"Julio Cesar Valadez Vidarte","author_inst":"Sinaloa Pediatric Hospital"},{"author_name":"Melissa Hernandez Alcaraz","author_inst":"Sinaloa Pediatric Hospital - UAD"},{"author_name":"Gilberto Herrera Mendoza","author_inst":"Sinaloa Pediatric Hospital - UAS"},{"author_name":"Miguel Alejandro Del Real Lugo","author_inst":"Epidemiological Intelligence Unit.

COVID-19 infection exhibits signs that are shared with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, which may lead to needless interventions and iatrogenic preterm delivery. Objective: We evaluated the prevalence of HELLP-like signs in pregnant women admitted for COVID-19 and the value of angiogenic factors to rule out preeclampsia. Methods: a consecutive series of 27 pregnant women beyond 20 weeks of gestation, with symptomatic COVID-19. Clinical and analytical features were recorded and those cases with signs of HELLP syndrome were tested for sFlt-1\/PlGF ratio. Results: Seven patients (25.9%) presented at least one sign of suspected HELLP syndrome, of which 2 (7.4%) were diagnosed clinically with PE because of hypertension and high transaminases and 5 (18.5%) had only elevated transaminases. sFlt-1\/PlGF ratio was normal in 6 of 7. Conclusion: Symptomatic COVID-19 may simulate severe preeclampsia in pregnancy. Angiogenic factors may be essential to avoid false diagnosis and needless interventions.

The standard diagnostic pipeline for testing SARS-CoV-2 presence in patients with an ongoing infection is predominantly based on pharyngeal swabs, from which the viral RNA is extracted using commercial kits followed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR detection. As a result of the large demand for testing, commercial RNA extraction kits may be limited and alternative, non-commercial protocols are needed. Here, we provide a magnetic bead RNA extraction protocol that is predominantly based on in-house made reagents and is performed in 96-well plates supporting large-scale testing. Magnetic bead RNA extraction was benchmarked against the commercial QIAcube extraction platform. Comparable viral RNA detection sensitivity and specificity were obtained by fluorescent and colorimetric RT-LAMP using N primers, as well as RT-qPCR using E gene primers showing that the here presented RNA extraction protocol can be combined with a variety of detection methods at high throughput. Importantly, the presented diagnostic workflow can be quickly set up in a laboratory without access to an automated pipetting robot.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steffen Klein","author_inst":"Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thorsten G.
