So far, there is none vaccines or specific antiviral drugs approved for that. Therapeutic antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, was obtained from hyper immune equine plasma in this study. Herein, SARS-CoV-2 RBD with gram level were obtained through Chinese hamster ovary cells high-density fermentation. The binding of RBD to SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human ACE2, was verified and the efficacy of RBD in vivo was tested on mice and then on horses. As a result, RBD triggered high-titer neutralizing antibodies in vivo, and immunoglobulin fragment F(ab)2 was prepared from horse antisera through removing Fc. Neutralization test demonstrated that RBD-specific F(ab)2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 at 0.07 g\/ml, showing a potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2. These results highlights as RBD-specific F(ab)2 as therapeutic candidate for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Pan","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan YZY Biopharma Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tiejiong Fan","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Yan Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan YZY Biopharma Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Shi","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Weijuan Shang","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Fang","author_inst":"Wuhan YZY Biopharma Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiaming Jiang","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jian Shi","author_inst":"Wuhan YZY Biopharma Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yuan Sun","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Zhao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Ze Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"pharmacology and toxicology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.030734","rel_title":"Reversal of Infected Host Gene Expression Identifies Repurposed Drug Candidates for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.030734","rel_abs":"The repurposing of existing drugs offers the potential to expedite therapeutic discovery against the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We have developed an integrative approach to predict repurposed drug candidates that can reverse SARS-CoV-2-induced gene expression in host cells, and evaluate their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. We found that 13 virus-induced gene expression signatures computed from various viral preclinical models could be reversed by compounds previously identified to be effective against SARS- or MERS-CoV, as well as drug candidates recently reported to be efficacious against SARS-CoV-2. Based on the ability of candidate drugs to reverse these 13 infection signatures, as well as other clinical criteria, we identified 10 novel candidates. The four drugs bortezomib, dactolisib, alvocidib, and methotrexate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells at < 1 {micro}M, but only methotrexate did not exhibit unfavorable cytotoxicity. Although further improvement of cytotoxicity prediction and bench testing is required, our computational approach has the potential to rapidly and rationally identify repurposed drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The analysis of signature genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 also revealed interesting time-dependent host response dynamics and critical pathways for therapeutic interventions (e.g. Rho GTPase activation and cytokine signaling suppression).","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Xing","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Rama Shankar","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Drelich","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Shreya Paithankar","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Eugene Chekalin","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dexheimer","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Sze Chua","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Surender Rajasekaran","author_inst":"Helen Devos Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te Kent Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Sun","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Zhao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Ze Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.030684","rel_title":"The aging transcriptome and cellular landscape of the human lung in relation to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.030684","rel_abs":"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4+ Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age-associated genes have functional effects on SARS-CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, age-associated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan D Chow","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Sidi Chen","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Drelich","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Shreya Paithankar","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Eugene Chekalin","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dexheimer","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Sze Chua","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Surender Rajasekaran","author_inst":"Helen Devos Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te Kent Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Sun","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Zhao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Ze Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.027854","rel_title":"Decoding the lethal effect of SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus) strains from global perspective: molecular pathogenesis and evolutionary divergence","rel_date":"2020-04-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.027854","rel_abs":"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a disease with global public health emergency that have shook the world since its first detection in China in December, 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible behind this pandemic. The lethality of different viral strains is found to vary in different geographical locations but the molecular mechanism is yet to be known.\n\nMethodsAvailable data of whole genome sequencing of different viral strains published by different countries were retrieved and then analysed using Multiple Sequence Alignment and Pair-wise Sequence Alignment leading to Phylogenetic tree construction. Each location and the corresponding genetic variations were screened in depth. Then the variations are analysed at protein level giving special emphasis on Non Synonymous amino acid substitutions. The fatality rates in different countries were matched against the mutation number, rarity of the nucleotide alterations and functional impact of the Non Synonymous changes at protein level, separately and in combination.\n\nFindingsAll the viral strains have been found to evolve from the viral strain of Taiwan (MT192759) which is 100% identical with the ancestor SARS-CoV-2 sequences of Wuhan (NC 045512.2; submitted on 5th Jan, 2020). Transition from C to T (C>T) is the most frequent mutation in this viral genome and mutations A>T, G>A, T>A are the rarest ones, found in countries with maximum fatality rate i.e Italy, Spain and Sweden. 20 Non Synonymous mutations are located in viral genome spanning Orf1ab polyprotein, Surface glycoprotein, Nucleocapsid protein etc. The functional effect on the structure and function of the protein can favourably or unfavourably interact with the host body.\n\nInterpretationThe fatality outcome depends on three important factors (a) number of mutation (b) rarity of the allelic variation and (c) functional consequence of the mutation at protein level. The molecular divergence, evolved from the ancestral strain (S) lead to extremely lethal (E), lethal(L) and non lethal (N) strains with the involvement of an Intermediate strain(I).","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuvam Banerjee","author_inst":"Environmental Epigenomics lab, University of Calcutta"},{"author_name":"Shrinjana Dhar","author_inst":"Environmental Epigenomics lab, University of Calcutta"},{"author_name":"Sandip Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"Health-Management in Occupational Health, Siemens, Gurgaon, India"},{"author_name":"Pritha Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"Environmental Epigenomics lab, University of Calcutta"},{"author_name":"Eugene Chekalin","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dexheimer","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Sze Chua","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Surender Rajasekaran","author_inst":"Helen Devos Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te Kent Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Sun","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Zhao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Ze Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.029769","rel_title":"Tocilizumab treatment in severe COVID-19 patients attenuates the inflammatory storm incited by monocyte centric immune interactions revealed by single-cell analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.029769","rel_abs":"ABSTRACTDespite the current devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, several recent studies have suggested that the immunosuppressive drug Tocilizumab can powerfully treating inflammatory responses that occur in this disease. Here, by employing single-cell analysis of the immune cell composition of severe-stage COVID-19 patients and these same patients in post Tocilizumab-treatment remission, we have identified a monocyte subpopulation specific to severe disease that contributes to inflammatory storms in COVID-19 patients. Although Tocilizumab treatment attenuated the strong inflammatory immune response, we found that immune cells including plasma B cells and CD8+ T cells still exhibited an intense humoral and cell-mediated anti-virus immune response in COVID-19 patients after Tocilizumab treatment. Thus, in addition to providing a rich, very high-resolution data resource about the immune cell distribution at multiple stages of the COVID-19 disease, our work both helps explain Tocilizumab\u2019s

COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV, the agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilizes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 host molecules for viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nTo determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples.\n\nWe demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa.\n\nCollectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer A Aguiar","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Jean-Marie Tremblay","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mansfield","author_inst":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Owen Woody","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Briallen Lobb","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Arinjay Banerjee","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Abiram Chandiramohan","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Tiessen","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Anna Dvorkin-Gheva","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Spencer Revill","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Matthew S Miller","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Christopher Carlsten","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Louise Organ","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Chitra Joseph","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Alison John","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Paul J Hanson","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Bruce M McManus","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Gisli Jenkins","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Karen Mossman","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Kjetil Ask","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Andrew C Doxey","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Jeremy A Hirota","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Jun Lin","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.030650","rel_title":"The spatial and cell-type distribution of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in human and mouse brain","rel_date":"2020-04-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.030650","rel_abs":"By engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2), the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may invade host cells in many organs, including the brain. However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. Here we investigated the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain transcriptome databases. According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some brain locations, such as the choroid plexus and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus. According to cell-type distribution analysis, nuclear expression of ACE2 was found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells) in human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. A few ACE2-expressing nuclei were found in a hippocampal dataset, and none were detected in the prefrontal cortex. Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2\/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brain, which indicates the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of inducing central nervous system symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

Although the use of ready-made reaction mixes can enable more rapid PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19, the need to transport and store these mixes at low temperatures presents challenges to already overburdened logistics networks. Here, we present an optimized freeze-drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration. We found that freeze-dried PCR mixes with [~]1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents.

Old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to alveolar damage, suggesting that lung senescence may increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Considering that human coronavirus (HCoVs; SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) require host cellular factors for infection and replication, we analyzed Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to test whether lung aging is associated with transcriptional changes in human protein-coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses. We found decreased expression of the gene tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) during aging in male individuals, and its protein was predicted to interact with HCoVs nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3 expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diogo de Moraes","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Brunno Vivone Buquete Paiva","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Sarah Santiloni Cury","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Joao Pessoa Araujo Jr.","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Alves da Silva Mori","author_inst":"State University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"},{"author_name":"Robson Francisco Carvalho","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fulai Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Minqi Gao","author_inst":"Wuxi Biortus Biosciences Co.

Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. We propose to identify mutational signatures of available SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. These signatures, Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. Through ISM compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and ORF1ab sites covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread.\n\nISMs are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. By analyzing sequence data available in the GISAID database, we validate the utility of ISM-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using ISMs to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In addition, we show the relationship of ISMs to phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and therefore, ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the Nextstrain [1] project. The developed pipeline dynamically generates ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on Github at https:\/\/github.com\/EESI\/ISM and via an interactive website at https:\/\/covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu\/.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, expanded to reportedly 8.7 million confirmed cases worldwide by June 21, 2020. The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the importance of tracking viral transmission dynamics in real-time. Through June 2020, researchers have obtained genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from over 47,000 samples from infected individuals worldwide. Since the virus readily mutates, each sequence of an infected individual contains useful information linked to the individuals exposure location and sample date. But, there are over 30,000 bases in the full SARS-CoV-2 genome--so tracking genetic variants on a whole-sequence basis becomes unwieldy. We describe a method to instead efficiently identify and label genetic variants, or \"subtypes\" of SARS-CoV-2. Applying this method results in a compact, 11 base-long compressed label, called an Informative Subtype Marker or \"ISM\". We define viral subtypes for each ISM, and show how regional distribution of subtypes track the progress of the pandemic. Major findings include (1) covarying nucleotides with the spike protein which has spread rapidly and (2) tracking emergence of a local subtype across the United States connected to Asia and distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is found to be connected to Europe.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhengqiao Zhao","author_inst":"Drexel University"},{"author_name":"Bahrad A.

A strategy for improved drug therapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2 by preferential damage to the viral proteome. Key reactive metabolites producing major quantitative damage to the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive glycating agent methylglyoxal (MG); cysteine residues and arginine residues are their most susceptible targets, respectively. From sequenced-based prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we found 0.8-fold enrichment or depletion of cysteine residues in functional domains of the viral proteome; whereas there was a 4.6-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to oxidative agents and sensitive to MG. For arginine residues of the SARS-CoV-2 predicted to be in functional domains, we examined which are activated towards modification by MG - residues with predicted or expected low pKa by neighbouring group in interactions. We found 25 such arginine residues, including 2 in the spike protein and 10 in the nucleoprotein. These sites were partially conserved in related coronaviridae: SARS-COV and MERS. Finally, we identified drugs which increase cellular MG concentration to virucidal levels: antitumor drugs with historical antiviral activity, doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Our findings provide evidence of potential vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to inactivation by MG and a scientific rationale for repurposing of doxorubicin and paclitaxel for treatment of COVID-19 disease, providing efficacy and adequate therapeutic index may be established.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maryam Al-Motawa","author_inst":"Hamad Bin Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Abbas","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wijten","author_inst":"Hamad Bin Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Alberto de la Fuente","author_inst":"Hamad Bin Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Mingzhan Xue","author_inst":"Hamad Bin Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Naila Rabbani","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Paul Thornalley","author_inst":"Hamad Bin Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Fulai Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Minqi Gao","author_inst":"Wuxi Biortus Biosciences Co.

A convenient and reliable in vitro neutralization assay is very important for the development of neutralizing antibodies, vaccines and other inhibitors. In this study, G protein-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVdG) bearing full-length and truncated spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. The virus packaging efficiency of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 (S with C-terminal 18 amino acid truncation) is much higher than VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S. A neutralization assay for antibody screening and serum neutralizing titer quantification was established based on VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 pseudovirus and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) overexpressed BHK21 cell (BHK21-hACE2). The experimental results can be obtained by automatically counting EGFP positive cell number at 12 hours after infection, making the assay convenient and high-throughput. The serum neutralizing titer of COVID-19 convalescent patients measured by VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 pseudovirus assay has a good correlation with live SARS-CoV-2 assay. Seven neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2-S were obtained. This efficient and reliable pseudovirus assay model could facilitate the development of new drugs and vaccines.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hualong Xiong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yangtao Wu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jiali Cao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ren Yang","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Jian Ma","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Qiao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xiangyang Yao","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baohui Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yali Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wangheng Hou","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yang Shi","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Xu","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baorong Fu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Yang","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baoying Huang","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianying Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20055426","rel_title":"Understanding the CoVID-19 pandemic Curve through statistical approach","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20055426","rel_abs":"Current research is an attempt to understand the CoVID-19 pandemic curve through statistical approach of probability density function with associated skewness and kurtosis measures, change point detection and polynomial fitting to estimate infected population along with 30 days projection.

The global cases infection as well as recovery rate curves remained in the ranged of 0 - 9.89 and 0 - 8.89%, respectively. The confirmed cases probability density curve is high positive skewed and leptokurtic with mean global infected daily population of 6620. The recovered cases showed bimodal positive skewed curve of leptokurtic type with daily recovery of 1708. The change point detection helped to understand the CoVID-19 curve in term of sudden change in term of mean or mean with variance. This pointed out disease curve is consist of three phases and last segment that varies in term of day lengths. The mean with variance based change detection is better in differentiating phases and associated segment length as compared to mean.

We sought to test the ability of 4 different decontamination methods including autoclave treatment, ethylene oxide gassing, ionized hydrogen peroxide fogging and vaporized hydrogen peroxide exposure to decontaminate 4 different N95 masks of experimental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 or vesicular stomatitis virus as a surrogate. In addition, we sought to determine whether masks would tolerate repeated cycles of decontamination while maintaining structural and functional integrity. We found that one cycle of treatment with all modalities was effective in decontamination and was associated with no structural or functional deterioration. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatment was tolerated to at least 5 cycles by masks. Most notably, standard autoclave treatment was associated with no loss of structural or functional integrity to a minimum of 10 cycles for the 3 pleated mask models. The molded N95 mask however tolerated only 1 cycle. This last finding may be of particular use to institutions globally due to the virtually universal accessibility of autoclaves in health care settings.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anand Kumar","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Samantha B.

This study assessed the predictors and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) among individuals with COVID-19. Methods: This observational study, included data on all patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 5 to March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was censored on March 8, 2020. This is a single-center, retrospective, observational study. Patients clinically confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 5 to March 8, 2020 were enrolled. We evaluated the association between changes in the incidence of AKI and COVID-19 disease and clinical outcomes by using logistic regression models. Results: A total of 287 patients, 55 with AKI and 232 without AKI, were included in the analysis. Compared to patients without AKI, AKI patients were older, predominantly male, and were more likely to present with hypoxia and have pre-existing hypertension and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, AKI patients had higher levels of white blood cells, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, a higher prevalence of hyperkalemia, lower lymphocyte counts, and higher chest computed tomographic scores. The incidence of stage 1 AKI was 14.3%, and the incidence of stage 2 or 3 AKI was 4.9%. Patients with AKI had substantially higher mortality. Conclusions: AKI is an important complication of COVID-19. Older age, male, multiple pre-existing comorbidities, lymphopenia, increased infection indicators, elevated D-dimer, and impaired heart and liver functions were the risk factors of AKI. AKI patients who progressed to stages 2 or 3 AKI had a higher mortality rate. Prevention of AKI and monitoring of kidney function is very important for COVID 19 patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guanhua Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Chronic Airways Diseases Laboratory, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Hu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Feng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tong Sha","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qiaobing Huang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Shock and Microcirculation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haijun Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Hankou Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Jiafa Han","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Hankou Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Wenhong Song","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Hankou Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Zhongqing Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhenhua Zeng","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital ofouthern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jay Krishnan","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg Canada"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Xu","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baorong Fu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Yang","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baoying Huang","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianying Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20055103","rel_title":"The impact of early social distancing at COVID-19 Outbreak in the largest Metropolitan Area of Brazil.","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20055103","rel_abs":"We evaluated the impact of early social distancing on the COVID-19 transmission in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area.

We aimed to obtain a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected patients reported to the Brazilian surveillance system. Methods: We analyzed suspected patients reported to the National Surveillance System that corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms and fever, who traveled to regions with local or community transmission or who had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case. Based on variables routinely collected, we obtained a multiple model using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy indicators were used for validation. Results: We described 1468 COVID-19 cases (confirmed by RT-PCR) and 4271 patients with other illnesses. With a data subset, including 80% of patients from Sao Paulo (SP) and Rio Janeiro (RJ), we obtained a function which reached an AUC of 95.54% (95% CI: 94.41% - 96.67%) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and accuracy of 90.1% (sensitivity 87.62% and specificity 92.02%). In a validation dataset including the other 20% of patients from SP and RJ, this model exhibited an AUC of 95.01% (92.51% - 97.5%) and accuracy of 89.47% (sensitivity 87.32% and specificity 91.36%).

We tabulated the cases of physician deaths from COVID-19 associated with front-line work in hopes of mitigating future events. METHOD: On April 5, 2020, Google internet search was performed using the keywords doctor, physician, death, COVID, COVID-19, and coronavirus in English and Farsi, and in Chinese using the Baidu search engine. RESULTS: We found 198 physician deaths from COVID-19, but complete details were missing for 49 individuals. The average age of the physicians that died was 63.4 years (range 28 to 90 years) and the median age was 66 years of age. Ninety percent of the deceased physicians were male (175\/194). General practitioners and emergency room doctors (78\/192), respirologists (5\/192), internal medicine specialists (11\/192) and anesthesiologists (6\/192) comprised 52% of those dying. Two percent of the deceased were epidemiologists (4\/192), 2% were infectious disease specialists (4\/192), 5% were dentists (9\/192), 4% were ENT (8\/192), and 4% were ophthalmologists (7\/192). The countries with the most reported physician deaths were Italy (79\/198), Iran (43\/198), China (16\/198), Philippines (14\/198), United States (9\/192) and Indonesia (7\/192). CONCLUSION: Physicians from all specialties may die from COVID, and these deaths will likely increase as the pandemic progresses. Lack of personal protective equipment was cited as a common cause of death. Consideration should be made to exclude older physicians from front-line work.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edsel B Ing","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Alis Qinyuan Xu","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Ali Salimi","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Nurhan Torun","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconness, Ophthalmology"},{"author_name":"Andrea Liliana Vesga-Varela","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo, School of Public Health, Postgraduate Student in Public Heath."},{"author_name":"Julio Croda","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Fredi A Diaz-Quijano","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Julio Croda","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Zhongqing Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhenhua Zeng","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital ofouthern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jay Krishnan","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg Canada"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Xu","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baorong Fu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Yang","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baoying Huang","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianying Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20053272","rel_title":"Connecting BCG Vaccination and COVID-19: Additional Data","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20053272","rel_abs":"The reasons for a wide variation in severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the affected countries of the world are not known. Two recent studies have suggested a link between the BCG vaccination policy and the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. In the present study we compared the impact of COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates (CFR) between countries with high disease burden and those with BCG revaccination policies presuming that revaccination practices would have provided added protection to the population against severe COVID-19. We found a significant difference in the CFR between the two groups of countries.

These underscored the imperative for strong and immediate measures to slow the spread of infection. In the coming weeks, however, as policymakers continue enlisting models to inform decisions on COVID-19, answers to the most difficult and pressing policy questions will be much more sensitive to underlying uncertainties. In this study, we demonstrate a model-based approach to assessing the potential value of reducing critical uncertainties most salient to COVID-19 decision-making and discuss priorities for acquiring new data to reduce these uncertainties. We demonstrate how information about the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions could narrow prediction intervals around hospitalizations over the next few weeks, while information about the prevalence of undetected cases could narrow prediction intervals around the timing and height of the peak of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Statistics,

U.S. coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic may have notable health and social impacts. Methods and Findings: We conducted a longitudinal pretest-posttest comparison group study to estimate the change in COVID-19 case growth before versus after implementation of statewide social distancing measures in the U.S. The primary exposure was time before (14 days prior to, and up to 3 days after) versus after (beginning 4 days after, and up to 21 days after) implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures. Statewide restrictions on internal movement were examined as a secondary exposure. The primary outcome was the COVID-19 case growth rate. The secondary outcome was the COVID-19-attributed mortality growth rate. All states initiated social distancing measures between March 10-25, 2020. The mean daily COVID-19 case growth rate decreased beginning four days after implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures, by 0.9% per day (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3% to -0.4%; P<0.001). We did not estimate a statistically significant difference in the mean daily case growth rate before versus after implementation of statewide restrictions on internal movement (0.1% per day; 95% CI, -0.04% to 0.3%, P=0.14), but there is significant difficulty in disentangling the unique associations with statewide restrictions on internal movement from the unique associations with the first social distancing measures. Beginning seven days after social distancing, the COVID-19-attributed mortality growth rate decreased by 1.7% per day (95% CI, 3.0% to -0.7%; P<0.001). Our analysis is susceptible to potential bias resulting from the aggregate nature of the ecological data, potential confounding by contemporaneous changes (e.g., increases in testing), and potential underestimation of social distancing due to spillovers across neighboring states. Conclusions: Statewide social distancing measures were associated with a decrease in the COVID-19 epidemic case growth rate that was statistically significant and a decrease in the COVID-19-attributed mortality growth rate that was not statistically significant.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark J Siedner","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guy Harling","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Zahra Reynolds","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rebecca F Gilbert","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Haneuse","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

Methods: The R0 of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The serial interval was fit with a gamma distribution. The probable incidence and cumulative incidence in the next 30 days were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using earlyR and projections packages in R software. Results: The maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1 to 3.4) for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) by the end of the day 41. The expected average number of new cases in Shahroud is 9.0 case\/day with a standard deviation of 3.8, which means an estimated total of 271 (95% CI: 178-383) new cases in the next 30 days. Conclusions: It is essential to reduce the R0 to values below one. Therefore, we strongly recommend enforcing and continuing the current preventive measures, restricting travel, and providing screening tests for a larger proportion of the population.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmad Khosravi","author_inst":"Ophthalmic Epidemiology Research Center, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran"},{"author_name":"Reza Chaman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran"},{"author_name":"Marzieh Rohani-Rasaf","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran"},{"author_name":"Fariba Zare","author_inst":"Center for Health Related Social and Behavioral Sciences Research, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran."},{"author_name":"Shiva Mehravaran","author_inst":"ASCEND Center for Biomedical Research, Morgan State University, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Hassan Emamian","author_inst":"Ophthalmic Epidemiology Research Center, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran"},{"author_name":"Alexander C Tsai","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Josep Redon","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jaime Signes-Costa","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"David Navarro","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jay Krishnan","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg Canada"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Xu","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baorong Fu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Yang","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baoying Huang","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianying Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052845","rel_title":"Use Crow-AMSAA Method to predict the cases of the Coronavirus 19 in Michigan and U.S.A","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052845","rel_abs":"The Crow-AMSAA method is used in engineering reliability world to predict the failures and evaluate the reliability growth.

ELIGIBLE DATA: Countries and US states with at least 800 COVID-19 deaths as of April 24, 2020 and with information on the number of deaths in people with age <65. Data were available for 11 European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK), Canada, and 12 US states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and New York) We also examined available data on COVID-19 deaths in people with age <65 and no underlying diseases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of COVID-19 deaths in people <65 years old; relative risk of COVID-19 death in people <65 versus [&ge;]65 years old; absolute risk of COVID-19 death in people <65 and in those [&ge;]80 years old in the general population as of May 1, 2020; absolute COVID-19 death risk expressed as equivalent of death risk from driving a motor vehicle. RESULTS: Individuals with age <65 account for 4.8-9.3% of all COVID-19 deaths in 10 European countries and Canada, 13.0% in the UK, and 7.8-23.9% in the US locations. People <65 years old had 36- to 84-fold lower risk of COVID-19 death than those [&ge;]65 years old in 10 European countries and Canada and 14- to 56-fold lower risk in UK and US locations. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death as of May 1, 2020 for people <65 years old ranged from 6 (Canada) to 249 per million (New York City). The absolute risk of COVID-19 death for people [&ge;]80 years old ranged from 0.3 (Florida) to 10.6 per thousand (New York). The COVID-19 death risk in people <65 years old during the period of fatalities from the epidemic was equivalent to the death risk from driving between 13 and 101 miles per day for 11 countries and 6 states, and was higher (equivalent to the death risk from driving 143-668 miles per day) for 6 other states and the UK. People <65 years old without underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.7-2.6% of all COVID-19 deaths (data available from France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Georgia, and New York City). CONCLUSIONS: People <65 years old have very small risks of COVID-19 death even in pandemic epicenters and deaths for people <65 years without underlying predisposing conditions are remarkably uncommon. Strategies focusing specifically on protecting high-risk elderly individuals should be considered in managing the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John P. A.
