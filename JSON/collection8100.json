The FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative previously funded a study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators using a Clarus C system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) which normally is used to fumigate hospital rooms. The process preserved respirator function, but it is unknown if HP vapor would be virucidal since respirators have porous fabric that may harbor virus. We evaluated the virucidal activity of HP vapor using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) after inoculating 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) with 3 aerosolized bacteriophage that are a reasonable proxy for SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation resulted in contamination of the respirator with 9.87e4 plaque forming units (PFU) of phage phi-6, 4.17e7 PFU of phage T7 and 1.35e7 PFU of phage T1. Respirators were reprocessed with BQ-50 with a long aeration phase to reduce HP vapors. Virucidal activity was measured by a standard plaquing assay prior to and after sterilization. A single HP vapor cycle resulted in complete eradication of phage from masks (limit of detection 10 PFU, lower than the infectious dose of the majority of respiratory viral pathogens). After 5 cycles, the respirators appeared similar to new with no deformity. Use of a Bioquell machine can be scaled to permit simultaneous sterilization of a large number of used but otherwise intact respirators. HP vapor reprocessing may ease shortages and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative to non-NIOSH masks.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Kenney","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Benjamin K Chan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Kortright","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Margaret Cintron","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Nancy Havill","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Mark Russi","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jaqueline Epright","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Lorraine Lee","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Thomas Balcezak","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health System"},{"author_name":"Richard Martinello","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20040998","rel_title":"A demographic adjustment to improve measurement of COVID-19 severity at the developing stage of the pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20040998","rel_abs":"The need for accurate statistics has never been felt so deeply as the novel COVID-19 pathogen spreads around the world and quantifying its severity is a primary clinical and public health issue. In Italy, the magnitude and increasing trend of the case-fatality risk (CFR) is fueling the already high levels of public alarm. In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age. When applied to publicly released data for Italy, we show that until March 16 our adjusted CFR was similar to that of Wuhan, the most affected Chinese region, where COVID-19 has now been contained. This indicates that our adjusted CFR improves its comparability over time, making an important tool to chart the course of the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. Since March 16, the Italian COVID-19 outbreak has entered a new phase, with the northern and southern regions following different trajectories. As a result, our adjusted CFR has been increasing between March 16 and March 20. Data at the subnational level are needed to correctly assess the disease severity in the country at this stage.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simona Bignami","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Daniela Ghio","author_inst":"Joint Research Center European Commission"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Kortright","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Margaret Cintron","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Nancy Havill","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Mark Russi","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jaqueline Epright","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Lorraine Lee","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health"},{"author_name":"Thomas Balcezak","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health System"},{"author_name":"Richard Martinello","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20041020","rel_title":"Systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 infection","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20041020","rel_abs":"Objective To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of models that aim to predict either (i) presence of existing COVID-19 infection, (ii) future complications in individuals already diagnosed with COVID-19, or (iii) models to identify individuals at high risk for COVID-19 in the general population. Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 24th March 2020. Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full text. Data extraction Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and prediction model performance. Results 2696 titles were screened. Of these, 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included for data extraction and critical appraisal. We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models to detect COVID-19 infection in symptomatic individuals (13 of which were machine learning utilising computed tomography (CT) results); and ten prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to a severe state, or length of hospital stay. Only one of these studies used data on COVID-19 cases outside of China. Most reported predictors of presence of COVID-19 in suspected patients included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. Most reported predictors of severe prognosis in infected patients included age, sex, features derived from CT, C-reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. Estimated C-index estimates for the prediction models ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in those for the general population (reported for all 3 general population models), from 0.81 to > 0.99 in those for diagnosis (reported for 13 of the 18 diagnostic models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in those for prognosis (reported for 6 of the 10 prognostic models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and poor statistical analysis, including high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. A description of the study population and intended use of the models was absent in almost all reports, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion COVID-19 related prediction models are quickly entering the academic literature, to support medical decision making at a time where this is urgently needed. Our review indicates proposed models are poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Thus, their reported performance is likely optimistic and using them to support medical decision making is not advised. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed prediction models and validating (evaluating) existing models. The aforementioned predictors identified in multiple included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. We also stress the need to follow methodological guidance when developing and validating prediction models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD statement to facilitate validating, appraising, advocating and clinically using the reported models.

Although SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients, their dynamics and association with outcomes have not been characterized. Methods: A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins tested in Tongji hospital were retrospectively investigated. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and outcomes data were compared between mild-moderate group and died group. Further, a paired case-control study was conducted where each deceased case was matched to three mild-moderate patients of similar age. Findings: Among 116 subjects included, 101 mild-moderate patients survived and 15 cases died. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, while serum IgG levels increased over 8 weeks. Serum IgM levels were higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.024), but not IgG. Serum IgM levels were negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and albumin levels (r = -0.269, P = 0.003; r = -0.188, P = 0.043; and r = -0.198, P = 0.033, resp.). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for IgM antibody was 0.681 (95% CI: 0.517-0.845, P = 0.024). In case-control study paired by age, serum IgM was higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.019), positively correlated with leucocyte count (r = 0.260, P = 0.045), while negatively correlated with clinical outcome and albumin levels (r = -0.337, P = 0.008; r = -0.265, P = 0.041). AUC for IgM levels was 0.704 (95% CI: 0.534-0.873, P = 0.019). Interpretation: These results indicate that dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies was similar with that of SARS-CoV, while elevated serum IgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhihua Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huijun Li","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Li","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chunguang Yang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Guo","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhiquan Hu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Chen","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shaogang Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Richard D Riley","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ewoud Schuit","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Luc Smits","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Kym IE Snell","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ewout W Steyerberg","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Christine Wallisch","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Maarten van Smeden","author_inst":"Utrecht University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041244","rel_title":"Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041244","rel_abs":"Following the outbreak of novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 in Wuhan, China late 2019, different countries have put in place interventions such as travel ban, proper hygiene, and social distancing to slow the spread of this novel virus.

However, studies about risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the potential impact of Lopinavir\/Ritonavir (LPV\/r) treatment remain scarce. Methods: In this retrospective study, data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had RT-PCR conversion at the NO.3 People's hospital of Hubei province between 31 January and 09 March 2020. We compared clinical features and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients with LPV\/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. Results: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV\/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18-32 days). Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and lack of LPV\/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The median duration of viral shedding was shorter in the LPV\/r treatment group (n=78) than that in no LPV\/r treatment group (n=42) (median, 22 days vs. 28.5 days, p=0.02). Only earlier administration of LPV\/r treatment ([&le;]10 days from symptom onset) could shorten the duration of viral shedding. Conclusions: Older age and lack of LPV\/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19. Earlier administration of LPV\/r treatment could shorten viral shedding.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Yan","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People Hospital of Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao-yan Liu","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People Hospital of Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Ya-nan Zhu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"},{"author_name":"Li Huang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"},{"author_name":"Bi-tang Dan","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People Hospital of Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Guo-jun Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"},{"author_name":"Yong-hua Gao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"},{"author_name":"Shaogang Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Richard D Riley","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ewoud Schuit","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Luc Smits","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Kym IE Snell","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ewout W Steyerberg","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Christine Wallisch","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Maarten van Smeden","author_inst":"Utrecht University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041970","rel_title":"Haplotype networks of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041970","rel_abs":"The Diamond Princess (DP) cruise ship was put under quarantine offshore Yokohama, Japan, after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was confirmed as a COVID-19 case.

Unfortunately, information regarding the immunological characteristics in COVID-19 patients remains limited. Here we collected the blood samples from 18 healthy donors (HD) and 38 COVID-19 patients to analyze changes in the adaptive immune cell populations and phenotypes. In comparison to HD, the lymphocyte percentage was slightly decreased, the percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lymphocytes are similar, whereas B cell percentage increased in COVID-19 patients. T cells, especially CD8 T cells, showed an enhanced expression of late activation marker CD25 and exhaustion marker PD-1. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 induced an increased percentage of T follicular helpher (Tfh)- and germinal center B-like (GCB-like) cells in the blood. However, the parameters in COVD-19 patients remained unchanged across various age groups. Therefore, we demonstrated that the T and B cells can be activated normally and exhibit functional features. These data provide a clue that the adaptive immunity in most people could be primed to induce a significant immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection upon receiving standard medical care.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Yang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Tongxin Dai","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061 China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Qian","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061 China"},{"author_name":"Rui Guo","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061 China"},{"author_name":"Lei Lei","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Xingzhe Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Dan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Lin Shi","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Yanbin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Yaling Guo","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061 China"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Hu","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061, China"},{"author_name":"Baojun Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hideki Hasegawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041277","rel_title":"Critical Care for Patients with Severe Covid-2019 in Sichuan Province, China: Provincial Cohort Study","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041277","rel_abs":"Background Data regarding critical care for patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. We aimed to describe the clinical course, multi-strategy management, and respiratory support usage for the severe COVID-19 at the provincial level. Methods Using data from Sichuan Provincial Department of Health and the multicentre cohort study, all microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients in Sichuan who met the national severe criteria were included and followed-up from the day of inclusion (D1), until discharge, death, or the end of the study. Findings Out of 539 COVID-19 patients, 81 severe cases (15.0%) were identified. The median (IQR) age was 50 (39-65) years, 37% were female, and 53.1% had chronic comorbidities. All severe cases were identified before requiring mechanical ventilation and treated in the intensive care units (ICUs), among whom 51 (63.0%) were treated in provisional ICUs and 77 patients (95.1%) were admitted by D1. On D1, 76 (93.8%) were administered by respiratory support, including 55 (67.9%) by conventional oxygen therapy (COT), 8 (9.9%) by high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and 13 (16.0%) by non-invasive ventilation (NIV). By D28, 53 (65.4%) were discharged, three (3.7%) were deceased, and 25 (30.9%) were still hospitalized. COT, administered to 95.1% of the patients, was the most commonly used respiratory support and met 62.7% of the respiratory support needed, followed by HFNC (19.3%), NIV ventilation (9.4%) and IV 8.5%. Interpretation The multi-strategy management for severe COVID-19 patients including early identification and timely critical care may contribute to the low case-fatailty. Preparation of sufficient conventional oxygen equipment should be prioritized.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuelian Liao","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"The Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhen Li","author_inst":"Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Weimin Li","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zongan Liang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Tang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040956","rel_title":"Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20040956","rel_abs":"Background: The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the state of the disease based on existing data. Building on the generic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework we incorporate two behavioral and logistical considerations. First we capture the endogenous changes in contact rate (average contact per person) as more death are reported. As a result the reproduction number changes endogenously in the model. Second we differentiate reported and true cases by including simple formulations for how only a fraction of cases might be diagnosed, and how that fraction changes in response to epidemic's progression. In estimating the model we use both the official data as well as the discovered infected travelers and unofficial medical community estimates and triangulate these sources to build a more complete picture. Calibration is completed by forming a likelihood function for observing the actual time series data conditional on model parameters, and conducting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model is used to estimate current \"true\" cases of infection and death. We analyze the future trajectory of the disease under six conditions related to the seasonal effects and policy measures targeting social distancing. Findings: The model closely replicates the past data but also shows the true number of cases is likely far larger. We estimate about 493,000 current infected cases (90% CI: 271K-810K) as of March 20th, 2020. Our estimate for cumulative cases of infection until that date is 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M), and for total death is 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K). These numbers are significantly (more than one order of magnitude) higher than official statistics. The trajectory of the epidemic until the end of June could take various paths depending on the impact of seasonality and policies targeting social distancing. In the most optimistic scenario for seasonal effects, depending on policy measures, 1.6 million Iranians (90% CI: 0.9M-2.6M) are likely to get infected, and death toll will reach about 58,000 cases (90% CI: 32K-97K), while in the more pessimistic scenarios, death toll may exceed 103,000 cases (90% CI: 56K-172K). Implication: Our results suggest that the number of cases and deaths may be over an order of magnitude larger than official statistics in Iran. Absent extended testing capacity other countries may face a significant under-count of existing cases and thus be caught off guard about the actual toll of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Navid Ghaffarzadegan","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"},{"author_name":"Hazhir Rahmandad","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhen Li","author_inst":"Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Weimin Li","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zongan Liang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Tang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041111","rel_title":"Exponential damping key to successful containment of COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041111","rel_abs":"Due to its excessively high capacity for human-to-human transmission, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first reported in Wuhan in China, spread rapidly to the entire nation and beyond, and has now been declared a global public health emergency. Understanding the transmission pattern of the virus and the efficacy of transmission control measures is crucial to ensuring regional and global disease control. Here we propose a simple model based on exponential infectious growth, but with a time-varying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data from the 102 countries and regions which have reported cases for more than 6 days, and, we think, has largely captured the transmission patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. We found that the damping rate, defined as the rate of the exponential decline in transmission rate, ranged from -0.125 to 0.513 d-1 globally (a negative damping rate represents acceleration in spread). The estimated peak time (when the fastest spread occurs) and the final number of infections were found to be greatly affected by the damping rate. Successful control measures, such as those implemented in China and South Korea, have resulted in a clear pattern of exponential damping in the viral spread (also shown during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The damping rate, therefore, could be used as an indicator for the efficacy of implemented control measures. Our model suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak is currently accelerating worldwide, especially rapidly in certain countries (e.g. USA and Australia) where exponential damping is yet to emerge. Consistent with the message from the World Health Organisation (WHO), we thus strongly suggest all countries to take active measures to contain this global pandemic. Slight increments in the damping rate from additional control efforts, especially in countries showing weak or no exponential damping in COVID-19 transmission, could lead to a radically more positive outcome in the fight to contain the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Anhui University"},{"author_name":"Jinmei Zhang","author_inst":"Xiguan Community Health Center of Liangzhou"},{"author_name":"Menglan Cao","author_inst":"Anhui University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"Anhui University"},{"author_name":"Cang Hui","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Weimin Li","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zongan Liang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Tang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041517","rel_title":"Spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 pandemics","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041517","rel_abs":"The new coronavirus known as COVID-19 is spread world-wide since December 2019.

We provide a comprehensive picture of the spatial propagation from Hubei to other provinces in China in terms of distance, population size, and human mobility and their scaling relations. Since strict quarantine has been usually applied between cities, more insight about the temporal evolution of the disease can be obtained by analyzing the epidemic within cities, especially the time evolution of the infection, death, and recovery rates which affected by policies. We study and compare the infection rate in different cities in China and provinces in Italy and find that the disease spread is characterized by a two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate is close to a constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection symptoms are observed. Then at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. The time evolution of the death and recovery rates also distinguish between these two stages and reflect the health system situation which could be overloaded.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bnaya Gross","author_inst":"Bar Ilan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiguo Zheng","author_inst":"School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Shiyan Liu","author_inst":"School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Chen","author_inst":"School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Alon Sela","author_inst":"Department of Industrial Engineering, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing 100083, China"},{"author_name":"Daqing Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Shlomo Havlin","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan 52900, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041863","rel_title":"Modelling strategies to organize healthcare workforce during pandemics: application to COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041863","rel_abs":"Protection of healthcare workforce who are at increased risk to become infected is of paramount relevance for the care of patients in the setting of a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. The models were designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivity depending on the infection rate, the presence of reinfection and the efficiency of home office and apply our theory to the case of COVID-19. The results reveal that a desynchronization strategy in which two medical teams work alternating for 7 days increases the available workforce.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Sanchez-Taltavull","author_inst":"Department for Visceral Surgery and Medicine, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Candinas","author_inst":"Department for Visceral Surgery and Medicine, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Edgar Roldan","author_inst":"The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Guido Beldi","author_inst":"Department for Visceral Surgery and Medicine, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alon Sela","author_inst":"Department of Industrial Engineering, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing 100083, China"},{"author_name":"Daqing Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Shlomo Havlin","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan 52900, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041145","rel_title":"Global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2: from outbreak to pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041145","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people's movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. Methods: We employ molecular surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial-temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic. We exploited a network-based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up-to-date picture of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between and within countries and geographic regions. Results and Conclusions: The analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale-free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs. The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pavel Skums","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Kirpich","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Pelin Icer Baykal","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Alex Zelikovsky","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing 100083, China"},{"author_name":"Daqing Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Shlomo Havlin","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan 52900, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041004","rel_title":"COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041004","rel_abs":"The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human societies.

Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also preserving socioeconomic activity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew J.

Tracking case numbers over time allows us to determine speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. Changing case definitions during an epidemic can affect these inferences. Methods: We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used simple models assuming exponential growth and then exponential decay to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the numbers of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. Findings: From January through to early March 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. As of February 20, there were 55,508 confirmed cases reported in mainland China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed from version 1 to 2, version 2 to 4 and version 4 to 5, the proportion of infections being detected as cases were increased by 7.1-fold (95% credible interval (CI): 4.8, 10.9), 2.8-fold (95% CI: 1.9, 4.2) and 4.2-fold (95% CI: 2.6, 7.3) respectively. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak, we estimated that by February 20 there would have been 232,000 (95% CI: 161,000, 359,000) confirmed cases. Interpretation: The case definition was initially narrow, but was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan or other known cases. This should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) increases exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to extend the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment as safely as possible are critically important. In the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve PPE, including decontamination after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to decontaminate N95 respirators and other PPE, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which PPE may be decontaminated using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories, and discuss the dose ranges needed for effective decontamination of critical PPE. We further discuss obstacles to this approach including the possibility that the UV radiation levels vary within BSCs. Effective decontamination of N95 respirator masks or surgical masks requires UV-C doses of greater than 1 Jcm-2, which would take a minimum of 4.3 hours per side when placing the N95 at the bottom of the BSCs tested in this study. Elevating the N95 mask by 48 cm (so that it lies 19 cm from the top of the BSC) would enable the delivery of germicidal doses of UV-C in 62 minutes per side. Effective decontamination of face shields likely requires a much lower UV-C dose, and may be achieved by placing the face shields at the bottom of the BSC for 20 minutes per side. Our results are intended to provide support to healthcare organizations looking for alternative methods to extend their reserves of PPE. We recognize that institutions will require robust quality control processes to guarantee the efficacy of any implemented decontamination protocol. We also recognize that in certain situations such institutional resources may not be available; while we subscribe to the general principle that some degree of decontamination is preferable to re-use without decontamination, we would strongly advise that in such cases at least some degree of on-site verification of UV dose delivery be performed","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- Theory Division, Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kyle J Card","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Dena Crozier","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Andrew Dhawan","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mina Dinh","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Emily Dolson","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nathan Farrokhian","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vishhvaan Gopalakrishnan","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Emily Ho","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tanush Jagdish","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Eshan S King","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Krishnan","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Gleb Kuzmin","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jeff Maltas","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jinhan Mo","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Julia Pelesko","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Scarborough","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob G Scott","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Geoff Sedor","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Enze Tian","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Davis T Weaver","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041707","rel_title":"Serology characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection since the exposure and post symptoms onset","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041707","rel_abs":"Background Timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the prerequisite for treatment and preventive quarantine. The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of antibody test to RNA test needs to be demonstrated. Method A patient cohort study was conducted at the first affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Serial sera of COVID-19 patients were collected and total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected. The antibody dynamics during the infection were described. Results The seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients was 98.8% (79\/80), 93.8% (75\/80) and 93.8% (75\/80), respectively. The first detectible serology marker is total antibody and followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 day post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset, separately. The antibody levels increased rapidly since 6 d.p.o and accompanied with the decline of viral load. For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7d.p.o),Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to the IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p<0.001). The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG detection increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% two weeks later, respectively. Conclusions Typical acute antibody response is induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serology testing provides important complementation to RNA test for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patient. It should be strongly recommended to apply well-validated antibody tests in the clinical management and public health practice to improve the control of COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bin Lou","author_inst":"Zhejaing University"},{"author_name":"Tigndong Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shufa Zheng","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Su","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Yu","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qianda Zou","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Sha Lin","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Congming Hong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xiangyang Yao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xuejie Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Dinghui Wu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhou","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wangheng Hou","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tingting Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yali Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shiyin Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Fan","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042234","rel_title":"Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM):A Novel Mechanical Ventilator Designed for Mass Scale Production in response to the COVID-19 Pandemics","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20042234","rel_abs":"We present here the design of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM), a novel mechan- ical ventilator designed for mass scale production in response to the COVID-19 pandemics, to compensate for the dramatic shortage of such ventilators in many countries.

Our design is optimized to permit large sale production in short time and at a limited cost, relying on off-the-shelf components, readily available worldwide from hardware suppliers. Operation of the MVM requires only a source of compressed oxygen (or compressed medical air) and electrical power. The MVM control and monitoring unit can be connected and networked via WiFi so that no additional electrical connections are necessary other than the connection to the electrical power. At this stage the MVM is not a certified medical device. Construction of the first proto- types is starting with a team of engineers, scientists and computing experts. The purpose of this paper is to disseminate the conceptual design of the MVM broadly and to solicit feed- back from the scientific and medical community to speed the process of review, improvement and possible implementation.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Galbiati Cristiano","author_inst":"Physics Department, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA"},{"author_name":"Walter Bonivento","author_inst":"INFN Cagliari, Cagliari 09042, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mauro Caravati","author_inst":"INFN Cagliari, Cagliari 09042, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Razeti","author_inst":"INFN Cagliari, Cagliari 09042, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sandro DeCecco","author_inst":"Physics Department, Sapienza Universit`a di Roma, Roma 00185, Italy and INFN Sezione di Roma, Roma 00185, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Fiorillo","author_inst":"Physics Department, Universita degli Studi Federico II di Napoli, Napoli 80126, Italy and INFN Napoli, Napoli 80126, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Gabriele","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Tartaglia","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Razeto","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Sablone","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Scapparone","author_inst":"INFN Bologna, Bologna 40126, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gemma Testera","author_inst":"INFN Genova, Genova 16146, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Rescigno","author_inst":"INFN Sezione di Roma, Roma 00185, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Franco","author_inst":"APC, Universite Paris Diderot, CNRS\/IN2P3, CEA\/Irfu, Obs de Paris, USPC, Paris 75205, France"},{"author_name":"Iza Kochanek","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cary Kendziora","author_inst":"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL 60510, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen H.

The SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closely related to the SARS-CoV, based on the genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures. Plausible binding modes between human ACE2 and the RBD were revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data further revealed critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Two mutants mimicking rat ACE2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2. The simulations showed that the N-terminal helix and the K353 of the human ACE2 alter the binding modes of the CoV2-RBD to the ACE2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cecylia Lupala","author_inst":"Beijing Computational Science Research Center"},{"author_name":"Xuanxuan Li","author_inst":"Beijing Computational Science Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jian Lei","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Jianxun Qi","author_inst":"CAS"},{"author_name":"Haiguang Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Computational Science Research Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Su","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Roberto Tartaglia","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Razeto","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Sablone","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Scapparone","author_inst":"INFN Bologna, Bologna 40126, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gemma Testera","author_inst":"INFN Genova, Genova 16146, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Rescigno","author_inst":"INFN Sezione di Roma, Roma 00185, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Franco","author_inst":"APC, Universite Paris Diderot, CNRS\/IN2P3, CEA\/Irfu, Obs de Paris, USPC, Paris 75205, France"},{"author_name":"Iza Kochanek","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cary Kendziora","author_inst":"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL 60510, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen H.

Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences. This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and\/or incomplete segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented.\n\nNoteThe main ideas and results of this research were first presented at the International Conference on Nonlinear Systems and Dynamics (CNSD-2013) held at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, December 12, 2013.

We first tested the method with a large dataset of known protein complexes obtaining an overall area under the ROC curve of 0.76 in the blind recognition of binding sites and then applied it to investigate the features of the interaction between the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human cellular receptors. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 uses a dual strategy: its spike protein could also interact with sialic acid receptors of the cells in the upper airways, in addition to the known interaction with Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edoardo Milanetti","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Mattia Miotto","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Di Rienzo","author_inst":"Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"},{"author_name":"Michele Monti","author_inst":"Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Gosti","author_inst":"Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Ruocco","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Adam Hage","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Colette Pietzsch","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Alexander Bukreyev","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rajsbaum","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Mark Bedford","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shelton Bradrick","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Mariano A Garcia-Blanco","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Cary Kendziora","author_inst":"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL 60510, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen H.

There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs. Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A quick way to test compounds with potential antiviral activity is through drug repurposing. Numerous drugs are already approved for human use and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to fast-track to clinical studies in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on the antiviral activity of 20 FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that also inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that 17 of these inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at a range of IC50 values at non-cytotoxic concentrations. We directly follow up with seven of these to demonstrate all are capable of inhibiting infectious SARS-CoV-2 production. Moreover, we have evaluated two of these, chloroquine and chlorpromazine, in vivo using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV model and found both drugs protect mice from clinical disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stuart Weston","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher M.

To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV. For this purpose, we compare the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae. We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maddalena Dilucca","author_inst":"La Sapienza, Roma"},{"author_name":"Athanasia Pavlopoulou","author_inst":"Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, 35340 Balcova, Izmir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sergio Forcelloni","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"ANDREA GIANSANTI","author_inst":"SAPIENZA UNIVERSITA DI ROMA"},{"author_name":"Alexandros G Georgakilas","author_inst":"National technical university of athens"},{"author_name":"Matthew Frieman","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam Hage","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Colette Pietzsch","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Alexander Bukreyev","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rajsbaum","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Mark Bedford","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shelton Bradrick","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Mariano A Garcia-Blanco","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Cary Kendziora","author_inst":"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL 60510, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen H.
