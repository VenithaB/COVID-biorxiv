The closely related polysaccharide heparin, the widely used anticoagulant drug, which is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy, can be expected to mimic the properties of HS. Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and inhibits cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2. We have previously demonstrated that unfractionated heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain, induces a conformational change and have reported the structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. Here we expand upon these studies, to a wide range of low molecular weight heparins and demonstrate that they induce a variety of conformational changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These findings may have further implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing low molecular weight heparins, as well as for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents, against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney Mycroft-West","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Yong Li","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Scott Guimond","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Timothy Rudd","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Stefano Elli","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

Like other coronaviruses, this novel virus relies on the surface Spike glycoprotein to access the host cells, mainly through the interaction of its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, molecular entities able to interfere with binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 have a great potential to inhibit viral entry. Starting from the available structural data on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor, we here engineered a mini-protein with the aim of creating a soluble and stable Spike interactor. This mini-protein, which was recombinantly produced in high yields, possesses a stable  helical conformation and is able to interact with the RBD of glycosylated Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar affinity, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. By plugging the Spike protein, our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Romano","author_inst":"Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, CNR"},{"author_name":"Alessia Ruggiero","author_inst":"Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, CNR"},{"author_name":"Flavia Squeglia","author_inst":"Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, CNR"},{"author_name":"Rita Berisio","author_inst":"CNR IBB"},{"author_name":"Timothy Rudd","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Stefano Elli","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

In this study, post-translational modification (PTM) of recombinant HCoV-19 S and hACE2 were characterized by LC-MSMS. We revealed that both proteins were highly decorated with specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes. Out of 21 possible glycosites in HCoV-19 S protein, 20 were confirmed completely occupied by N-glycans, with oligomannose glycans being the most abundant type. All 7 possible glycosylation sites in hACE2 were completely occupied mainly by complex type N-glycans. However, we showed that glycosylation did not directly contribute to the binding affinity between SARS-CoV spike protein and hACE2. Additionally, we also identified multiple sites methylated in both proteins, and multiple prolines in hACE2 were converted to hydroxylproline. Refined structural models were built by adding N-glycan and PTMs to recently published cryo-EM structure of the HCoV-19 S and hACE2 generated with glycosylation sites in the vicinity of binding surface. The PTM and glycan maps of both HCoV-19 S and hACE2 provide additional structural details to study mechanisms underlying host attachment, immune response mediated by S protein and hACE2, as well as knowledge to develop remedies and vaccines desperately needed nowadays.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zeyu Sun","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Keyi Ren","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Xing Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics & Center of Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jinghua Chen","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics & Center of Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Zhengyi Jiang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jing Jiang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Feiyang Ji","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Ouyang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Lanjuan Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Antonella Bisio","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

Comparison of genome sequences from diverse locations allows us to identify the genetic diversity among viruses which would help in ascertaining viral virulence, disease pathogenicity, origin and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 between countries. The aim of this study is to ascertain the genetic diversity among Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Initial examination of the phylogenetic data of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n=3123) from different continents deposited at GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) revealed multiple origin for Indian isolates. An in-depth analysis of 449 viral genomes derived from samples representing countries from USA, Europe, China, East Asia, South Asia, Oceania, Middle East regions and India revealed that most Indian samples are divided into two clusters (A and B) with cluster A showing more similarity to samples from Oceania and Kuwait and the cluster B grouping with countries from Europe, Middle East and South Asia. Diversity analysis of viral clades, which are characterized by specific non-synonymous mutations in viral proteins, discovered that the cluster A Indian samples belong to I clade (V378I in ORF1ab), which is an Oceania clade with samples having Iran connections and the cluster B Indian samples belong to G clade (D614G in Spike protein), which is an European clade. Thus our study identifies that the Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses belong to I and G clades with potential origin to be countries mainly from Oceania, Europe, Middle East and South Asia regions, which strongly implying the spread of virus through most travelled countries. The study also emphasizes the importance of pathogen genomics through phylogenetic analysis to discover viral genetic diversity and understand the viral transmission dynamics with eventual grasp on viral virulence and disease pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kumaravel Somasundaram","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Mainak Mondal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ankita Lawarde","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fakhry","author_inst":"Head and Neck Surgery Universitary Hospital of la Conception"},{"author_name":"Petros D Karkos","author_inst":"AHEPA University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shazia Peer","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Jon A Sistiaga-Suarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Jose A Gonzalez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Cammaroto","author_inst":"Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miguel Mayo","author_inst":"Hospital Complex of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Pablo Parente-Arias","author_inst":"Hospital Lucus Agusti"},{"author_name":"Sven Saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Tareck Ayad","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de l universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"David Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Lima","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Mark Skidmore","author_inst":"Keele University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079509","rel_title":"Pregnancy and breastfeeding during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review of published pregnancy cases","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079509","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging concern regarding the potential adverse effects during pregnancy. This study reviews knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed up to 8 April 2020, using PRISMA standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality. Results: We identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries. The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in 28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid, placenta, and\/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were negative. Four newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM antibodies. Breast milk samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: The evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still limited. Pregnant women and newborns should be considered particularly vulnerable populations regarding COVID-19 prevention and management strategies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carina Rodrigues","author_inst":"Instituto de Saude Publica da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Ines Baia","author_inst":"Instituto de Saude Publica da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Rosa Domingues","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas \/ Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Henrique Barros","author_inst":"Instituto de Saude Publica da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Petros D Karkos","author_inst":"AHEPA University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shazia Peer","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Jon A Sistiaga-Suarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Jose A Gonzalez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Cammaroto","author_inst":"Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miguel Mayo","author_inst":"Hospital Complex of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Pablo Parente-Arias","author_inst":"Hospital Lucus Agusti"},{"author_name":"Sven Saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Tareck Ayad","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de l universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"David Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Lima","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Mark Skidmore","author_inst":"Keele University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"obstetrics and gynecology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079079","rel_title":"Lopinavir-ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the treatment of 73 hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a pilot retrospective study","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079079","rel_abs":"Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of lopinavir\/ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the treatment of hospitalized patients with common coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).

Group-LR patients were treated with single antiviral drug of lopinavir-ritonavir. Group-LR+Ar patients were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol for antiviral therapy at least 3 days. Patients were assessed for different clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 34 and 39 patients were identified for Group-LR and Group-LR+Ar, respectively.

The emergence, detection, spread, treatment and containment of infectious diseases shows the considerable political and economic impacts in a highly interconnected world. We aimed to estimate the effects of socioeconomic levels on the spread and treatment of COVID-19 in China. Methods: We obtained daily COVID-19 cases at a city level in China. We used migration data from the major cities in Hubei Province, and macroeconomic data at city and province levels. We obtained social management measures in response to COVID-19 outbreak. We assessed the association between measures, migration and COVID-19 spread, and the association between socioeconomic levels and COVID-19 treatment capacity. Findings: On January 1, 2020, COVID-19 spread that affected by management measures and migration started across China. After Wuhan lockdown, the case number reached peak in 12 days, and COVID-19 outbreak was basically contained in China in four weeks due to intensive measures. Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces showed the most excellent COVID-19 treatment capacities. Socioeconomic levels in these provinces ranked top in China. Guangdong achieved the largest decline in severe case rate by 22.1%. Jiangsu had the lowest average rate of severe cases (1.7%) and zero death. Among the regions with top case number, Zhejiang showed the highest rate of cured cases on confirmed cases (96.3%), the lowest average rate of severe cases (7.7%), and one death. The COVID-19 treatment capacities were strongly affected by regional economics and measures on control, detection and treatment.

Methods: We reviewed and analyzed October 2019 GHS index co-leaders joint report, to review health security capacities on the basis of the GHS index in the context of six categories. we prioritized not only the capacities of 210 countries and territories around the world using the GHS Index, but also the existence of functional, tested, proven capabilities for stopping outbreaks at the source. Data were collected from global databases including Worldometer, WHO, and Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC). Findings: This study recruited data on 210 countries and territories, of which up to 14 April 2020, 72 countries (34.28%) with more than 1000 total COVID-19 cases were presents. In most prepared group, number of total COVID-19 diagnostic tests had a significant positive relation with GHS index (r=0.713; p=0.006).

Design: Community survey Setting: The COVID Symptom Tracker mobile application co-developed by physicians and scientists at Kings College London, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston and Zoe Global Limited was launched in the UK and US on 24th and 29th March 2020 respectively. It captured self-reported information related to COVID-19 symptoms and testing. Participants: 2,618,948 users of the COVID Symptom Tracker App. UK (95.7%) and US (4.3%) population. Data cut-off for this analysis was 21st April 2020. Main outcome measures: Visit to hospital and for those who attended hospital, the need for respiratory support in three subgroups (i) self-reported COVID-19 infection with classical symptoms (SR-COVID-19), (ii) self-reported positive COVID-19 test results (T-COVID-19), and (iii) imputed\/predicted COVID-19 infection based on symptomatology (I-COVID-19). Multivariate logistic regressions for each outcome and each subgroup were adjusted for age and gender, with sensitivity analyses adjusted for comorbidities. Classical symptoms were defined as high fever and persistent cough for several days. Results: Older age and all comorbidities tested were found to be associated with increased odds of requiring hospital care for COVID-19. Obesity (BMI >30) predicted hospital care in all models, with odds ratios (OR) varying from 1.20 [1.11; 1.31] to 1.40 [1.23; 1.60] across population groups. Pre-existing lung disease and diabetes were consistently found to be associated with hospital visit with a maximum OR of 1.79 [1.64,1.95] and 1.72 [1.27; 2.31]) respectively. Findings were similar when assessing the need for respiratory support, for which age and male gender played an additional role. Conclusions: Being older, obese, diabetic or suffering from pre-existing lung, heart or renal disease placed participants at increased risk of visiting hospital with COVID-19. It is of utmost importance for governments and the scientific and medical communities to work together to find evidence-based means of protecting those deemed most vulnerable from COVID-19.

Although more than 14,000 research articles on COVID-19 have been published with the disease taking a pandemic proportion, clinicians and researchers are struggling to distill knowledge for furthering clinical management and research. In this study, we address this gap for a targeted user group, i.e. clinicians, researchers, and policymakers by applying natural language processing to develop a CovidNLP dashboard in order to speed up knowledge discovery. The WHO has created a repository of about more than 5000 peer-reviewed and curated research articles on varied aspects including epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, social factors, and economics. We summarised all the articles in the WHO Database through an extractive summarizer followed by an exploration of the feature space using word embeddings which were then used to visualize the summarized associations of COVID-19 as found in the text. Clinicians, researchers, and policymakers will not only discover the direct effects of COVID-19 but also the systematic implications such as the anticipated rise in TB and cancer mortality due to the non-availability of drugs during the export lockdown as highlighted by our models. These demonstrate the utility of mining massive literature with natural language processing for rapid distillation and knowledge updates. This can help the users understand, synthesize, and take pre-emptive action with the available peer-reviewed evidence on COVID-19. Our models will be continuously updated with new literature and we have made our resource CovidNLP publicly available in a user-friendly fashion at http:\/\/covidnlp.tavlab.iiitd.edu.in\/.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raghav Awasthi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ridam Pal","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Singh","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aditya Nagori","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Suryatej Reddy","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Amogh Gulati","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"David Alden Drew","author_inst":"Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sajaysurya Ganesh","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited,164 Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7RW, UK"},{"author_name":"Julien Lavigne du Cadet","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited,164 Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7RW, UK"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Maxim B Freydin","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Marc Modat","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark S Graham","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila Pujol","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited,164 Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7RW, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Julia S El-Sayed Moustafa","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Davies","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited,164 Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7RW, UK"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Spector","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew T Chan","author_inst":"Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Claire J Steves","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20078311","rel_title":"Demographic and Socio-Economic Factors, and Healthcare Resource Indicators Associated with the Rapid Spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy: An Ecological Study","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20078311","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 rapidly escalated into a pandemic, threatening 213 countries, areas, and territories the world over. We aimed to identify potential province-level socioeconomic determinants of the virus's dissemination, and explain between-province differences in the speed of its spread, based on data from 36 provinces of Northern Italy. Methods: This is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints, assuming an exponential growth. Pearson's test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The virus's spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association between rate of spread and province-level indicators. Findings: Multivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively with aging index (p-value=0.003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-value=0.012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value=0.070), the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value=0.006). Interpretation: Demographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessandra Buja","author_inst":"Department of Cardiologic, Vascular and Thoracic Sciences, and Public Health, University of Padova.

However, the relationship of social capital to the spread of infectious disease like COVID-19 is lacking. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented threat to global health and economy, for which control strategies have relied on aggressive social distancing. However, an understanding of how social capital is related to changes in human mobility patterns for adherence to social distancing is lacking. Objective: This study examines the association between state- and county-level social capital indices and community health indices in the United States, and the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. It also examines changes in human mobility. Methods: Using publicly available state- and county-specific time series data for COVID-19 cases from March 13 to March 31, we used exponential fits to determine growth rate. We obtained publicly available mobility change data, originally measured from GPS-enabled mobile devices. The design was then state- and county-level correlation analysis with social capital and community health indices from the Social Capital Project (United States Senate). Results: In bivariate linear correlation analyses, we find social capital and community health indices were negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rates at both the state and county levels. The correlation was strongest at the county level for the community health index: a one-unit increase in the county community health index was associated with a decrease in the COVID-19 growth rate exponent by 0.045. In further bivariate correlation analyses, we find that social capital indices were negatively associated with retail\/recreation movement and positively associated with residential movement. That is, an increase in social capital is correlated with slower COVID-19 infection spread and more adherence to social distancing protocols. Conclusion: Our results indicate the potential benefit of incorporating social capital concepts in planning policies to control the spread of COVID-19, e.g. different social distancing requirements in different communities. The results also indicate a need for further research into this potentially causal relationship, including examining interventions to increase social capital, community health, and institutional health.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lav R.

We report the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical findings for confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first month of the epidemic in Brazil. Methods: Individual-level and aggregated COVID-19 data were analysed to investigate demographic profiles, socioeconomic drivers and age-sex structure of COVID-19 tested cases. Basic reproduction numbers (R0) were investigated for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify symptoms associated with confirmed cases and risk factors associated with hospitalization. Laboratory diagnosis for eight respiratory viruses were obtained for 2,429 cases. Findings: By March 25, 1,468 confirmed cases were notified in Brazil, of whom 10% (147 of 1,468) were hospitalised. Of the cases acquired locally (77.8%), two thirds (66.9% of 5,746) were confirmed in private laboratories. Overall, positive association between higher per capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. The median age of detected cases was 39 years (IQR 30-53). The median R0 was 2.9 for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Cardiovascular disease\/hypertension were associated with hospitalization. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B and human rhinovirus was detected in low levels. Interpretation: Socioeconomic disparity determines access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in Brazil. The lower median age of infection and hospitalization compared to other countries is expected due to a younger population structure. Enhanced surveillance of respiratory pathogens across socioeconomic statuses is essential to better understand and halt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William Marciel de Souza","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Lewis Fletcher Buss","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Darlan da Silva Candido","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jean Paul Carrera","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Li","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zarebski","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Maria Vincenti-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen"},{"author_name":"Janey Messina","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Flavia Cristina da Silva Sales","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Pamela dos Santos Andrade","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Prete Jr.","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Vitor Heloiz Nascimento","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fabio Ghilardi","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rafael Henrique Moraes Pereira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research"},{"author_name":"Andreza Aruska de Souza Santos","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Leandro Abade","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Gutierrez","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Moritz  U.

The Basic Reproduction Number (R_0) represents viral spread rate and can be dramatically modified by the application of effective public control measures. However, current methodologies to calculate R_0 from data remain cumbersome and unusable during an outbreak. Objective: To provide a simple mathematical formulation for obtaining R_0 in Real-Time, and apply it to assess the effectiveness of public-health policies in different iconic countries. Study design: By modifying the equations describing the spread of the virus, we derived a real-time $R_0$ estimator that can be readily calculated from daily official case reports. Results: We show the application of a time trend analysis of the R_0 estimator to assess the efficacy and promptness of public health measures that impacted on the development of the COVID-19 epidemic in iconic countries. Conclusions: We propose our simple estimator and method as useful tools to follow and assess in real time the effectiveness of public health policies on COVID-19 evolution.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastian Contreras","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"H.

Hypertension is the most common pre-existing condition amongst COVID-19 patients. Upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is common in hypertensive patients and may promote inflammation and ensuing cytokine storm in COVID-19. It is unknown whether RAAS inhibition with ACE1 inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) can be harmful or beneficial. Methods: Within Hackensack Meridian Health network, the largest healthcare provider in New Jersey, we performed a retrospective, multicenter, convenience sampling study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were manually abstracted. Fishers exact tests, and logistic regression were performed. Results: Among 3017 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 1584 (52.5%) carried a diagnosis of hypertension. In the discharged or deceased cohort, the overall mortality was significantly increased at 35% vs 13% among COVID-19 patients with hypertension. However, when adjusted for age, the effect of hypertension on mortality was greatly diminished, with a reduction in odds-ratio by over half; and completely disappeared when adjusted for other major covariates. The mortality rates were lower for hypertensive patients prescribed ACE1 (27%, p=0.001) or ARBs (33%, p=0.12) compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (39%) in the unadjusted analyses. RAAS inhibitor therapy appeared protective compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (p=0.001). Conclusions: While our results are limited by the retrospective nature of our study and by potential confounders, our data argue against a harmful effect of RAAS inhibition and support the HFSA\/AHA\/ACC joint statement recommending continuing ACE1 and ARB therapy in hypertensive COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Ip","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kaushal Parikh","author_inst":"Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Joseph E Parrillo","author_inst":"Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shivam Mathura","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Eric Hansen","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Ihor S Sawczuk","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Vidhya Appu","author_inst":"Shop101"},{"author_name":"Raunak Ramakrishnan","author_inst":"Shop101"},{"author_name":"Shashank Ch","author_inst":"Shop101"},{"author_name":"Mohit Jindal","author_inst":"Shop101"},{"author_name":"Vadhir Bhupathi","author_inst":"Shop101"},{"author_name":"Aditya Gupta","author_inst":"Shop101"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Jain","author_inst":"Shop101"},{"author_name":"Rishi Agarwal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Shreya Pathak","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Ali Rehan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Sarthak Consul","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Yash Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Nimay Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Pratyush Agarwal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Ritika Goyal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Vinay Sagar","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Uma Ramakrishnan","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Krishna","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Peng Yin","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, and Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Dasaradhi Palakodeti","author_inst":"InStem Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Manoj Gopalkrishnan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Ganem","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude do Brasil"},{"author_name":"Walquiria Ferreira Almeida","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude do Brasil"},{"author_name":"Francieli Fontana Sutile Tardetti Fantinato","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude do Brasil"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Marques Macario","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude do Brasil"},{"author_name":"Wanderson Kleber Oliveira","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude do Brasil"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pybus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chieh-Hsi Wu","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Julio Croda","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Ester Cerdeira Sabino","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Nuno R.

We aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of all confirmed cases in Qinghai, a province at high altitude. With efficient measures to stop the spread of coronavirus, no new cases were found in Qinghai Province for 60 consecutive days between Feb 6 and April 6, 2020. Of all 18 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 15 patients comprising 4 transmission clusters were identified. Three patients were infected by direct contact without travel history to Wuhan. Seven patients were asymptomatic on admission. Of 18 patients, 10 patients showed bilateral pneumonia and 2 patients showed no abnormalities. Three patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, liver diseases or diabetes developed severe illness. High C-reactive protein levels and elevations of both ALT and AST were observed in 3 severely ill patients on admission. All 18 patients were eventually discharged, including the 3 severe patients who recovered after treatment with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma and other therapies. Our findings confirmed human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clusters. The strategies of early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment are important to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and improve the cure rate. Patients with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe illness and could benefit from convalescent plasma transfusion.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"AIqi Xi","author_inst":"The Fourth People Hospital of Qinghai Province"},{"author_name":"Zhuo Ma","author_inst":"The Fourth People Hospital of Qinghai Province"},{"author_name":"Jingtao Dai","author_inst":"The Fourth People Hospital of Qinghai Province"},{"author_name":"Yuehe Ding","author_inst":"The Fourth People Hospital of Qinghai Province"},{"author_name":"Xiuzhen Ma","author_inst":"The Fourth People Hospital of Qinghai Province"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Ma","author_inst":"The Fourth People Hospital of Qinghai Province"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyi Wang","author_inst":"The Fourth People Hospital of Qinghai Province"},{"author_name":"Lianmeng Shi","author_inst":"The Third People Hospital of Xining"},{"author_name":"Huanying Bai","author_inst":"The Third People Hospital of Xining"},{"author_name":"Hongying Zheng","author_inst":"The Third People Hospital of Xining"},{"author_name":"Eric Nuermberger","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University; The Fourth People Hospital of Qinghai Province"},{"author_name":"Aditya Gupta","author_inst":"Shop101"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Jain","author_inst":"Shop101"},{"author_name":"Rishi Agarwal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Shreya Pathak","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Ali Rehan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Sarthak Consul","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Yash Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Nimay Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Pratyush Agarwal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Ritika Goyal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Vinay Sagar","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Uma Ramakrishnan","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Krishna","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Peng Yin","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, and Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Dasaradhi Palakodeti","author_inst":"InStem Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Manoj Gopalkrishnan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Ganem","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude do Brasil"},{"author_name":"Walquiria Ferreira Almeida","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude do Brasil"},{"author_name":"Francieli Fontana Sutile Tardetti Fantinato","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude do Brasil"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Marques Macario","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude do Brasil"},{"author_name":"Wanderson Kleber Oliveira","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude do Brasil"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pybus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chieh-Hsi Wu","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Julio Croda","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Ester Cerdeira Sabino","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Nuno R.

We summarized and compared the guidelines published by national and international societies\/organizations on facemasks and respirators to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare settings. Methods From the 1st January to the 2nd April 2020, guidelines published in four countries (France, Germany, United States, United Kingdom), and two international organizations (US and European Center for Diseases Control, and World Health Organization) were reviewed to analyze the mask and respirators recommended as PPE for the care of patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Guidelines were eligible for analysis if they (1) included specific guidelines, (2) were written for HCP protection, (3) targeting healthcare settings. The strategy recommended for optimizing supplies and overcoming shortages was collected. Observations The guidelines publication process on respiratory protections varied greatly across countries. Some referred to a unique guide whereas others saw the issue of multiple recommendations by various societies and organization. In term of chronology, most guidelines were published in March with either downgraded (US and European CDC), relatively stable (WHO, Germany, and UK), or a mixing of high and low level equipment (France). The recommendation of respirators was universally recommended for aerosol generating procedures (AGP) across countries, although the type of respirators and what constituted an AGP was variable. Some guidance maintained the use of N95\/99 for all contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases (i.e. Germany) whereas others, recommended a surgical mask (i.e. WHO, UK, France). The strategies to overcome shortage of respiratory protection equipment were based on minimizing the need and rationalizing the use, but also prolonging their use, reusing them after cleaning\/sterilization, or using cloth masks. Conclusions Stable and consistent guidelines inside and across countries, clearly detailing the respiratory protection type, and the circumstances in which they need to be used may prevent the confusion among frontline staff, and avoid shortage.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriel Birgand","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nico T.

Their appropriate use and interpretation require accurate assay performance data. Method We conducted an evaluation of 10 lateral flow assays (LFAs) and two ELISAs to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The specimen set comprised 128 plasma or serum samples from 79 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals; 108 pre-COVID-19 negative controls; and 52 recent samples from individuals who underwent respiratory viral testing but were not diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Samples were blinded and LFA results were interpreted by two independent readers, using a standardized intensity scoring system. Results Among specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals, the percent seropositive increased with time interval, peaking at 81.8-100.0% in samples taken >20 days after symptom onset. Test specificity ranged from 84.3-100.0% in pre-COVID-19 specimens. Specificity was higher when weak LFA bands were considered negative, but this decreased sensitivity. IgM detection was more variable than IgG, and detection was highest when IgM and IgG results were combined. Agreement between ELISAs and LFAs ranged from 75.7-94.8%. No consistent cross-reactivity was observed. Conclusion Our evaluation showed heterogeneous assay performance. Reader training is key to reliable LFA performance, and can be tailored for survey goals. Informed use of serology will require evaluations covering the full spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infections, from asymptomatic and mild infection to severe disease, and later convalescence. Well-designed studies to elucidate the mechanisms and serological correlates of protective immunity will be crucial to guide rational clinical and public health policies.","rel_num_authors":72,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

We performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and tried to describe the liver damage. Methods: We searched PubMed, google scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 18, 2020 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Meta-Analyses. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the severity of COVID-19 using a fixed or random effects model. Results: In a meta-analysis of 37 studies, comprising 6,235 patients, the pooled mean of ALT was 36.4 IU\/L in the severe cases of COVID-19 while 27.8 IU\/L in the non-severe cases (95% CI: -9.4- -5.1, p<0.0001). Pooled average of AST was 46.8 IU\/L in the severe cases while 30.4 IU\/L in the non-severe cases (95% CI: -15.1- -10.4, p<0.0001). Compared with the non-severe cases, the severe cases tended to have higher {gamma}-Glutamyltransferase while lower albumin. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we comprehensively described three patterns of liver impairment related to COVID-19, including hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and synthetic disfunction, according to the severity of the COVID-19. Patients with abnormal liver tests are at higher risks of progressing to severe disease. Close monitoring on liver chemistries helps to early warn against disease progression.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuan Dong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Dan-Yi Zeng","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yan-Yan Cai","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei-Ming Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qing-Qing Xing","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yan-Dan Ren","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Zhu Hong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Shui Pan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Whitty","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M Woo","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Antonia E.

In this report a new intelligent model called HH-COVID-19 is proposed, with simple design and adaptive parameters. Methods: The parameters R_0 and S_I are adapted by adding three new weighting factors , {beta} and {gamma} and two free parameters {sigma}_1 and {sigma}_2 in function of time t, thus the HH-COVID-19 become time-variant model. The parameters R_0, S_I, , {beta}, {gamma}, {sigma}_1 and {sigma}_2 are estimated optimally based on a recent algorithm of artificial intelligence (AI), inspired from nature called Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO), using the data of the confirmed infected cases in Algeria country in the first t=55 days. Results: Parameters estimated optimally: R_0= 1.341, S_I= 5.991, = 2.987, {beta}= 1.566, {gamma}= 4.998 {sigma}_1= -0.133 and {sigma}_2= 0.0324. R_0 starts on 1.341 and ends to 2.677, and S_I starts on 5.991 and ends to 6.692. The estimated results are identically to the actual infected incidence in Algeria, HH-COVID-19 proved its superiority in comparison study. HH-COVID-19 predicts that in 1 May, the infected cases exceed 50 000, during May, to reach quickly the herd immunity stage at beginning of July. Conclusion: HH-COVID-19 can be used for tracking any COVID-19 outbreak cases around the world, just should updating its new parameters to fitting the area to be studied, especially when the population is directly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bachir Nail","author_inst":"Tissemsilt University Center"},{"author_name":"Abdelaziz Rabehi","author_inst":"Tissemsilt University Center"},{"author_name":"Belkacem Bekhiti","author_inst":"Blida University"},{"author_name":"Taha Arbaoui","author_inst":"University of Technology Troyes"},{"author_name":"Qing-Qing Xing","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yan-Dan Ren","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Zhu Hong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Shui Pan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Whitty","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M Woo","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Antonia E.

The pattern of outbreaks for COVID-19 across the globe have differed markedly above and below 30{degrees}N latitudes, suggesting very different levels of severity, but countries worldwide have implemented the same lockdown strategies. Existing methods for estimating severity appear not to have been useful in informing strategic decisions, possibly due to mismatches between the data required and those available, overly sophisticated methods with undesirable biases, or perhaps confusion and uncertainly generated by the wide range of estimates these methods produced early on. The Epidemic Severity Index (ESI) is a simple, robust method for estimating the local severity of novel epidemic outbreaks using early and widely-available data and that does not depend on any estimated values. ESI allows rapid, meaningful comparisons across territories that can be tracked as the outbreaks unfold. The ESI quantifies severity relative to a parameterised baseline rather than attempting to estimate values for infection fatality rates, case fatality rates or transmission rates. The relative nature of the ESI sidesteps any problems of confidence associated with absolute rate estimation methods and offers immediate practical strategic value.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gareth Davies","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Abdelaziz Rabehi","author_inst":"Tissemsilt University Center"},{"author_name":"Belkacem Bekhiti","author_inst":"Blida University"},{"author_name":"Taha Arbaoui","author_inst":"University of Technology Troyes"},{"author_name":"Qing-Qing Xing","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yan-Dan Ren","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Zhu Hong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Shui Pan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Whitty","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M Woo","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Antonia E.
