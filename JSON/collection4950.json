The role of children and young people in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns and behaviour. Objective We undertook a rapid systematic review to address the question What is the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and adolescents compared with adults? Data sources We searched PubMed and medRxiv up to 28 July 2020 and identified 13,926 studies, with additional studies identified through handsearching of cited references and professional contacts. Study Selection We included studies which provided data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and young people ( <20 years) compared with adults derived from contact-tracing or population-screening. We excluded single household studies. Data extraction and Synthesis We followed PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data, independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies. Random effects meta-analysis was undertaken. Main Outcomes Secondary infection rate (contact-tracing studies) or prevalence or seroprevalence (population-screening studies) amongst children and young people compared with adults. Results 32 studies met inclusion criteria; 18 contact-tracing and 14 population-screening. The pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults was 0.56 (0.37, 0.85) with substantial heterogeneity (95%). Three school contact tracing studies found minimal transmission by child or teacher index cases. Findings from population-screening studies were heterogenous and were not suitable for meta-analysis. The majority of studies were consistent with lower seroprevalence in children compared with adults, although seroprevalence in adolescents appeared similar to adults. Conclusions There is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with a 43% lower odds of being an infected contact. There is weak evidence that children and young people play a lesser role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Russell M Viner","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond St. Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Oliver T Mytton","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Chris Bonell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"G.J.

Although the genetic sequences of their etiologic viruses are of high homology, the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 significantly differ from SARS5,6. Especially, it seems that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes vast replication in vivo without being effectively monitored by anti-viral immunity7. Here, we show that the viral protein encoded from open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all the viral proteins, can directly interact with MHC-I molecules and significantly down-regulates their surface expression on various cell types. In contrast, ORF8a and ORF8b of SARS-CoV do not exert this function. In the ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-I molecules are selectively target for lysosomal degradation by an autophagy-dependent mechanism. As a result, CTLs inefficiently eliminate the ORF8-expressing cells. Our results demonstrate that ORF8 protein disrupts antigen presentation and reduces the recognition and the elimination of virus-infected cells by CTLs8. Therefore, we suggest that the inhibition of ORF8 function could be a strategy to improve the special immune surveillance and accelerate the eradication of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yiwen Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yingshi Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Baohong Luo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yaochang Yuan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Feng Huang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Women and Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tao Yang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Yu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Bingfeng Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Song","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingliang Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Pan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhuang Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Rong Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.113175","rel_title":"Structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induced by ACE2","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.113175","rel_abs":"MotivationThe recent emergence of the novel SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its international spread pose a global health emergency. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein binds the receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) ACE2 and promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. The trimeric S protein binds the receptor using the distal receptor-binding domain (RBD) causing conformational changes in S protein that allow priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling the dynamic structural features used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal novel therapeutic targets. Using structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, we performed structural analysis and atomic comparisons of the different conformational states adopted by the SARS-CoV-2-RBD.\n\nResultsHere, we determined the key structural components induced by the receptor and characterized their intramolecular interactions. We show that {kappa}-helix (also known as polyproline II) is a predominant structure in the binding interface and in facilitating the conversion to the active form of the S protein. We demonstrate a series of conversions between switch-like {kappa}-helix and {beta}-strand, and conformational variations in a set of short -helices which affect the proximal hinge region. This conformational changes lead to an alternating pattern in conserved disulfide bond configurations positioned at the hinge, indicating a possible disulfide exchange, an important allosteric switch implicated in viral entry of various viruses, including HIV and murine coronavirus. The structural information presented herein enables us to inspect and understand the important dynamic features of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and propose a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block viral entry. Overall, this study provides guidance for the design and optimization of structure-based intervention strategies that target SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tomer Meirson","author_inst":"Bar Ilan University"},{"author_name":"David Bomze","author_inst":"Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gal Markel","author_inst":"Ella Lemelbaum Institute for Immuno-oncology, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan 526260, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yaochang Yuan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Feng Huang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Women and Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tao Yang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Yu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Bingfeng Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Song","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingliang Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Pan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhuang Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Rong Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.104919","rel_title":"In silico Proteome analysis of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.104919","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2019-nCoV), is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus. The virus is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is contagious through human-to-human transmission. The present study reports sequence analysis, complete coordinate tertiary structure prediction and in silico sequence-based and structure-based functional characterization of full SARS-CoV-2 proteome based on the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512 (29903 bp ss-RNA) which is identical to GenBank entry MN908947 and MT415321. The proteome includes 12 major proteins namely orf1ab polyprotein (includes 15 proteins), surface glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6 protein, ORF7a protein, orf7b, ORF8, Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and ORF10 protein. Each protein of orf1ab polyprotein group has been studied separately. A total of 25 polypeptides have been analyzed out of which 15 proteins are not yet having experimental structures and only 10 are having experimental structures with known PDB IDs. Out of 15 newly predicted structures six (6) were predicted using comparative modeling and nine (09) proteins having no significant similarity with so far available PDB structures were modeled using ab-initio modeling. Structure verification using recent tools QMEANDisCo 4.0.0 and ProQ3 for global and local (per-residue) quality estimates indicate that the all-atom model of tertiary structure of high quality and may be useful for structure-based drug designing targets. The study has identified nine major targets (spike protein, envelop protein, membrane protein, nucleocapsid protein, 2-O-ribose methyltransferase, endoRNAse, 3-to-5 exonuclease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase) for which drug design targets could be considered. There are other 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which may also be percieved from the drug design angle. The protein structures have been deposited to ModelArchive. Tunnel analysis revealed the presence of large number of tunnels in NSP3, ORF 6 protein and membrane glycoprotein indicating a large number of transport pathways for small ligands influencing their reactivity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chittaranjan Baruah","author_inst":"Post Graduate Department of Zoology, Darrang College, Tezpur-784001, Assam, India"},{"author_name":"Papari Devi","author_inst":"TCRP Foundation Guwahati-781005, Assam, India"},{"author_name":"Dhirendra K Sharma","author_inst":"School of Biological Science, University of Science & Technology, Meghalaya-793101, India"},{"author_name":"Yaochang Yuan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Feng Huang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Women and Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tao Yang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Yu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Bingfeng Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Song","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingliang Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Pan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhuang Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Rong Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110809","rel_title":"Succumbing to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Healthcare Workers not Satisfied and Intend to Leave Their Jobs","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110809","rel_abs":"Background: Healthcare workers are under such a tremendous amount of pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic that many have become concerned about their jobs and even intend to leave them.

As COVID-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths. Methods: Using an online platform, we surveyed the U.S. adult population in May 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. These factors were compared across basic demographics. Findings: Of the 672 participants surveyed, 450 (67%) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended for them. Males (72%), older adults ([&ge;]55 years; 78%), Asians (81%), and college and\/or graduate degree holders (75%) were more likely to accept the vaccine. When comparing reported influenza vaccine uptake to reported acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine: 1) participants who did not complete high school had a very low influenza vaccine uptake (10%), while 60% of the same group said they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine; 2) unemployed participants reported lower influenza uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance when compared to those employed or retired; and, 3) black Americans reported lower influenza vaccine uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than nearly all other racial groups. Lastly, we identified geographic differences with Department of Health and Human Services regions 2 (New York) and 5 (Chicago) reporting less than 50 percent COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Interpretation: Although our study found a 67% acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, there were noticeable demographic and geographical disparities in vaccine acceptance. Before a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced to the U.S., public health officials and policymakers must prioritize effective COVID-19 vaccine-acceptance messaging for all Americans, especially those who are most vulnerable.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amyn A.

The response to a pandemic requires both resilience and imagination. It has been clearly documented that obtaining an accurate estimate and trends of the actual infection rate and mortality risk are very important for policy makers and medical professionals. One cannot estimate mortality rates without an accurate assessment of the number of infected individuals in the population. This need is also aligned with identifying the infected individuals so they can be properly treated, monitored and tracked. However, accurate estimation of the infection rate, locally, geographically and nationally is important independently. These infection rate estimates can guide policy makers at both state, national or world level to achieve a better management of risk to society. The decisions facing policy makers are very different during early stages of an emerging epidemic where the infection rate is low, middle stages where the rate is rapidly climbing, and later stages where the epidemic curve has flattened to a low and relatively sustainable rate. In this paper we provide relatively efficient pooling methods to both estimate infection rates and identify infected individuals for populations with low infection rates. These estimates may provide significant cost reductions for testing in rural communities, third world countries and other situations where the cost of testing is expensive or testing is not widely available. As we prepare for the second wave of the pandemic this line of work may provide new solutions for both the biomedical community and policy makers at all levels.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Beigel","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Simon Kasif","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Mcloughlin","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Imran Mannan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Arshad Rather","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul Knopp","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Daniel Davis","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Saleh H Almurashi","author_inst":"Medical student, Faculty of Medicine, Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Bingfeng Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Song","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingliang Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Pan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhuang Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Rong Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110502","rel_title":"Conditions for a second wave of COVID-19 due to interactions between disease dynamics and social processes","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110502","rel_abs":"In May 2020, many jurisdictions around the world began lifting physical distancing restrictions against the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), giving rise to concerns about a possible second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These restrictions were imposed as a collective population response to the presence of COVID-19 in communities. However, lifting restrictions is also a population response to their socio-economic impacts, and is expected to increase COVID-19 cases, in turn. This suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies a coupled behaviour-disease system. Here we develop a minimal mathematical model of the interaction between social support for school and workplace closure and the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We find that a second wave of COVID-19 occurs across a broad range of plausible model input parameters, on account of instabilities generated by behaviour-disease interactions. We conclude that second waves of COVID-19--should they materialize--can be interpreted as the outcomes of nonlinear interactions between disease dynamics and population behaviour.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sansao A Pedro","author_inst":"Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, Departamento de Matematica e Informatica, Maputo, Mozambique"},{"author_name":"Frank T Ndjomatchoua","author_inst":"International Rice Research Institute, Sustainable Impact Platform, Geospatial Science and Modelling cluster, DAPO Box 7777-1301, Metro Manila, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Peter Jentsch","author_inst":"University of Guelph, School of Environmental Sciences, Guelph, N1G 2W1, Canada and University of Waterloo, Department of Applied Mathematics, Waterloo, N2L 3G1"},{"author_name":"Jean M Tcheunche","author_inst":"Avenir Health, Glastonbury, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Madhur Anand","author_inst":"University of Guelph, School of Environmental Sciences, Guelph, N1G 2W1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Chris T Bauch","author_inst":"University of Waterloo, Department of Applied Mathematics, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Daniel Davis","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Saleh H Almurashi","author_inst":"Medical student, Faculty of Medicine, Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Bingfeng Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Song","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingliang Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Pan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhuang Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Rong Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110551","rel_title":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are associated with reduced viral load","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110551","rel_abs":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been described, but correlation with virologic outcomes is limited.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haoyang Sun","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Borame Lee Dickens","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Alex Richard Cook","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Hannah Eleanor Clapham","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Anu Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Wener","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chihiro Morishima","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Keith Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander L Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jingliang Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Pan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhuang Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Rong Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110791","rel_title":"Ethnics and economics in COVID-19: Meta-regression of data from countries in the New York metropolitan area","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110791","rel_abs":"Ethnics and economics may affect prevalence and case fatality of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To determine whether COVID-19 prevalence and fatality are modulated by ethnics and economics, meta-regression of data from the countries in the New York metropolitan area were herein conducted. We selected 31 countries in the New York metropolitan area. 1) Prevalence and case-fatality rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 20, 2020 and 2) income and poverty estimates were obtained in each country. We performed random-effects meta-regression using OpenMetaAnalys. The covariates included 1) black (%), 2) Hispanic or Latino (%), 3) poverty rates (%), and 4) median household income ($). Statistically significant (P < .05) covariates in the univariable model were together entered into the multivariable model. A slope (coefficient) of the univariable meta-regression line for COVID-19 prevalence was not significant for household income (P = .639), whereas the coefficient was significantly positive for black (coefficient, 0.021; P = .015), Hispanic\/Latino (0.033; P < .001), and poverty (0.039; P = .02), which indicated that COVID-19 prevalence increased significantly as black, Hispanic\/Latino, and poverty increased. The multivariable model revealed that the slope was significantly positive for only Hispanic\/Latino (P < .001). The coefficient in the univariable model for COVID-19 fatality, however, was not significant for all the covariate. In conclusion, black, Hispanic\/Latino, and poverty (not household income), especially Hispanic\/Latino independently, may be associated with COVID-19 prevalence. There may be no association of black, Hispanic\/Latino, poverty, and household income with COVID-19 fatality.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hisato Takagi","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Toshiki Kuno","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yujiro Yokoyama","author_inst":"Easton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hiroki Ueyama","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Takuya Matsushiro","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yosuke Hari","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tomo Ando","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital\/Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Keith Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander L Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jingliang Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Pan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhuang Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Rong Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20110882","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 lethality decreased over time in two Italian Provinces","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20110882","rel_abs":"Background Some experts recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 lethality decreased considerably, but no evidence is yet available.

Methods: This web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among students of four Pakistani higher education institutions. Google forms were used to disseminate the online questionnaire to assess anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), sources of distress (14-items) and the coping strategies (Brief-COPE). Results: A total of 1134 responses (age 21.7 {+\/-} 3.5 years) were included. The frequency of students having moderate-severe anxiety and depression (score [&ge;] 10) were {approx} 34% and 45%, respectively. The respondents' aged [&ge;] 31 years had significantly lower depression score than those below 30 years. Males had significantly less anxiety and depression scores than females. Additionally, those having a family member, friend or acquaintance infected with the disease had significantly higher anxiety score. The main sources of distress were the changes in daily life due to the ongoing pandemic. Regarding coping strategies, majority of respondents were found to have adopted religious\/spiritual coping (6.45 {+\/-} 1.68) followed by acceptance (5.58 {+\/-} 1.65).

We want to assess the role of targeted synthetic or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (ts\/bDMARDs) and other variables in the development of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease in IRD. Methods: An observational longitudinal study was conducted (1stMar to 15thApr 2020). All patients from the rheumatology outpatient clinic from a hospital in Madrid with a medical diagnosis of IRD were included. Main outcome: hospital admission related to COVID-19. Independent variable: ts\/bDMARDs. Covariates: sociodemographic, comorbidities, type of IRD diagnosis, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Incidence rate (IR) of hospital admission related to COVID-19, was expressed per 1,000 patients-month. Cox multivariate regression analysis was run to examine the influence of ts\/bDMARDs and other covariates on IR. Results: 3,591 IRD patients were included (5,896 patients-month). Concerning csDMARDs, methotrexate was the most used followed by antimalarials. 802 patients were on ts\/bDMARDs, mainly anti-TNF agents, and rituximab. Hospital admissions related to COVID-19 occurred in 54 patients (1.36%) with an IR of 9.15 [95%CI: 7-11.9]. In the multivariate analysis, older, male gender, presence of comorbidities and specific systemic autoimmune conditions (Sjoegren, polychondritis, Raynaud and mixed connective tissue disease) had more risk of hospital admissions regardless other factors. Exposition to ts\/bDMARDs did not achieve statistical signification. Use of glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, and csDMARDs dropped from the final model. Conclusion: This study provides additional evidence in IRD patients regarding susceptibility to moderate-severe infection related to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos"},{"author_name":"Leticia Leon","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos.

We aimed to develop and validate a novel reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in both qualified laboratories and point-of-care settings. Methods Patients with suspected COVID-19 and close contacts between Jan 26 and April 8, 2020, were recruited from two hospitals. Respiratory samples were collected and tested with LAMP and the results were compared with those obtained by RT-qPCR. The inconsistent samples between these two methods were subjected to next-generation sequencing for confirmation. In addition, we tested the RT-LAMP on an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier and patients with other respiratory viral infections. Results We finally collected a cohort of 129 cases (329 nasopharyngeal swabs) and the independent cohort of 76 patients (152 nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples). RT-LAMP was validated to be accurate (overall sensitivity and specificity: 88.89% and 99.00%; positive and negative predictive values: 94.74% and 97.78%) and diagnostically useful (positive and negative likelihood ratios: 88.89 and 0.11). RT-LAMP showed an increased sensitivity (88.89% vs 81.48%) and high consistency (kappa 0.92) compared with RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 screening while requiring only constant temperature heating and visual inspection. The median time required for RT-LAMP was less than 1 h from sample to result. Further analyses indicated that RT-LAMP was feasible for asymptomatic patients and did not cross-react with other respiratory pathogen infections. Conclusion The RT-LAMP assay offers a rapid, sensitive and straightforward detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could aid the expansion of COVID-19 testing in the public domain and hospitals.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuejiao Hu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qianyun Deng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Junmin Li","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jierong Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zixia Wang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiqin Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Fang","author_inst":"Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haijian Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yunhu Zhao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Pan Yu","author_inst":"Genskey Biotechnology Co.

ARBs and\/or ACEi treatments, and hypertension, diabetes, cancer, COPD, renal and major cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were extracted from clinical charts and electronic health records, up to two years before infection. The sample consisted of 1603 subjects (mean age 58.0y; 47.3% males): 454 (28.3%) had severe symptoms, 192 (12.0%) very severe or lethal disease (154 deaths; mean age 79.3 years; 70.8% hypertensive, 42.2% with CVD). The youngest deceased person aged 44 years. Among hypertensive subjects (n=543), the proportion of those treated with ARBs or ACEi were 88.4%, 78.7% and 80.6% among patients with mild, severe and very severe\/lethal disease, respectively. At multivariate analysis, no association was observed between therapy and disease severity (Adjusted OR for very severe\/lethal COVID-19: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.50-1.49). Significant predictors of severe disease were older age (with AORs largely increasing after 70 years of age), male gender (AOR: 1.76; 1.40-2.23), diabetes (AOR: 1.52; 1.05-2.18), CVD (AOR: 1.88; 1.32-2.70) and COPD (1.88; 1.11-3.20). Only gender, age and diabetes also predicted very severe\/lethal disease. Conclusion: No association was found between COVID-19 severity and treatment with ARBs and\/or ACEi, supporting the recommendation to continue medication for all patients unless otherwise advised by their physicians.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Bravi","author_inst":"\"Sant'Anna\" University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Elena Flacco","author_inst":"Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tiziano Carradori","author_inst":"\"Sant'Anna\" University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlo Alberto Volta","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Cosenza","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Aldo De Togni","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Acuti Martellucci","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, University of the Marche Region, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giustino Parruti","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Pescara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mantovani","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Surgery, University Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Wenmin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Wang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shan Li","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tieying Hou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108860","rel_title":"Immunity after COVID-19: protection or sensitization ?","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108860","rel_abs":"Motivated by historical and present clinical observations, we discuss the possible unfavorable evolution of the immunity (similar to documented antibody-dependent enhancement scenarios) after a first infection with COVID-19.

The disease has spread very swiftly worldwide. A timely clue which includes the estimation of the incubation period among COVID-19 patients can allow governments and healthcare authorities to act accordingly. Objectives: to undertake a review and critical appraisal of all published\/preprint reports that offer an estimation of incubation periods for COVID-19. Eligibility criteria: This research looked for all relevant published articles between the dates of December 1, 2019, and April 25, 2020, i.e. those that were related to the COVID-19 incubation period. Papers were included if they were written in English, and involved human participants. Papers were excluded if they were not original (e.g. reviews, editorials, letters, commentaries, or duplications). Sources of evidence: COVID-19 Open Research Dataset supplied by Georgetown's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology as well as PubMed and Embase via Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Charting methods: A data-charting form was jointly developed by the two reviewers (NZ and EA), to determine which variables to extract. The two reviewers independently charted the data, discussed the results, and updated the data-charting form. Results and conclusions: screening was undertaken 44,000 articles with a final selection of 25 studies referring to 18 different experimental projects related to the estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19. The majority of extant published estimates offer empirical evidence showing that the incubation period for the virus is a mean of 7.8 days, with a median of 5.01 days, which falls into the ranges proposed by the WHO (0 to 14 days) and the ECDC (2 to 12 days). Nevertheless, a number of authors proposed that quarantine time should be a minimum of 14 days and that for estimates of mortality risks a median time delay of 13 days between illness and mortality should be under consideration. It is unclear as to whether any correlation exists between the age of patients and the length of time they incubate the virus.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nazar Zaki","author_inst":"UAEU, UAE"},{"author_name":"Elfadil Abdalla Mohamed","author_inst":"Ajman University, UAE"},{"author_name":"Tiziano Carradori","author_inst":"\"Sant'Anna\" University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlo Alberto Volta","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Cosenza","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Aldo De Togni","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Acuti Martellucci","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, University of the Marche Region, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giustino Parruti","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Pescara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mantovani","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Surgery, University Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Wenmin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Wang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shan Li","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tieying Hou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108605","rel_title":"Spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108605","rel_abs":"Background The spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have been mainly described in form of case series or retrospective studies. In this study, we aimed to provide a coherent overview from published studies of the duration of viral detection and viral load in COVID-19 patients, stratified by specimen type, clinical severity and age. Method We systematically searched PubMed\/MEDLINE and Cochrane review database for studies published between 1. November 2019 and 23rd of April 2020. We included studies that reported individual viral data over time measuring negative conversion by two consecutive negative tests, individual clinical severity and age. We excluded studies that reported viral data as patient fraction, reported only baseline data, included solely asymptomatic patients or were interventional studies. Extracted data included author, title, design, sample size, thresholds and genes of RT-PCR, patient age, COVID-19 severity, clinical characteristics, treatment, location of viral sampling, duration of viral detection, and viral load. We pooled the data of selected studies to determine effect estimates of duration of viral detection. Combined viral load was visualized over time. Findings Out of 7226 titles screened, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative analysis and 22 studies in the quantitative analysis comprising 650 COVID-19 patients. The pooled estimate of the duration of positive detection of the virus was in mild adult patients 12.1 days (CI: 10.12, 14.05) after symptom onset in the upper respiratory tract (URT), 24.1 days (CI: 10.02, 38.19) in lower respiratory tract (LRT), and 15.5 days (CI: 8.04, 22.88) in faeces. Further, in mild adult patients, the maximum viral load was ~ 6.61 x 108 viral copies\/mL in the URT and ~ 2.69 x 108 viral copies\/mL in the LRT, within the first week of symptom onset. The maximum viral load in faeces was reported as ~ 3.55 x 107 copies\/mL on Day 9. In moderate-severe adult patients, the pooled estimate of mean duration of positive viral detection in the URT was 15.8 days (CI: 11.12, 20.56) after symptom onset, 23.2 days (CI: 21.49, 24.97) in the LRT, 20.8 days (CI: 16.40, 25.17) in faeces. The maximum viral load was 4.60 x 109 copies\/mL on Day 8 in the URT, 3.45 x 108 copies\/mL on Day 11 in the LRT, 2.76 x 106 copies\/mL on Day 18 in faeces and 1 x 104 copies\/mL on Day 3 in blood. In children with mild symptoms, the pooled estimate of the mean duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 viral detection was 11.1 days (CI: 7.14, 15.11) in the URT and 16.0 days (CI: 11.49, 20,47) in the faeces, without reporting quantitative viral data. Viral positivity was detected in the urine and eye in one patient. Interpretation Our analysis showed consistent viral detection from specimen from the URT, the LRT and faeces, irrespective of the clinical severity of COVID-19. Our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 persists for a longer duration in the LRT compared to the URT, whereas the differences in the duration of viral detection between mild and moderate-severe patients is limited in the LRT, but an indication of longer duration of viral detection in feces and the URT for moderate-severe patients was shown. Further, viral load was demonstrated to peak in the URT within first weak of infection, whereas maximum viral load has been observed to occur later and within the second week of infection in the LRT.

Effective prioritization of these measures can be determined by understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of three parameters: (i) secondary attack rate (SAR) in various settings, (ii) clinical onset serial interval (SI), and (iii) the proportion of asymptomatic infection. Methods and Findings We searched PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, for articles describing SARS-CoV-2 attack rate, SI, and asymptomatic infection. Studies were included if they presented original data for estimating point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the three parameters. Random effects models were constructed to pool SAR, mean SI, and asymptomatic proportion. Risk ratios were used to examine differences in transmission risk by setting, type of contact, and symptom status of the index case. Publication and related bias were assessed by funnel plots and Egger's meta-regression test for small-study effects. Our search strategy for SAR, SI, and asymptomatic infection identified 459, 572, and 1624 studies respectively. Of these, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria for SAR, 18 studies for SI, and 66 studies for asymptomatic infection. We estimated the pooled household SAR at 15.4% (95% CI: 12.2%, 18.7%) compared to 4.0% (95% CI: 2.8%, 5.2%) in non-household settings. We observed variation across settings; however, the small number of studies limited power to detect associations and sources of heterogeneity. SAR of symptomatic index cases is significantly higher than cases that were symptom-free at diagnosis (RR 2.55, 95% CI: 1.47, 4.45). Adults appear to be more susceptible to transmission than children (RR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.96). The pooled mean SI is estimated at 4.87 days (95% CI: 3.98, 5.77). The pooled proportion of cases who had no symptoms at diagnosis is 25.9% (95% CI: 18.8%, 33.1%). Conclusions Based our pooled estimates, 10 infected symptomatic persons living with 100 contacts would result in 15 additional cases in <5 days. To be effective, quarantine of contacts should occur within 3 days of symptom onset. If testing and tracing relies on symptoms, one-quarter of cases would be missed. As such, while aggressive contact tracing strategies may be appropriate early in an outbreak, as it progresses, control measures should transition to account for SAR variability across settings. Targeted strategies focusing on high-density enclosed settings may be effective without overly restricting social movement.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wee Chian Koh","author_inst":"Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies"},{"author_name":"Lin Naing","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ali Rosledzana","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Fathi Alikhan","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Liling Chaw","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Matthew Griffith","author_inst":"Western Pacific Regional Office (Manila), World Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Roberta Pastore","author_inst":"Western Pacific Regional Office (Manila), World Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mantovani","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Surgery, University Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Wenmin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Wang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shan Li","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tieying Hou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108951","rel_title":"Effective Screening of SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies in Patient Serum using Lentivirus Particles Pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108951","rel_abs":"Pseuodotyped particles have significant importance and use in virology as tools for studying the biology of highly pathogenic viruses in a lower biosafety environment. The biological, chemical, and serological studies of the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly aided by the development and optimization of a suitable pseudotyping system. Here, we pseudotyped the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SPG) on a retroviral (MMLV) as well as a third generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the transduction efficiency in several mammalian cell lines expressing SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2. While MMLV pseudotyped the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) efficiently, it could not pseudotype SPG. In contrast, pLV pseudotyped both glycoproteins efficiently; however, much higher titers of pLV-G particles were produced. Among all the tested mammalian cells, 293Ts expressing hACE2 were most efficiently transduced using the pLV-S system. The pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by diluted serum (>:640) from a recently recovered COVID-19 patient who showed high SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG levels. In summary, pLV-S pseudotyped virus provides a valid screening tool for the presence of anti SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in convalescent patient serum.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ritesh Tandon","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dipanwita Mitra","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Poonam Sharma","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephan J Stray","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John T Bates","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gailen D Marshall","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Roberta Pastore","author_inst":"Western Pacific Regional Office (Manila), World Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mantovani","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Surgery, University Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Wenmin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Wang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shan Li","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tieying Hou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108639","rel_title":"Validation of the Kuwait Progression Indicator Score for predicting progression of severity in COVID19","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108639","rel_abs":"Introduction: Identifying patients with COVID19, at risk of having a severe clinical course during their hospitalization is important for appropriate allocation of clinical resources. We recently described the Kuwait Progression Indicator based on laboratory findings, in an initial training cohort derived from the first series of 1096 consecutive patients admitted to Jaber AlAhmad AlSabah Hospital in Kuwait. The aim of this study was to validate the KPI scoring system in an independent cohort of patients with COVID19. Methodology: Data was collected prospectively for consecutive patients admitted to Jaber AlAhmad AlSabah Hospital in Kuwait between 24th February till 28th April 2020. Patients were grouped according to the severity of their clinical course as their main outcome, based on clinical and radiological parameters, with ICU admission and death as secondary outcomes. Model discrimination was assessed through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) while model calibration was assessed through a calibration plot and measures of slope and calibration in the large (CITL). Results: Of 752 patients not used in model development previously, 414 met the criteria for inclusion in this validation study. The baseline characteristics for these 752 patients were similar to the patients that were included in our validation cohort. The area under the curve was equal to 0.904 (95% CI, between 0.867 to 0.942), indicating good model discrimination. The calibration plot and CITL confirmed reasonably good model calibration. Sensitivity and specificity were above 90% for the low and high risk levels respectively. Conclusions: We were able to validate our previously described laboratory based prognostic scoring system for COVID19 patients, to predict which patients progressed to a severe clinical course.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Al Youha","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Suhail A.

Prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in congregate shelters is high, but shelter characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission are currently unknown. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, multicenter cohort study across five congregate shelters in Rhode Island. We tested people 18 years of age and older staying in Rhode Island congregate shelters in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey instrument was designed and implemented based on an a priori sample size. All consented participants reported basic demographics, recent travel, duration of time at the shelter, any symptomatology, and had their temperature and pulse oximetry measured. Each participant was tested for COVID-19 using nasopharyngeal swabbing. Shelter characteristics about location, occupancy, resident length of stay, and COVID-19 mitigation strategies were collected through structured phone questionnaire with shelter staff. Results: A total of 302 individuals were screened and 299 participated across five homeless shelters. The median age was 47.9 (range 18-85) and 20% were female. Of the 299 participants, 35 (11.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2; rates varied among shelters, ranging from 0% to 35%. Among the participants in the study, 5% had a new cough, 4% shortness of breath, and 3% reported loss of taste or smell. Symptom prevalence did not vary significantly between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 groups. Regular symptom screening was not associated with lower infection rates. Shelters with higher rates of positivity were in more densely populated areas, cared for a more transient populations, and instituted fewer social distancing practices for sleeping arrangements or mealtimes. Conclusions and Relevance: Residents of congregate shelters are at increased risk for asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. To reduce transmission and enable continuation of low-threshold shelter services, there is a need for universal testing, implementation of infection control and physical distancing measures within congregate shelters, and expansion of non-congregate supportive housing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Samuels","author_inst":"Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Karb","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Rahul Vanjani","author_inst":"Division of General Internal Medicine, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"M.

However, the effectiveness of these drugs in large populations is unclear. Subjects and Methods: As of May 2020, data analysis was conducted on all subjects who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health Review and Assessment Service database in Korea. Using the COVID-19 and claims data of the past 5 years, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade. Results: Totally, data of 67850 subjects were accessible. Of these, 5080 were confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6%) and 327 (39.3%) were DPP-4i and RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09%) received intensive care or died. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.362 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.135-0.971], and that for RAS blockade users was 0.599 (95% CI, 0.251-1.431). No synergy was observed for subjects using both drugs. Conclusion: This population-based study suggests that DPP-4i is significantly associated with a better clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. However, the effect of RAS blockade is not significant.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sang Youl Rhee","author_inst":"Kyung Hee University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeongwoo Lee","author_inst":"Hanmi Pharm.

By calibrating the parameters of the EDM to the reported data in Hubei Province of China, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak. We compare the EDM applied to WR and the Gompertz model, which is based on exponential decay and is often used to estimate cumulative events. Specifically, we assess the performance of each model to short-term forecast of the epidemic, and to predict the final epidemic size. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the model applied to data from February 27 until the 17st of March estimate that the cumulative number of infected could reach 131,280 (with a credibility interval 71,415-263,501) by April 25 (credibility interval April 12 to May 3). With the data available until the 24st of March the peak date should be reached on May 3 (April 23 to May 23) with 197,179 cumulative infections expected (130033-315,269); with data available until the 31st of March the peak should be reached on May 4 (April 25 to May 18) with 202,210 cumulative infections expected (155.235-270,737); with data available until the 07st of April the peak should be reached on May 3 (April 26 to May 11) with 191,586 (160,861-232,023) cumulative infections expected. Based on the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), cumulated infections forecasts provided by the EDM applied to WR performed better across all scenarios than the Gompertz model. An exponential decay model applied to the cumulated and weighted average daily growth rate appears to be useful in estimating the number of cases and peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and the model was more reliable in the exponential growth phase.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Bartolomeo","author_inst":"University of Bari Aldo Moro"},{"author_name":"Paolo Trerotoli","author_inst":"University of Bari Aldo Moro"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Serio","author_inst":"University of Bari Aldo Moro"},{"author_name":"Dae-Sung Kyoung","author_inst":"Hanmi Pharm.
