These drugs have warning labels for use in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Analysis of whole-genome sequence data of 458 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa showed significant G6PD variation across the continent. We identified nine variants, of which four are potentially deleterious to G6PD function, and one (rs1050828) that is known to cause G6PD deficiency. We supplemented data for the rs1050828 variant with genotype array data from over 11,000 Africans. Although this variant is common in Africans overall, large allele frequency differences exist between sub-populations. African sub-populations in the same country can show significant differences in allele frequency (e.g. 16.0% in Tsonga vs 0.8% in Xhosa, both in South Africa, {rho}=2.4x10-3). The high prevalence of variants in the G6PD gene found in this analysis suggests that it may be a significant interaction factor in clinical trials of chloroquine and hydrochloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 in Africans.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge da Rocha","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Houcemeddine Othman","author_inst":"Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa."},{"author_name":"Caroline T Tiemessen","author_inst":"Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Services and Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Wit"},{"author_name":"Gerrit Botha","author_inst":"Computational Biology Division and H3ABioNet, Department of Integrative Biomedical Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa."},{"author_name":"Michele Ramsay","author_inst":"Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience, and Division of Human Genetics, National Health Laboratory Service, and School of Pathology, Faculty of Healt"},{"author_name":"Collen Masimirembwa","author_inst":"Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa."},{"author_name":"Clement Adebamowo","author_inst":"Institute for Human Virology, Abuja, Nigeria; Institute of Human Virology and Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine,"},{"author_name":"Ananyo Choudhury","author_inst":"Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jean-Tristan Brandenburg","author_inst":"Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Mogomotsi Matshaba","author_inst":"Botswana-Baylor Children's Clinical Center of Excellence, Gaborone, Botswana.; Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, United States."},{"author_name":"Gustave Simo","author_inst":"Molecular Parasitology and Entomology Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon."},{"author_name":"Francisco-Javier Gamo","author_inst":"Global Health, GlaxoSmithKline R\\&D, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Scott Hazelhurst","author_inst":"School of Electrical \\& Information Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa;  Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20115253","rel_title":"The COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium observational study: Design and rationale of a prospective, international, multicenter, observational study","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20115253","rel_abs":"Importance: There is a paucity of data that can be used to guide the management of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Global collaboration offers the best chance of obtaining these data, at scale and in time. In the absence of effective therapies, insights derived from real-time observational data will be a crucial means of improving outcomes. Objective: In response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, a research and data-sharing collaborative has been assembled to harness the cumulative experience of intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. The resulting observational study provides a platform to rapidly disseminate detailed data and insights. Design: The COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium observational study is an international, multicenter, prospective, observational study of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to ICUs. Setting: This is an evolving, open-ended study that commenced on January 1st, 2020 and currently includes more than 350 sites in over 48 countries. The study enrolls patients at the time of ICU admission and follows them to the time of death, hospital discharge, or 28 days post-ICU admission, whichever occurs last. Participants: All subjects, without age limit, requiring admission to an ICU for SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and\/or next-generation sequencing or with high clinical suspicion of the infection. Patients admitted to an ICU for any other reason are excluded. Main outcomes and measures: Key data, collected via an electronic case report form devised in collaboration with the ISARIC\/SPRINT-SARI networks, include: patient demographic data and risk factors, clinical features, severity of illness and respiratory failure, need for non-invasive and\/or mechanical ventilation and\/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and associated complications, as well as data on adjunctive therapies. Final outcomes of in-hospital death, discharge or continuing admissions at 28 days. Discussion: This large-scale, observational study of COVID-19 in the critically ill will provide rapid international characterization. Open-ended accrual will increase the power to answer hypothesis-led questions over time. Several sub-studies have already been initiated, examining hemostasis, neurological, cardiac, and long-term outcomes.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianluigi Li Bassi","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Jacky Suen","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Adrian G Barnett","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Amanda Corley","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Jonathan E.

Methods We undertook a prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 in a single ED in England. We used univariate and multiple logistic regression to examine whether the presence and severity of T1RF in the ED was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Results 180 patients with suspected COVID19 infection met the inclusion criteria for this study, of which 39 (22%) died. Severity of T1RF was associated with increased mortality with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals of 1.58 (0.49 to 5.14), 3.60 (1.23 to 10.6) and 18.5 (5.65 to 60.8) for mild, moderate and severe T1RF, respectively. After adjusting for age, gender, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, neutrophil-lymphocyte ration (NLR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the association remained, with ORs of 0.63 (0.13 to 3.03), 3.95 (0.94 to 16.6) and 45.8 (7.25 to 290). The results were consistent across a number of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Severity of T1RF in the ED is an important prognostic factor of mortality in patients admitted with suspected COVID19 infection. Current prediction models frequently do not include this factor and should be applied with caution. Further large scale research on predictors of mortality in COVID19 infection should include SpO2\/eFiO2 ratios or a similar measure of respiratory dysfunction.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johannes von Vopelius-Feldt","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust, Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watson","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust, Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"Carla Swanson-Low","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust, Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"James Cameron","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust, Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"Luigi Sedda","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Martin Farrier","author_inst":"Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"India Lye","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sebastiano Colombo","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Karin Wildi","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Samantha Livingstone","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Abbate","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Samuel Hinton","author_inst":"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Benoit Liquet","author_inst":"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sally Shrapnel","author_inst":"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Heidi J Dalton","author_inst":"INOVA Fairfax Medical Center, Heart and Vascular Institute, Falls Church VA, USA"},{"author_name":"John F Fraser","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115394","rel_title":"Rapid Epidemiological Analysis of Comorbidities andTreatments as risk factors for COVID-19 in Scotland(REACT-SCOT): a population-based case-control study","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115394","rel_abs":"Background -- The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 and to lay the basis for risk stratification based on demographic data and health records. Methods and Findings -- The design was a matched case-control study. Severe COVID-19 was defined as either a positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 in the national database followed by entry to a critical care unit or death within 28 days, or a death certificate with COVID-19 as underlying cause. Up to ten controls per case matched for sex, age and primary care practice were selected from the population register. All diagnostic codes from the past five years of hospitalisation records and all drug codes from prescriptions dispensed during the past nine months were extracted. Rate ratios for severe COVID-19 were estimated by conditional logistic regression. There were 4272 severe cases. In a logistic regression using the age-sex distribution of the national population, the odds ratios for severe disease were 2.87 for a 10-year increase in age and 1.63 for male sex. In the case-control analysis, the strongest risk factor was residence in a care home, with rate ratio (95% CI) 21.4 (19.1, 23.9). Univariate rate ratios (95% CIs) for conditions listed by public health agencies as conferring high risk were 2.75 (1.96, 3.88) for Type 1 diabetes, 1.60 (1.48, 1.74) for Type 2 diabetes, 1.49 (1.37, 1.61) for ischemic heart disease, 2.23 (2.08, 2.39) for other heart disease, 1.96 (1.83, 2.10) for chronic lower respiratory tract disease, 4.06 (3.15, 5.23) for chronic kidney disease, 5.4 (4.9, 5.8) for neurological disease, 3.61 (2.60, 5.00) for chronic liver disease and 2.66 (1.86, 3.79) for immune deficiency or suppression. 78% of cases and 52% of controls had at least one listed condition (NA of cases and NA of controls under age 40). Severe disease was associated with encashment of at least one prescription in the past nine months and with at least one hospital admission in the past five years [rate ratios 3.10 (2.59, 3.71)] and 2.75 (2.53, 2.99) respectively] even after adjusting for the listed conditions. In those without listed conditions significant associations with severe disease were seen across many hospital diagnoses and drug categories. Age and sex provided 2.58 bits of information for discrimination. A model based on demographic variables, listed conditions, hospital diagnoses and prescriptions provided an additional 1.25 bits (C-statistic 0.825). A limitation of this study is that records from primary care were not available. Conclusions -- Along with older age and male sex, severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with past medical history across all age groups. Many comorbidities beyond the risk conditions designated by public health agencies contribute to this. A risk classifier that uses all the information available in health records, rather than only a limited set of conditions, will more accurately discriminate between low-risk and high-risk individuals who may require shielding until the epidemic is over.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul M McKeigue","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Amanda Weir","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jen Bishop","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Stuart McGurnaghan","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sharon Kennedy","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"David McAllister","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20090811","rel_title":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Among Healthcare Workers at a Tertiary Academic Hospital in New York City","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20090811","rel_abs":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is important for understanding immunity prevalence, and may have implications for healthcare workers (HCW) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: We conducted immunologic testing of healthcare workers to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in this population. HCW were advised to wait at least two weeks from time of symptom onset or suspected exposure before undergoing testing. All participants were self-reported asymptomatic for at least three days at the time of testing. Results: Two hundred eighty-five samples were collected from March 24, 2020 to April 4, 2020. The average age of participants was 38 years (range 18-84), and 54% were male. Thirty-three percept tested IgG positive, 3% tested weakly positive, and 64% tested negative. Neither age nor sex was associated with antibody development. Conclusion: Thirty-six percent of HCW had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, reflecting the high exposure of inpatient and ambulatory frontline staff to this viral illness, most of whom had minimal symptoms and were working in the weeks preceding testing. While we continue to recommend standard protective precautions per CDC guidelines for all HCW, HCW with SARS-CoV-2 IgG may become our safest frontline providers as we learn if our IgG antibodies confer immunity. Knowing IgG antibody status may ease concerns regarding personal risk as this pandemic continues.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayce Mansour","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emily Levin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Muellers","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Stone","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ania Wajnberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114348","rel_title":"Clinical features of COVID-19 patients in Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital, Samarinda, Indonesia","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114348","rel_abs":"Introduction Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indonesia officially established the first COVID-19 confirmation case in early March 2020. East Kalimantan has been determined as a candidate for the new capital of Indonesia since 2019. This makes Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital Samarinda as the largest hospital there has been designated as the main referral hospital for COVID-19 patients in East Kalimantan. We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of these patients. Methods All patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR were admitted to Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital in Samarinda. We retrospectively collected and analyzed data on patients with standardized data collection from medical records. Results By May 8, 2020, 18 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Most of the infected patients were men (16 [88.9%] patients); less than half had underlying diseases (7 [38.9%] patients). Common symptoms at the onset of illness were cough (16 [88.9%] patients), sore throat (8 [44.4%] patients), and fever (8 [44.4%] patients). Laboratory findings of some patients on admission showed anemia. Levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were increased in 10 (55.6%) of 18 patients. On admission, abnormalities in chest x-ray images were detected in 6 (33.3%) patients who had pneumonia. The mean duration from the first hospital admission to discharge was 33.1 days. Discussion The majority of COVID-19 patients are male. COVID-19 comorbidities were found in several patients. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in this study were cough, sore throat, and fever. The abnormal laboratory finding in COVID-19 patients is anemia, an increase in AST and ALT levels, and chest x-ray images of pneumonia. All patients are in mild condition. The average length of hospital admission patients to discharge is more than 30 days. Conclusion Although all patients are in mild condition, the inability of a local laboratory to check for positive confirmation of COVID-19 makes the admission period of the patient in the hospital very long. The availability of RT-PCR tests at Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital Samarinda will greatly assist the further management of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swandari Paramita","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mulawarman University, Samarinda, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Ronny Isnuwardana","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mulawarman University, Samarinda, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Marwan Marwan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mulawarman University, Samarinda, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Donny Irfandi Alfian","author_inst":"Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital, Samarinda, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"David Hariadi Masjhoer","author_inst":"Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital, Samarinda, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Ania Wajnberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.127019","rel_title":"INSIGHT: a scalable isothermal NASBA-based platform for COVID-19 diagnosis","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.127019","rel_abs":"We present INSIGHT (Isothermal NASBA-Sequencing-based hIGH-througput Test): a two-stage COVID-19 testing strategy, using a barcoded isothermal NASBA reaction that combines point-of-care diagnosis with next generation sequencing, aiming to achieve population-scale COVID-19 testing. INSIGHT combines the advantages of near-patient with centralised testing. Stage 1 allows a quick decentralised readout for early isolation of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. The same reaction products can then be used in a highly multiplexed sequencing-based assay in Stage 2, confirming the near-patient testing results and facilitating centralised data collection. Based on experiments using commercially acquired human saliva with spiked-in viral RNA as input, the INSIGHT platform gives Stage 1 results within one to two hours, using either fluorescence detection or a lateral flow (dipstick) readout, whilst simultaneously incorporating sample-specific barcodes into the amplification product. INSIGHT Stage 2 can be performed by directly pooling and sequencing all post-amplification barcoded Stage 1 products from hundreds of thousands of samples with minimal sample preparation steps. The 95% limit of detection (LoD-95) for INSIGHT is estimated to be below 50 copies of viral RNA per 20 l of reaction. Our two-stage testing strategy is suitable for further development into a rapid home-based and point-of-care assay, and is potentially scalable to the population level.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qianxin Wu","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK."},{"author_name":"Chenqu Suo","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK; Department of Paediatrics, Cambridge University Hospitals, Hills Road, Cambr"},{"author_name":"Tom Brown","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Chemistry Research Laboratory, 12 Mansfield Road, Oxford OX1 3TA, UK."},{"author_name":"Tengyao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Statistical Science, University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place, London WC1E 7HB, UK."},{"author_name":"Sarah A Teichmann","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK; Department of Physics\/Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, JJ Thom"},{"author_name":"Andrew R Bassett","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK."},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.130484","rel_title":"HiDRA-seq: High-Throughput SARS-CoV-2 Detection by RNA Barcoding and Amplicon Sequencing","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.130484","rel_abs":"The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus that causes a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in humans (SARS-CoV-2) has developed into a global pandemic with over 6 million reported cases and more than 375,000 deaths worldwide.

The inability to implement high throughput diagnostic and contact tracing strategies has forced many countries to institute lockdowns with severe economic and social consequences. The World Health Organization (WHO) has encouraged affected countries to increase testing capabilities to identify new cases, allow for a well-controlled lifting of lockdown measures, and prepare for future outbreaks. Here, we propose HiDRA-seq, a rapidly implementable, high throughput, and scalable solution that uses NGS lab infrastructure and reagents for population-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing. This method is based on the use of indexed oligo-dT primers to generate barcoded cDNA from a large number of patient samples. From this, highly multiplexed NGS libraries are prepared targeting SARS-CoV-2 specific regions and sequenced. The low amount of sequencing data required for diagnosis allows the combination of thousands of samples in a sequencing run, while reducing the cost to approximately 2 CHF\/EUR\/USD per RNA sample. Here, we describe in detail the first version of the protocol, which can be further improved in the future to increase its sensitivity and to identify other respiratory viruses or analyze individual genetic features associated with disease progression.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emilio Yanguez","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Griffin White","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Susanne Kreutzer","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Lennart Opitz","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Lucy Poveda","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Timothy Sykes","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Maria Domenica Moccia","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Catharine Aquino","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Ralph Schlapbach","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.129312","rel_title":"System Dynamics Modeling Of Within-Host Viral Kinetics Of Coronavirus (SARS CoV-2)","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.129312","rel_abs":"Mathematical models are being used extensively in the study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, becoming an essential tool for decision making concerning disease control.

etiologic agent of COVID-19, currently causing a devastating pandemic for which pharmacological interventions are urgently needed. The virus enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. The nanobody binds with high affinity in the low nM range to the RBD, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 conformations and that Ty1 sterically hinders RBD-ACE2 binding. This 12.8 kDa nanobody does not need an Fc domain to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leo Hanke","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Maria Laura Perez Vidakovics","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Daniel Sheward","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Hrishikesh Das","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tim Schulte","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ainhoa Moliner Morro","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Martin Corcoran","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Adnane Achour","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"B.

The severity of Covid-19, the exponential rate at which the virus proliferates, and the rapid exhaustion of the public health resources are critical factors. The RT-PCR with virus DNA identification is still the benchmark Covid-19 diagnosis method. In this work we propose a new technique for representing DNA sequences: they are divided into smaller sequences with overlap in a pseudo-convolutional approach, and represented by co-occurrence matrices. This technique analyzes the DNA sequences obtained by the RT-PCR method, eliminating sequence alignment. Through the proposed method, it is possible to identify virus sequences from a large database: 347,363 virus DNA sequences from 24 virus families and SARS-Cov-2. Experiments with all 24 virus families and SARS-Cov-2 (multi-class scenario) resulted 0.822222 {+\/-} 0.05613 for sensitivity and 0.99974 {+\/-} 0.00001 for specificity using Random Forests with 100 trees and 30% overlap. When we compared SARS-Cov-2 with similar-symptoms virus families, we got 0.97059 {+\/-} 0.03387 for sensitivity, and 0.99187 {+\/-} 0.00046 for specificity with MLP classifier and 30% overlap. In the real test scenario, in which SARS-Cov-2 is compared to Coronaviridae and healthy human DNA sequences, we got 0.98824 {+\/-} 001198 for sensitivity and 0.99860 {+\/-} 0.00020 for specificity with MLP and 50% overlap. Therefore, the molecular diagnosis of Covid-19 can be optimized by combining RT-PCR and our pseudo-convolutional method to identify SARS-Cov-2 DNA sequences faster with higher specificity and sensitivity.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Aras Ismael Masood","author_inst":"Sulaimani Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Leandro Honorato de S.

Our group was interested in the feasibility of ozone disinfection of N95 respirators as an alternative for healthcare professionals and organizations that might not have access to other disinfection devices. We tested the effectiveness of ozone on killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) on three different N95 respirators: 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M 8000. We used an ozone chamber that consisted of: an airtight chamber, an ozone generator, an ozone destruct unit, and an ozone UV analyzer. The chamber was capable of concentrating ozone up to 500 parts per million (ppm) from ambient air, creating an airtight seal, and precisely measuring ozone levels within the chamber. Exposure to ozone at 400 ppm with 80% humidity for two hours effectively killed bacteria on N95 respirators, types 1860, 1870, and 8000. There were no significant changes in filtration efficiency of the 1860 and 1870 type respirators for up to ten cycles of ozone exposure at similar conditions. There was no change in fit observed in the 1870 type respirator after ozone exposure. There was no significant change in the strap integrity of the 1870 type respirator after ozone exposure. Tests for filtration efficiency were not performed on the 8000 type respirator. Tests for fit or strap integrity were not performed on the 8000 or 1860 type respirators. This study demonstrates that an ozone application achieves a high level of disinfection against PsA, a vegetative bacteria that the CDC identifies as more difficult to kill than medium sized viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19). Furthermore, conditions shown to kill these bacteria did not damage or degrade respirator filtration. This is the first report of successful disinfection of N95 PPE with ozone of which the authors are aware. It is also the first report, to the authors' knowledge, to identify necessary conditions for ozone to kill organisms on N95 masks without degrading the function of N95 filters.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward P Manning","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Stephens","author_inst":"Air Liquide Advanced Materials, Branchburg, NJ"},{"author_name":"Sannel Patel","author_inst":"Ozone Solutions, Hull, IA"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Dufresne","author_inst":"IM3 Consulting Group, Quebec City, QC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bruce Silver","author_inst":"Silver Dental Associates, LLC, Burlington, NJ"},{"author_name":"Patricia Gerbarg","author_inst":"Department of Behavioral Sciences, New York Medical College, Valahalla, NY"},{"author_name":"Zach Gerbarg","author_inst":"Gerbarg & Associates, Inc, Scottsdale, AZ"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT"},{"author_name":"Lokesh Sharma","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gerald M McInerney","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jianhui Nie","author_inst":"Division of HIV\/AIDS and Sex-Transmitted Virus Vaccines, Institute for Biological Product Control, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC), Beijin"},{"author_name":"Zhen Cui","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China"},{"author_name":"Dandan Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China"},{"author_name":"Neil Shaw","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Feng Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Qianqian Li","author_inst":"Division of HIV\/AIDS and Sex-Transmitted Virus Vaccines, Institute for Biological Product Control, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC), Beijin"},{"author_name":"Liangzhi Xie","author_inst":"Beijing Protein and Antibody R&D Engineering Center, Sinocelltech Ltd., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Youchun Wang","author_inst":"Division of HIV\/AIDS and Sex-Transmitted Virus Vaccines, Institute for Biological Product Control, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC), Beijin"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"12CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, 13Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, C"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20083287","rel_title":"Estimating excess mortality in people with cancer and multimorbidity in the COVID-19 emergency","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20083287","rel_abs":"Background: Cancer and multiple non-cancer conditions are considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as high risk conditions in the COVID-19 emergency. Professional societies have recommended changes in cancer service provision to minimize COVID-19 risks to cancer patients and health care workers. However, we do not know the extent to which cancer patients, in whom multi-morbidity is common, may be at higher overall risk of mortality as a net result of multiple factors including COVID-19 infection, changes in health services, and socioeconomic factors. Methods: We report multi-center, weekly cancer diagnostic referrals and chemotherapy treatments until April 2020 in England and Northern Ireland. We analyzed population-based health records from 3,862,012 adults in England to estimate 1-year mortality in 24 cancer sites and 15 non-cancer comorbidity clusters (40 conditions) recognized by CDC as high-risk. We estimated overall (direct and indirect) effects of COVID-19 emergency on mortality under different Relative Impact of the Emergency (RIE) and different Proportions of the population Affected by the Emergency (PAE). We applied the same model to the US, using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data. Results: Weekly data until April 2020 demonstrate significant falls in admissions for chemotherapy (45-66% reduction) and urgent referrals for early cancer diagnosis (70-89% reduction), compared to pre-emergency levels. Under conservative assumptions of the emergency affecting only people with newly diagnosed cancer (incident cases) at COVID-19 PAE of 40%, and an RIE of 1.5, the model estimated 6,270 excess deaths at 1 year in England and 33,890 excess deaths in the US. In England, the proportion of patients with incident cancer with [&ge;]1 comorbidity was 65.2%. The number of comorbidities was strongly associated with cancer mortality risk. Across a range of model assumptions, and across incident and prevalent cancer cases, 78% of excess deaths occur in cancer patients with [&ge;]1 comorbidity. Conclusion: We provide the first estimates of potential excess mortality among people with cancer and multimorbidity due to the COVID-19 emergency and demonstrate dramatic changes in cancer services. To better inform prioritization of cancer care and guide policy change, there is an urgent need for weekly data on cause-specific excess mortality, cancer diagnosis and treatment provision and better intelligence on the use of effective treatments for comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alvina G Lai","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura Pasea","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Michail Katsoulis","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wai Hoong Chang","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Bryan Williams","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"David Linch","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Derralynn Hughes","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin D Forster","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Clare Turnbull","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Natalie K Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Boyd","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Cancer Network"},{"author_name":"Graham R Foster","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Matt Cooper","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Monica Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Kathy Pritchard-Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Richard Sullivan","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Hall","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Charlie Davie","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Mark Lawler","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.120998","rel_title":"Pathogenesis, transmission and response to re-exposure of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic cats","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.120998","rel_abs":"The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has reached nearly every country in the world with extraordinary person-to-person transmission. The most likely original source of the virus was spillover from an animal reservoir and subsequent adaptation to humans sometime during the winter of 2019 in Wuhan Province, China. Because of its genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-1, it is likely that this novel virus has a similar host range and receptor specificity. Due to concern for human-pet transmission, we investigated the susceptibility of domestic cats and dogs to infection and potential for infected cats to transmit to naive cats. We report that cats are highly susceptible to subclinical infection, with a prolonged period of oral and nasal viral shedding that is not accompanied by clinical signs, and are capable of direct contact transmission to other cats. These studies confirm that cats are susceptible to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, but are unlikely to develop clinical disease. Further, we document that cats develop a robust neutralizing antibody response that prevented re-infection to a second viral challenge. Conversely, we found that dogs do not shed virus following infection, but do mount an anti-viral neutralizing antibody response. There is currently no evidence that cats or dogs play a significant role in human exposure; however, reverse zoonosis is possible if infected owners expose their domestic pets during acute infection. Resistance to re-exposure holds promise that a vaccine strategy may protect cats, and by extension humans, to disease susceptibility.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angela Bosco-Lauth","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Airn E.

This staggered implementation combined with the heterogeneity of the U.S. complicates quantification the effect of NPIs on the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2. We describe a data-driven approach to quantify the effect of NPIs that relies on county-level similarities to specialize a Bayesian mechanistic model based on observed fatalities. Using this approach, we estimate change in reproductive rate, R_t, due to implementation of NPIs in 1,417 U.S. counties. We estimate that as of May 28th, 2020 1,177 out of the considered 1,417 U.S. counties have reduced the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 to below 1.0. The estimated effect of any individual NPI, however, is different across counties. Stay-at-home orders were estimated as the only effective NPI in metropolitan and urban counties, while advisory NPIs were estimated to be effective in more rural counties. The expected level of infection predicted by the model ranges from 0 to 28.7% and is far from herd immunity even in counties with advanced spread.

As evidence is emerging that these measures may have slowed the spread of the pandemic, it is important to assess the impact of any changes in strategy, including scenarios for school reopening and broader relaxation of social distancing. This work uses an individual-based model to predict the impact of a suite of possible strategies to reopen schools in the UK, including that currently proposed by the UK government. Methods We use Covasim, a stochastic agent-based model for transmission of COVID-19, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals' contact networks stratified as household, school, work and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulate a range of different school reopening strategies with a society-wide relaxation of lockdown measures and in the presence of different non-pharmaceutical interventions, to estimate the number of new infections, cumulative cases and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number with different strategies. To account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated different levels of infectiousness of children and young adults under 20 years old compared to older ages. Findings We found that with increased levels of testing of people (between 25% and 72% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active COVID-19 infection depending on scenarios) and effective contact-tracing and isolation for infected individuals, an epidemic rebound may be prevented across all reopening scenarios, with the effective reproduction number (R) remaining below one and the cumulative number of new infections and deaths significantly lower than they would be if testing did not increase. If UK schools reopen in phases from June 2020, prevention of a second wave would require testing 51% of symptomatic infections, tracing of 40% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases. However, without such measures, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a secondary pandemic wave, as are other scenarios for reopening. When infectiousness of <20 year olds was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, our findings remained unchanged. Interpretation To prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave, relaxation of social distancing including reopening schools in the UK must be implemented alongside an active large-scale population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed individuals. Such combined measures have a greater likelihood of controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing a large number of COVID-19 deaths than reopening schools and society with the current level of implementation of testing and isolation of infected individuals.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Cliff Kerr","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Robyn Margaret Stuart","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Dina Mistry","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Daniel Klein","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Russell M Viner","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond St. Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Chris Bonell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Izabela Ragan","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rachel Maison","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Bowen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Derralynn Hughes","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin D Forster","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Clare Turnbull","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Natalie K Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Boyd","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Cancer Network"},{"author_name":"Graham R Foster","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Matt Cooper","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Monica Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Kathy Pritchard-Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Richard Sullivan","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Hall","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Charlie Davie","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Mark Lawler","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20118885","rel_title":"Modelling testing frequencies required for early detection of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on a university campus","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20118885","rel_abs":"Background: Early detection and risk mitigation efforts are essential for averting large outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. Active surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 can aid in early detection of outbreaks, but the testing frequency required to identify an outbreak at its earliest stage is unknown. We assess what testing frequency is required to detect an outbreak before there are 10 detectable infections. Methods: A dynamic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 was developed to simulate spread among a university community. After introducing a single infection into a fully susceptible population, we calculate the probability of detecting at least one case on each succeeding day with various NAT testing frequencies (daily testing achieving 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the population tested per month) assuming an 85% test sensitivity. A proportion of infected individuals (varied from 1-60%) are assumed to present to health services (HS) for symptomatic testing. We ascertain the expected number of detectable infections in the community when there is a >90% probability of detecting at least 1 case. Sensitivity analyses examine impact of transmission rates (Rt=0=2, 2.5,3), presentation to HS (1%\/5%\/30%\/60%), and pre-existing immunity (0%\/10%) Results: Assuming an 85% test sensitivity, identifying an outbreak with 90% probability when the expected number of detectable infections is 9 or fewer requires NAT testing of 100% of the population per month; this result holds for all transmission rates and all levels of presentation at health services we considered. . If 1% of infected people present at HS and Rt=0=3, testing 75%\/50%\/25% per month could identify an outbreak when the expected numbers of detectable infections are 12\/17\/30 respectively; these numbers decline to 9\/11\/12 if 30% of infected people present at HS . As proportion of infected individuals present at health services increases, the marginal impact of active surveillance is reduced. Higher transmission rates result in shorter time to detection but also rapidly escalating cases without intervention. Little differences were observed with 10% pre-existing immunity. Conclusions: Widespread testing of 100% of the campus population every month is required to detect an outbreak when there are fewer than 9 detectable infections for the scenarios examined, but high presentation of symptomatic people at HS can compensate in part for lower levels of testing. Early detection is necessary, but not sufficient, to curtail disease outbreaks; the proposed testing rates would need to be accompanied by case isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and other risk mitigation and social distancing interventions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natasha Martin","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Robert T Schooley","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Victor De Gruttola","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Dina Mistry","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Daniel Klein","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Russell M Viner","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond St. Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Chris Bonell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Izabela Ragan","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rachel Maison","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Bowen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Derralynn Hughes","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin D Forster","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Clare Turnbull","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Natalie K Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Boyd","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Cancer Network"},{"author_name":"Graham R Foster","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Matt Cooper","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Monica Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Kathy Pritchard-Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Richard Sullivan","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Hall","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Charlie Davie","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Mark Lawler","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20118901","rel_title":"Rapid systematic review on clinical evidence of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19: critical assessment and recommendation for future clinical trials","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20118901","rel_abs":"Purpose: This study aims to critically assess the published studies of Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the treatment of COVID-19 and provide recommendations for future clinical trials for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Three clinical trial registry platforms, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Register were also complementarily searched. Results: A total of 10 clinical studies were identified, including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 comparative nonrandomized trial, 5 single-arm trials, and 1 interim analysis. The heterogeneity among studies of the baseline disease severity and reported endpoints made a pooled analysis impossible. CQ and HCQ (with or without azithromycin) showed significant therapeutic benefit in terms of virologic clearance rate, improvement in symptoms and imaging findings, time to clinical recovery, and length of hospital stay in 1 RCT, 4 single-arm trials, and the interim analysis, whereas no treatment benefit of CQ or HCQ was observed in the remaining 4 studies. Limitations of the included studies ranged from small sample size, to insufficient information concerning baseline patient characteristics, to potential for selection bias without detailing the rationale for exclusion, and presence of confounding factors. Conclusion: Based on the studies evaluated, there still lacked solid evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ as a treatment for COVID-19 with or without azithromycin.

Conflicting reports exist regarding the impact of smoking on the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS We carried out a population-based study among over 3,000,000 adult members of Clalit Health Services, the largest health provider in Israel. Since the beginning of the disease outbreak, 114,545 individuals underwent RT-PCR testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and 4.0% had positive results. We performed a case-control study among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, to assess the impact of smoking on infection incidence and severity. Individuals with positive tests were matched in a 1:5 ratio to individuals tested negative, of the same sex, age, and ethnicity\/religion. Conditional logistic regressions were performed to evaluate odds ratios for current and previous smoking on the risk of testing positive. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among patients infected with COVID-19 to estimate the association between smoking and fatal or severe disease requiring ventilation. Regressions were performed with and without adjustment for preexisting medical conditions. RESULTS In the matched cohort, current smokers (9.8%) were significantly less prevalent among members tested positive compared to the general population, and to matched members tested negative (19.4%, P<0.001). Current smoking was associated with significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) for testing positive OR=0.457 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.407-0.514). Among patients tested positive, there was no evidence of significantly increased risk of developing severe or fatal disease. CONCLUSION The risk of infection by COVID-19 appears to be reduced by half among current smokers. This intriguing finding may reveal unique infection mechanisms present for COVID-19 which may be targeted to combat the disease and reduce its infection rate.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ariel Israel","author_inst":"Department of Research and Data, Division of Planning and Strategy, Clalit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ilan Feldhamer","author_inst":"Department of Research and Data, Division of Planning and Strategy, Clalit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Amnon Lahad","author_inst":"Departments of Family Medicine, Clalit Health Services and Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Diane Levin-Zamir","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services; University of Haifa School of Public Health, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gil Lavie","author_inst":"Division of Planning and Strategy, Clalit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel; Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technolo"},{"author_name":"Anna Nowotarska","author_inst":"Creativ-Ceutical company"},{"author_name":"Mondher Toumi","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Izabela Ragan","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rachel Maison","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Bowen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Derralynn Hughes","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin D Forster","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Clare Turnbull","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Natalie K Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Boyd","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Cancer Network"},{"author_name":"Graham R Foster","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Matt Cooper","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Monica Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Kathy Pritchard-Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Richard Sullivan","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Hall","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Charlie Davie","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Mark Lawler","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20097097","rel_title":"Population mobility reductions during COVID-19 epidemic in France under lockdown","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20097097","rel_abs":"On March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond to COVID-19 epidemic and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care, similarly to other countries. Evaluating the impact of lockdown on population mobility is essential to quantify achievable reductions and identify the factors driving the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. We used temporally resolved travel flows among 1,436 administrative areas of mainland France reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories. We measured mobility changes before and during lockdown at both local and country scales. Lockdown caused a 65% reduction in countrywide number of displacements, and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hours, and recreational trips. Geographical heterogeneities showed anomalous increases in long-range movements even before lockdown announcement that were tightly localized in space. During lockdown, mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions. They were strongly associated with active population, workers employed in sectors highly impacted by lockdown, and number of hospitalizations per region, and moderately associated with socio-economic level of the region. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting. Lockdown was effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation, as anomalous mobility followed policy announcements that may act as seeding events. On the other hand, risk aversion may be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in largely affected regions. Socio-economic and demographic constraints to the efficacy of restrictions were also identified. The unveiled links between geography, demography, and timing of the response to mobility restrictions may help design interventions that minimize invasiveness while contributing to the current epidemic response.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"INSERM\/ORANGE S.A."},{"author_name":"Eugenio Valdano","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Nicola Scarpa","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Stefania Rubrichi","author_inst":"Orange S.

To evaluate the effect of breastfeeding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the presence of SARS-CoV-2, IgG and IgM in breast milk, maternal blood and infant blood were assessed. Feeding patterns were also recorded in follow-up. Results: No positive detection for SARS-CoV-2 of neonates was found. All breast milk samples were negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of IgM ofSARS-CoV-2 in breast milk was correlated with maternal blood. The results of IgG detection for SARS-CoV-2 were negative in all breast milk samples. All the infants were in healthy condition while six of them were fed with whole or partial breast milk. Eight infants received antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 in one month after birth and the results were all negative.

Methods We conducted an observational study at two large urban academic Level 1 trauma centers. Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test from March 1st, 2020 to April 27, 2020 were included. Individuals younger than 18 years of age, without any documented delirium assessments (CAM-ICU), or without a discharge disposition were excluded. The primary outcomes were delirium rates and delirium duration and the secondary outcome was delirium severity. Outcomes were assessed for up to the first 14 days of ICU stay. Results Of 243 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, 144 met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. Delirium occurred in 73.6% (106\/144) and delirium or coma occurred in 76.4% (110\/144). Sixty-three percent of patients were positive for delirium on the first CAM-ICU assessment. The median duration of delirium and coma was 7 days (IQR: 3-10), and the median delirium duration was 5 days (IQR: 2-7). The median CAM-ICU-7 score was 6 (IQR: 4-7) representing severe delirium. Mechanical ventilation was associated with greater odds of developing delirium (OR: 42.1, 95%CI: 13.0-137.1). Mortality was 26.4% in patients with delirium compared to 15.8% in patients without delirium. Conclusions 73.6% of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 experience delirium that persists for approximately 1 week. Invasive mechanical ventilation is significantly associated with odds of delirium. Clinical attention to prevent and manage delirium and reduce delirium duration and severity is urgently needed for patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sikandar H Khan","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heidi Lindroth","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Perkins","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yasser Jamil","author_inst":"Lebanese American University"},{"author_name":"Sophia Wang","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark O Farber","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Omar Rahman","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sujuan Gao","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edward R Marcantonio","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Malaz Boustani","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Roberto Machado","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Babar A Khan","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marc Kanter","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Stuart Kessler","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Ross B Kristal","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Lieber","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Mukherjee","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Bellevue"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rizzo Jr.","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Queens"},{"author_name":"Madden Rowell","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"David Stevens","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Kings County"},{"author_name":"Elana Sydney","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Jacobi"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wallach","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dave A Chokshi","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nichola Davis","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"- New York City Health + Hospitals Covid-19 Population Health Data Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20118802","rel_title":"The Association Between Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers and the Number of Covid-19 Confirmed Cases and Deaths in the United States: Geospatial Study","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20118802","rel_abs":"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-Cov2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as an entry point to the cell. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a risk factor for the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with poor outcomes. We hypothesized that the rate of ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use is associated with the rate of Covid-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Methods: We conducted a geospatial study using publicly available county-level data. The Medicare ACEI and ARB prescription rate was exposure. The Covid-19 confirmed case and death rates were outcomes. Spatial autoregression models were adjusted for the percentage of Black residents, children, residents with at least some college degree, median household income, air quality index, CVD hospitalization rate in Medicare beneficiaries, and CVD death rate in a total county population. Findings: After adjustment for confounders, the ACEI use rate did not associate with Covid-19 confirmed case rate (direct county-own effect +0.11 %; 95%CI -0.31 to 0.53; P=0.600, and indirect spillover effect -0.53 %; 95%CI -3.89 to 2.84; P=0.760). The ARB use rate was associated with increased Covid-19 confirmed case rate (direct county-owned effect +0.12 %; 95%CI 0.05-0.19; P=0.002, and indirect spillover effect -0.33 %; 95%CI -2.11 to 1.44; P=0.714). Sensitivity analysis indicated an absence of significant reverse causality bias for analyses with Covid-19 confirmed case rate, but not death rate outcome. Interpretation: Our results highlight the safety of ACEI use for patients with clinical indications for ACEI use. However, an increase in ARB use by 1% was associated with a 0.12 % increase in Covid-19 confirmed cases. The use of ARB, due to known ACE2 upregulation, may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells and increase infectivity. Cluster-randomized controlled trial is warranted to answer the question of whether the replacement of ARB by ACEI may reduce the Covid-19 confirmed case rate.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyle Johnson","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Maedeh Khayyat-Kholghi","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Blake Johnson","author_inst":"Flexport, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Larisa G Tereshchenko","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Sophia Wang","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark O Farber","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Omar Rahman","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sujuan Gao","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edward R Marcantonio","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Malaz Boustani","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Roberto Machado","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Babar A Khan","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marc Kanter","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Stuart Kessler","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Ross B Kristal","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Lieber","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Mukherjee","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Bellevue"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rizzo Jr.","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Queens"},{"author_name":"Madden Rowell","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"David Stevens","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Kings County"},{"author_name":"Elana Sydney","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Jacobi"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wallach","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dave A Chokshi","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nichola Davis","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"- New York City Health + Hospitals Covid-19 Population Health Data Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20118695","rel_title":"ON THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HERD IMMUNITY LEVELS REQUIRED TO STOP COVID-19 EPIDEMICS","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20118695","rel_abs":"COVID-19 evolved into a pandemic in 2020 affecting more than 150 countries. Given the absence of a vaccine, discussion has taken place on the strategy of allowing the virus to spread in a population, to increase population \"herd immunity\". Knowledge of the minimum proportion of a population required to have recovered from COVID-19 infection in order to attain \"herd\" immunity, P(crit), is important for formulating epidemiological policy. A method for measuring uncertainty about P(crit) based on a widely used package, EpiEstim, is derived. The procedure is illustrated using data from twelve countries at two early times during the COVID-19 epidemic. It is shown that simple plug-in measures of confidence on estimates of P(crit) are misleading, but that a full characterization of statistical uncertainty can be derived from EpiEstim, which reports percentiles only.
