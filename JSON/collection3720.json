Methods: We used mobility data from a large, anonymized sample of smartphone users to assess the relationship between neighborhood median household income and physical distancing during the COVID-19 epidemic. We assessed changes in several behaviors including: spending the day entirely at home; working outside the home; and visits to supermarkets, parks, hospitals, and other locations. We also assessed differences in effects of state policies on physical distancing across neighborhood income levels. Results: We found a strong gradient between neighborhood income and physical distancing. Compared to January and February 2020, the proportion of individuals spending the day entirely at home in April 2020 increased by 10.9 percentage points in low-income neighborhoods and by 27.1 percentage points in high-income neighborhoods. During April 2020, people in low-income neighborhoods were more likely to work outside the home, compared to people in higher-income neighborhoods, but not more likely to visit non-work locations. State physical distancing orders were associated with a 1.5 percentage-point increase (95% CI [0.9, 2.1], p < 0.001) in staying home in low-income neighborhoods and a 2.4 percentage point increase (95% CI [1.4, 3.4], p < 0.001) in high-income neighborhoods. Discussion: People in lower-income neighborhoods have faced barriers to physical distancing, particularly the need to work outside the home. State physical distancing policies have not mitigated these disparities.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan Jay","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jacob Bor","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elaine Nsoesie","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Ketchen Lipson","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"David K Jones","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sandro Galea","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Julia Raifman","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.173567","rel_title":"Adhesive Contact Between Cylindrical (Ebola) and Spherical (SARS-CoV-2) Viral Particles and a Cell Membrane","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.173567","rel_abs":"A critical event during the process of cell infection by a viral particle is attachment, which is driven by adhesive interactions and resisted by bending and tension. The biophysics of this process has been studied extensively but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally been neglected. In this work we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say, representative of filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small and the mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied force. (The zero-external-force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The contact width at zero external force has a small value.) Our results for pull-off force and zero force contact width help to quantify conditions that could aid the development of therapies based on denying the virus entry into the cell by blocking its initial adhesion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiajun Wang","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Fortoul","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"X.

In human studies, CT prevented colds in healthy subjects and enhanced antibody production after influenza vaccination in elderly individuals with a poor nutritional status. The mechanism of action of CT is thought to be glutathione (GSH)-mediated regulation of intracellular redox, which might affect innate immune systems such as macrophages to exert physiological effects. The effect of CT on influenza is independent of viral type, and this treatment has a broad range of antiviral activities. To explore the mechanisms of CT in viral infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of spleen tissues isolated from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice. We identified unique gene signatures in response to CT in the IAV-infected mice. Genes upregulated by CT included redox-regulated genes such as GCLC\/GCLM (subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), TXN1, TXN2, TXNRD2, and SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular redox environment is substantially altered by CT. However, genes downregulated in response to CT included chemokine\/chemokine receptor genes (CCL5, CCL19, CXCL9, CXCL12, CXCR3, CXCR4, and ACKR3), some of which are related to cytokine storm. A comparison with public COVID-19-related gene set data showed that the upregulated gene signature was highly similar to the downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV\/SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and the upregulated gene set of attenuated SARS-CoV-infected cells. In conclusion, the unique gene signatures observed in response to orally administered CT in IAV-infected mouse spleen tissues suggested that CT may attenuate viral infection, replication and associated symptoms such as cytokine storm.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akira Mitsui","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Ryosei Sakai","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Kiyoshi Miwa","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Susumu Shibahara","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Shigekazu Kurihara","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Kenji Nagao","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Rafael Rahal Guaragna Machado","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, ICB, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Douglas Sales Medina","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, ICB, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Lara Kelly Ribeiro","author_inst":"Center for the Development of Functional Materials, CDMF, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ieda Lucia Viana Rosa","author_inst":"Center for the Development of Functional Materials, CDMF, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Assis","author_inst":"Center for the Development of Functional Materials, CDMF, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Juan Manuel Andres Bort","author_inst":"Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Department of Analytical and Physical Chemistry, University Jaume I, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elson Longo","author_inst":"Center for the Development of Functional Materials, CDMF, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Lucio H.

With little exception, each factor was predictive of incidence and mortality. The regression equation can be used to identify priority locations for preventive efforts and preparation for medical care caseloads when prevention is unsuccessful. Based on the correlation of cases and deaths to days since stay-at-home orders were issued, the orders reduced the cases about 48 percent and deaths about 50 percent.

Here, we have characterized and compared viral populations of SARS-CoV-2 among COVID-19 patients within and across households. Our work showed an active viral replication activity in the human respiratory tract and the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host. The inter-host comparison among viral populations further revealed a narrow transmission bottleneck between patients from the same households, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this study, we compared SARS-CoV-2 populations of 13 Chinese COVID-19 patients. Those viral populations contained a considerable proportion of viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNA), reflecting an active viral replication activity in the respiratory tract tissues. The comparison of 66 identified intra-host variants further showed a low viral genetic distance between intra-household patients and a narrow transmission bottleneck size. Despite the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host, most intra-host minor variants were not shared between transmission pairs, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions. Furthermore, the narrow bottleneck and active viral activity in the respiratory tract show that the passage of a small number of virions can cause infection. Our data have therefore delivered a key genomic resource for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission research and enhanced our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yanqun Wang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wanying Sun","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jingkai Ji","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhaoyong Zhang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Airu Zhu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.174193","rel_title":"A cytosine-to-uracil change within the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift signal of SARS-CoV-2 results in structural similarities with the MERS-CoV signal","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.174193","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, like many other viruses, uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) to enable synthesis of multiple proteins from its compact genome.

The conformationally dynamic S-protein is the primary immunogenic target of vaccine design owing to its role in host-cell fusion, displaying multiple receptor binding domain (RBD) \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 state configurations. Here, we investigated the potential for RBD adjacent, N-terminal domain (NTD) glycans to influence the conformational equilibrium of these RBD states. Using a combination of antigenic screens and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination, we show that an N-glycan deletion at position 234 results in a dramatically reduced population of the \u2018up\u2019 state RBD position. Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a discernable increase in \u2018up\u2019 state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element. Together, our results demonstrate this highly dynamic conformational machine is responsive to glycan modification with implications in viral escape and vaccine design.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rory Henderson","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Robert J Edwards","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Mansouri","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Janowska","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Stalls","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Megan Kopp","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Barton F Haynes","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Priyamvada Acharya","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Airu Zhu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20139048","rel_title":"A geotemporal survey of hospital bed saturation across England during the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20139048","rel_abs":"Background: Non-pharmacological interventions were introduced based on modelling studies which suggested that the English National Health Service (NHS) would be overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we describe the pattern of bed occupancy across England during the first wave of the pandemic, January 31st to June 5th 2020. Methods: Bed availability and occupancy data was extracted from daily reports submitted by all English secondary care providers, between 27-Mar and 5-June. Two thresholds (85% as per Royal College of Emergency Medicine and 92% as per NHS Improvement) were applied as thresholds for safe occupancy. Findings: At peak availability, there were 2711 additional beds compatible with mechanical ventilation across England, reflecting a 53% increase in capacity, and occupancy never exceeded 62%. A consequence of the repurposing of beds meant that at the trough, there were 8.7% (8,508) fewer general and acute (G&A) beds across England, but occupancy never exceeded 72%. The closest to (surge) capacity that any trust in England reached was 99.8% for general and acute beds. For beds compatible with mechanical ventilation there were 326 trust-days (3.7%) spent above 85% of surge capacity, and 154 trust-days (1.8%) spent above 92%. 23 trusts spent a cumulative 81 days at 100% saturation of their surge ventilator bed capacity (median number of days per trust = 1 [range: 1 to 17]). However, only 3 STPs (aggregates of geographically co-located trusts) reached 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilation beds. Interpretation: Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, an adequate supply of all bed-types existed at a national level. Due to an unequal distribution of bed utilization, many trusts spent a significant period operating above safe occupancy thresholds, despite substantial capacity in geographically co-located trusts; a key operational issue to address in preparing for a potential second wave. Funding: This study received no funding.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bilal A Mateen","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute; University of Warwick; Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Harrison Wilde","author_inst":"University of Warwick, Department of Statistics"},{"author_name":"John m Dennis","author_inst":"University of Exeter Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andrew Duncan","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute; Imperial College London, Faculty of Natural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nicholas John Meyrick Thomas","author_inst":"University of Exeter Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andrew P McGovern","author_inst":"Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, Diabetes and Endocrinology; University of Exeter Medical School"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Sebastian J Vollmer","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute; University of Warwick, Department of Statistics"},{"author_name":"Airu Zhu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20138941","rel_title":"Co-occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 and Respiratory Pathogens in the Frail Elderly","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20138941","rel_abs":"Background: Elderly SARS-CoV-2 patients are associated with higher hospitalization and mortality. Co-infection is critical in the severity of respiratory diseases. It is largely understudied for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Between March 24th and April 27th, 2020, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from 3,348 patients from nursing homes and assisted living facilities in 22 states in the US were tested by Capstone Healthcare for SARS-CoV-2, 24 other respiratory viruses, and 8 respiratory bacteria. Total nucleic acid was extracted with MagMAXTM Viral\/Pathogen Ultra nucleic acid isolation kit. SARS-Co-V-2 was detected with the CDC 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) diagnostic panel. Total nucleic acid was pre-amplified before analysis for other respiratory pathogens with Taqman OpenArrayTM Respiratory Tract Microbiota Plate. Results: Patients mean age was 76.9 years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 1,413 patients (42.2%). Among them, 1,082 (76.6%) and 737 (43.7%) patients were detected with at least one bacterium or another virus, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were more likely to have bacterial co-occurrences (76.6%) than SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (70.0%) (p<0.0001). The most common co-occurring bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumonia, detected in 55.8% and 40.1% SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was associated with SARS-CoV-2, with higher detection rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (55.8%) than SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (46.2%) (p<0.0001). Human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) also was common and associated with SARS-CoV-2, with higher detection rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (26.6%) than SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (19.1%) (p<0.0001). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients are more likely to be positive for certain respiratory bacteria and viruses. This observation may help explain high hospitalization and mortality rates in older patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Baunoch","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Alan Wolfe","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dakun Wang","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Ryan Gnewuch","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Zhao","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Thomas Halverson","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Cacdac","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Shuguang Huang","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Trisha Lauterbach","author_inst":"Capstone Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Natalie Luke","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20138982","rel_title":"Modeling the Covid-19 Pandemic Response of the US States","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20138982","rel_abs":"Background: The United States of America (USA) has been the country worst affected, in absolute terms, by the Covid-19 pandemic. The country comprises 50 states under a federal system. The impact of the pandemic has resulted in different responses at the state level, which are driven by differing intervention policies, demographics, connectedness and other factors. Understanding the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic at the state level is essential in predicting its future evolution. Objective: Our objective is to identify and characterize multiple waves of the pandemic by analyzing the reported infected population curve in each of the 50 US states. Based on the intensity of the waves, characterized by declining, stationary, or increasing strengths, each state's response can be inferred and quantified. Methods: We apply a recently proposed multiple-wave model to fit the infected population data for each state in USA, and use the proposed Pandemic Response Index to quantify their response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: We have analyzed reported infected cases from each one of the 50 USA states and the District of Columbia, based on the multiple-wave model, and present the relevant parameters. Multiple waves have been identified and this model is found to describe the data better. Each of the states can be classified into one of three distinct classes characterized by declining, increasing, or stationary strength of the waves following the initial one. The effectiveness of intervention measures can be inferred by the peak intensities of the waves, and states with similar population characteristics can be directly compared. We estimate how much lower the number of infections might have been, if early and strict intervention measures had been imposed to stop the disease spread at the first wave, as was the case for certain states. Based on our model's results, we compute the value of the Pandemic Response Index, a recently introduced metric for quantifying in an objective manner the response to the pandemic. Conclusions: Our results reveal a series of epidemic waves, characterizing USA's pandemic response at the state level, and also infer to what extent the imposition of early intervention measures could have had on the spread and impact of the disease. As of June 11, 2020, only 19 states and the District of Columbia (40% of the total) clearly exhibit declining trends in the numbers of reported infected cases, while 13 states exhibit stationary and 18 states increasing trends in the numbers of reported cases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Georgios Neofotistos","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS),  John A.

Deaths in both Sweden and England and Wales peaked on 8 April. The build up to the peak was very similar in both.

As expected, only a rigorous program of testing, tracing and isolation of cases will allow the state to ease its lockdown with a reduced number of deaths. We also find that a slightly earlier date of lockdown, while reducing the number of deaths in the short term, will only reduce the total number of deaths in the long run if the ensuing strategies in easing the lockdown are carried out with the aforementioned test, trace and isolation program.

To lessen the global health consequences of COVID-19, sweeping COVID-19 lockdown and quarantine measures have been imposed within many nations. These measures have significantly impacted the world's economy and in many cases has led to the loss of livelihood. Mathematical modeling of pandemics is of critical importance to understand the unfolding of transmission events and to formulate control measures.

We then take advantage of electoral turnout differences between departements to distinguish the impact of the election on prediction errors in hospitalizations from that of simultaneously implemented anti-contagion policies. We report a detrimental effect of the election in locations that were at relatively advanced stages of the epidemics by the time of the election. In contrast, we show that the election did not contribute to the epidemics in departements with lower infection levels by March 15.

The global impact of COVID-19 has resulted in a surge of related research. Researchers have turned to social media platforms, namely Twitter, to disseminate their articles. The online database Altmetric is a tool which tracks the social media metrics of articles and is complementary to traditional, citation-based metrics. Citation-based metrics may fail to portray dissemination accurately, due to the lengthy publication process. Altmetrics are not subject to this time-lag, suggesting that they may be an effective marker of research dissemination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: To assess the dissemination of COVID-19 articles as measured by Twitter dissemination, compared to traditional citation-based metrics, and determine article characteristics associated with tweet rates. Methods: COVID-19 articles obtained from LitCovid published between January 1st to March 18th, 2020 were screened for inclusion. The following article characteristics were extracted independently, in single: Topic (General Info, Mechanism, Diagnosis, Transmission, Treatment, Prevention, Case Report, and Epidemic Forecasting), open access status (open access and subscription-based), continent of corresponding author (Asia, Australia, Africa, North America, South America, and Europe), tweets, and citations. A sign test was used to compare the tweet rate and citation rate per day. A negative binomial regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between tweet rate and article characteristics of interest. Results: 1328 articles were included in the analysis. Tweet rates were found to be significantly higher than citation rates for COVID-19 articles, with a median tweet rate of 1.09 (IQR 6.83) tweets per day and median citation rate of 0.00 (IQR 0.00) citations per day, resulting in a median of differences of 1.09 (95% CI 0.86-1.33, P < .001). 2018 journal impact factors were positively correlated with tweet rate (P < .001). The topics Diagnosis (P = .01), Transmission (P < .001), Treatment (P = .01), and Epidemic Forecasting (P < .001) were positively correlated with tweet rate, relative to Case Report. The following continents of the corresponding author were negatively correlated with tweet rate, Africa (P < .001), Australia (P = .03), and South America (P < .001), relative to Asia. Open access journals were negatively correlated with tweet rate, relative to subscription-based journals (P < .001). Conclusions: COVID-19 articles had significantly higher tweets rates compared to citation rates. This study further identified article characteristics that are correlated with the dissemination of articles on Twitter, such as 2018 journal impact factor, continent of the corresponding author, topic, and open access status. This highlights the importance of altmetrics in periods of rapidly expanding research, such as the COVID-19 pandemic to localize highly disseminated articles.

Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the re-opening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust surveillance, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to detect, followed by an exponential viral growth, leading to a peak viral load and infectiousness, and ending with declining viral levels and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model surveillance effectiveness considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective surveillance depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that surveillance should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel B Larremore","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Bryan Wilder","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Evan Lester","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Soraya Shehata","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"James M Burke","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"James A Hay","author_inst":"Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Milind Tambe","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mina","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Roy Parker","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Natalie Luke","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20139006","rel_title":"Evaluation of two commercial and two non-commercial immunoassays for the detection of prior infection to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20139006","rel_abs":"Background Seroepidemiology is an important tool to characterize the epidemiology and immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 but many immunoassays have not been externally validated raising questions about reliability of study findings. To ensure meaningful data, particularly in a low seroprevalence population, assays need to be rigorously characterized with high specificity. Methods We evaluated two commercial (Roche Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics IgM\/IgG) and two non-commercial (Simoa and Ragon\/MGH IgG) immunoassays against 68 confirmed positive and 232 pre-pandemic negative controls. Sensitivity was stratified by time from symptom onset. The Simoa multiplex assay applied three pre-defined algorithm models to determine sample result. Results The Roche and Ragon\/MGH IgG assays each registered 1\/232 false positive, the primary Simoa model registered 2\/232 false positives, and the Epitope registered 2\/230 and 3\/230 false positives for the IgG and IgM assays respectively. Sensitivity >21 days post symptom-onset was 100% for all assays except Epitope IgM, but lower and\/or with greater variability between assays for samples collected 9-14 days (67-100%) and 15-21 days (69-100%) post-symptom onset. The Simoa and Epitope IgG assays demonstrated excellent sensitivity earlier in the disease course. The Roche and Ragon\/MGH IgG assays were less sensitive during early disease, particularly among immunosuppressed individuals. Conclusions The Epitope IgG demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity. The Roche and Ragon\/MGH IgG assays registered rare false positives with lower early sensitivity. The Simoa assay primary model had excellent sensitivity and few false positives.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric J.

The mechanisms by which this viral infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. In this brief report, we present data indicating that stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells by AngII leads to increased expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for the synthesis of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE). We suggest that increased expression of these chondroitin sulfotransferases and the ensuing production of chondroitin sulfates may contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to the progression of respiratory disease in Covid-19. The enzyme Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase), which removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate residues, is required for degradation of C4S and CSE. In hypoxic conditions or following treatment with chloroquine, ARSB activity is reduced. Decline in ARSB can contribute to ongoing accumulation and airway obstruction by C4S and CSE. Decline in ARSB leads to increased expression of Interleukin(IL)-6 in human bronchial epithelial cells, and IL-6 is associated with cytokine storm in Covid-19. These findings indicate how chondroitin sulfates, chondroitin sulfotransferases, and chondroitin sulfatases may participate in the progression of hypoxic respiratory insufficiency in Covid-19 disease and suggest new therapeutic targets.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sumit Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago and Jesse Brown VAMC"},{"author_name":"Kumar Kotlo","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago and Jesse Brown VAMC"},{"author_name":"Joanne Kramer Tobacman","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago and Jesse Brown VAMC"},{"author_name":"Tal Gilboa","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital & Harvard medical school"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Fischinger","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Guohai Zhou","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christopher L.

A better molecular understanding of COVID-19 in people with type diabetes mellitus (T2D) is mandatory, especially in countries with a high rate of T2D, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make T2D patients prone to aggressive course of the disease can help in the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve our response to the disease pandemic. Herein, we employed a system genetics approach to explore potential genomic, transcriptomic alterations in genes specific to lung and pancreas tissues, affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and study their association with susceptibility to T2D in Emirati patients. Our results identified the Exocyst complex component, 6 (EXOC6\/6B) gene (a component for docks insulin granules to the plasma membrane) with documented INDEL in 3 of 4 whole genome sequenced Emirati diabetic patients. Publically available transcriptomic data showed that lung infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed significantly lower expression of EXOC6\/6B compared to healthy lungs.\n\nIn conclusion, our data suggest that EXOC6\/6B might be an important molecular link between dysfunctional pancreatic islets and ciliated lung epithelium that makes diabetic patients more susceptible to severe SARS-COV-2 complication.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jalal Taneera","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Mahmood Yaseen Hachim","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Yaseen Hachim","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Saba Al Heialy","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sulaiman","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Guohai Zhou","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christopher L.

The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern therefore several scientists are dedicated to the study of the new virus. Since human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on host cell machinery for replication and co-evolution, we selected the genes that are highly expressed in the tissue of human lungs to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. In our studies, we analysed 91 molecular features for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677873 codon positions. Hereby, we found that A\/T bias in viral genes could propitiate the viral infection favoured by a host dependant specialization using the host cell machinery of only some genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could have been further benefited by a high rate of A\/T in the third codon position. Thereby, the mistranslation or de-regulation of protein synthesis could produce collateral effects, as a consequence of viral occupancy of the host translation machinery due tomolecular similarities with viral genes. Furthermore, we provided a list of candidate human genes whose molecular features match those of SARS-CoV-2, SARSand MERS genes, which should be considered to be incorporated into genetic population studies to evaluate thesusceptibility to respiratory viral infections caused by these viruses. The results presented here, settle the basis for further research in the field of human genetics associated with the new viral infection, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 and for the development of antiviral preventive methods.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Maldonado Sr.","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiologia y Parasitologia Medica IMPAM-UBA-CONICET"},{"author_name":"Laura Kamenetzky","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiologia y Parasitologia Medica IMPAM-UBA-CONICET"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Yaseen Hachim","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Saba Al Heialy","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sulaiman","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Guohai Zhou","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christopher L.

Identifying changes in viral genomes provides key insights into viral diversity, how viruses spread within populations, and viral strategies for evasion of host immune systems. Here we report twenty-five SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected from some of the first COVID-19 cases in eastern Ontario, Canada (March 18-30, 2020). The reported genomes belong to the S-clade (n=2) and G-clade (n=23) of SARS-CoV-2 and contain 45 polymorphic sites including one shared missense and three unique synonymous variants in the gene encoding the spike protein. A phylogenetic analysis enabled the tracing of viral origin and potential transmission into and within Canada. There may be as many as sixteen unique infection events represented in these samples, including at least three that were likely introduced from Europe and seven from the USA. In addition, four separate genomes are each shared by multiple patients, suggesting a common origin or community spread even during this early stage of infection. These results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like SARS-CoV-2. Earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to prevent future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Maldonado Sr.","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiologia y Parasitologia Medica IMPAM-UBA-CONICET"},{"author_name":"Laura Kamenetzky","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiologia y Parasitologia Medica IMPAM-UBA-CONICET"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Yaseen Hachim","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Saba Al Heialy","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sulaiman","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Guohai Zhou","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christopher L.

Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies. Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus, identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials. Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells. Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR\/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.\n\nDisclosuresNone declared.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gustavo Garcia Jr.","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Arun Sharma","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arunachalam Ramaiah","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Chandani Sen","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Donald Kohn","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Gomperts","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Clive N Svendsen","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Robert D Damoiseaux","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Karina Oganezova","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"David R.

Four structural proteins, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) glycoprotein, play a key role in controlling the entry into human cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2. However, how these genes evolve during its human to human transmission is largely unknown. In this study, we screened and analyzed roughly 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from GenBank database. The distribution of the four gene alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades based on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination event isnt detected among different alleles. However, purifying selection has conducted on the evolution of these genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8, M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure and a persistent D614G mutation is identified. The definitive positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy package. In addition, another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of the S protein is also identified. The allele containing D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability of isolates with the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural modeling shows that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of salt bridge among S protein monomers increase their flexibility, and in turn promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, virus attachment and entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein as it is, L5F mutation may facilitate the protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. This is the first evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to a better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this virus and help to provide insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches as well as effective vaccines by targeting on mutation sites.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Zhan","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xuefu Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ke Huang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Qian","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yang Leng","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Leping Yan","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Bihui Huang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yulong He","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Karina Oganezova","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"David R.
