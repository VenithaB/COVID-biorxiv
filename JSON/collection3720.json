This process requires a single host to be infected with more than one type of coronavirus, which recombine to form novel strains of virus with unique combinations of genetic material. Identifying possible sources of novel coronaviruses requires identifying hosts (termed recombination hosts) of more than one coronavirus type, in which recombination might occur. However, the majority of coronavirus-host interactions remain unknown, and therefore the vast majority of recombination hosts for coronaviruses cannot be identified. Here we show that there are 11.5-fold more coronavirus-host associations, and over 30-fold more potential SARS-CoV-2 recombination hosts, than have been observed to date. We show there are over 40-fold more host species with four or more different subgenera of coronaviruses. This underestimation of both number and novel coronavirus generation in wild and domesticated animals. Our results list specific high-risk hosts in which our model predicts homologous recombination could occur, our model identifies both wild and domesticated mammals including known important and understudied species. We recommend these species for coronavirus surveillance, as well as enforced separation in livestock markets and agriculture.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maya Wardeh","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Matthew Baylis","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marcus SC Blagrove","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.153817","rel_title":"The IMEx Coronavirus interactome: an evolving map of Coronaviridae-Host molecular interactions","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.153817","rel_abs":"The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spurred a wave of research of nearly unprecedented scale.

With no vaccines, and only recently developed antiviral therapeutics, we are ill equipped to handle coronavirus outbreaks4. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate coronavirus replication and pathogenesis is needed to guide the development of new antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. RNA secondary structures play critical roles in multiple aspects of coronavirus replication, but the extent and conservation of RNA secondary structure across coronavirus genomes is unknown5. Here, we define highly structured RNA regions throughout the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We find that highly stable RNA structures are pervasive throughout coronavirus genomes, and are conserved between the SARS-like CoV. Our data suggests that selective pressure helps preserve RNA secondary structure in coronavirus genomes, suggesting that these structures may play important roles in virus replication and pathogenesis. Thus, disruption of conserved RNA secondary structures could be a novel strategy for the generation of attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wes Sanders","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ethan J Fritch","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Emily A Madden","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Rachel L Graham","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Heather A Vincent","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark T Heise","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Nathaniel J Moorman","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kalpana Panneerselvam","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Simona Panni","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Ecology and Earth Sciences, Universita della Calabria, Rende, Italy"},{"author_name":"Negin Rahimzadeh","author_inst":"UCLA-DOE Institute, UCLA, Los Angeles, USA.

Although clinically approved drugs have been repurposed to treat individuals with 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the lack of safety studies and limited efficiency as well jeopardize clinical benefits. Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir (SFV) are clinically approved direct-acting antivirals (DAA) against hepatitis C virus (HCV), with satisfactory safety profile. In the HCV replicative cycle, daclatasvir and SFV target the viral enzymes NS5A and NS5B, respectively. NS5A is endowed with pleotropic activities, which overlap with several proteins from SARS-CoV-2. HCV NS5B and SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 are RNA polymerases that share homology in the nucleotide uptake channel. These characteristics of the HCV and SARS-CoV-2 motivated us to further study the activity of daclatasvir and SFV against the new coronavirus. Daclatasvir consistently inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in Vero cells, in the hepatoma cell line HuH-7 and in type II pneumocytes (Calu-3), with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 M, respectively. Daclatasvir targeted early events during SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and prevented the induction of IL-6 and TNF-, inflammatory mediators associated with the cytokine storm typical of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sofosbuvir, although inactive in Vero cells, displayed EC50 values of 6.2 and 9.5 M in HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells, respectively. Our data point to additional antiviral candidates, in especial daclatasvir, among drugs overlooked for COVID-19, that could immediately enter clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carolina Q.

Currently, the knowledge accumulated from different studies about this virus is very limited. Leveraging a wide-range of biological knowledge, such as gene on-tology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can accurately identify PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable insights for advancing research on this new disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junheng Hao","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chelsea Jui-Ting Ju","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Muhao Chen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Yizhou Sun","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Carlo Zaniolo","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Camila R.

From nearly 12,000 compounds, we identified 66 compounds capable of selectively inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Twenty-four of these drugs show additive activity in combination with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir and may afford increased in vivo efficacy. We also identified synergistic interaction of the nucleoside analog riboprine and a folate antagonist 10-deazaaminopterin with remdesivir. Overall, seven clinically approved drugs (halofantrine, amiodarone, nelfinavir, simeprevir, manidipine, ozanimod, osimertinib) and 19 compounds in other stages of development may have the potential to be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 oral therapeutics based on their potency, pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malina A.

However, the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet been investigated. The initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium (OE) mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by supporting cells known as sustentacular cells. The olfactory neurons project their axons to the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier. In the present study, we explored the impact of SARS-COV-2 infection on the olfactory system in golden Syrian hamsters. We observed massive damage of the OE as early as 2 days post nasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection. These damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not of olfactory neurons, and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs. We observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria of infected animals, which may contribute to the desquamation of the OE. The OE was partially restored 14 days post infection. Anosmia observed in COVID-19 patient is therefore likely to be linked to a massive and fast desquamation of the OE following sustentacular cells infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent recruitment of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bertrand Bryche","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, INRAE, UVSQ, VIM, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France"},{"author_name":"Audrey Saint-Albin Deliot","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, INRAE, UVSQ, VIM, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France"},{"author_name":"Severine Murri","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Lyon, ANSES, Unite virologie, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Sandra Lacote","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Lyon, ANSES, Unite virologie, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Coralie Pulido","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Lyon, ANSES, Unite virologie, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Meriadeg Ar Gouilh","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, CHU de Caen, Caen, France"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Lesellier","author_inst":"Laboratoire rage et faune sauvage, ANSES, Malzeville, France"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Servat","author_inst":"Laboratoire rage et faune sauvage, ANSES, Malzeville, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Wasniewski","author_inst":"Laboratoire rage et faune sauvage, ANSES, Malzeville, France"},{"author_name":"Evelyne Picard-Meyer","author_inst":"Laboratoire rage et faune sauvage, ANSES, Malzeville, France"},{"author_name":"Elodie Montchartre-Leroy","author_inst":"Laboratoire rage et faune sauvage, ANSES, Malzeville, France"},{"author_name":"Romain Volmer","author_inst":"Universite de Toulouse, ENVT, INRA, UMR 1225, Toulouse, France"},{"author_name":"Olivier Rampin","author_inst":"Universite Paris Saclay, INRAE, AgroParisTech, PNCA, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France"},{"author_name":"Ronan Le Goffic","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, INRAE, UVSQ, VIM, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France"},{"author_name":"Philippe Marianneau","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Lyon, ANSES, Unite virologie, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Meunier","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, INRAE, UVSQ, VIM, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France"},{"author_name":"Sandra Orchard","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Igor Jurisica","author_inst":"Krembil Research Institute, Data Science Discovery Centre for Chronic Diseases, University Health Network, 5KD-407, 60 Leonard Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5T 0S8, Can"},{"author_name":"Henning Hermjakob","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Pablo Porras","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"neuroscience"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.154211","rel_title":"TMPRSS2, a SARS-CoV-2 internalization protease is downregulated in head and neck cancer patients.","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.154211","rel_abs":"ObjectivesTwo of the main target tissues of SARS-coronavirus 2 are the oral cavity pharynx-larynx epithelium, the main virus entry site, and the lung epithelium. The virus enters host cells through binding of the Spike protein to ACE2 receptor and subsequent S priming by the TMPRSS2 protease. Herein we aim to assess differences in both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in normal tissues from oral cavity-pharynx-larynx and lung tissues as well as neoplastic tissues from the same histological areas. The information provided in this study may contribute to better understanding of SARS-coronavirus 2 ability to interact with different biological systems and contributes to cumulative knowledge on potential mechanisms to inhibit its diffusion.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe study has been conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Regina Elena Institute (IRE) databases and validated by experimental model in HNSCC and Lung cancer cells. Data from one COVID19 positive patient who was operated on for HNSCC was also included. We have analyzed 478 tumor samples and 44 normal samples from TCGA HNSCC cohort for whom both miRNA and mRNA sequencing was available. The dataset included 391 HPV- and 85 HPV+ cases, with 331 P53 mutated and 147 P53 wild type cases respectively. 352 out of 478 samples were male and 126 female. In IRE cohort we analyzed 66 tumor samples with matched normal sample for miRNA profiling and 23 tumor\\normal matched samples for mRNA profiling. 45 out of 66 tumors from IRE cohort were male and 21 female, 38 were P53 mutated and 27 wild type. Most patients (63 of 66) in IRE cohort were HPV negative. Normalized TCGA HNSCC gene expression and miRNA expression data were obtained from Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis Center (http:\/\/gdac.broadinstitute.org\/). mRNA expression data from IRE cohort used in this study has been deposited to NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO series accession number GSE107591. In order to inference about potential molecular modulation of TMPRSS2, we also included miRNAs expression for the 66 IRE cohort matched tumor and normal samples from Agilent platform. DNA methylation data for TCGA tumors were obtained from Wanderer (http:\/\/maplab.imppc.org\/wanderer\/). We used miRWalk and miRNet web tools for miRNA-target interaction prediction and pathway enrichment analysis. The correlation and regression analyses as well as the miRNA and gene modulation and the survival analysis were conducted using Matlab R2019.\n\nResultsTMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC was significantly reduced compared to the normal tissues and had a prognostic value in HNSCC patients. Reduction of TMPRSS2 expression was more evident in women than in men, in TP53 mutated versus wild TP53 tumors as well as in HPV negative patients compared to HPV positive counterparts. Functionally, we assessed the multivariate effect on TMPRSS2 in a single regression model. We observed that all variables had an independent effect on TMPRSS2 in HNSCC patients with HPV negative, TP53 mutated status and with elevated TP53-dependent Myc-target genes associated with low TMPRSS2 expression. Investigation of the molecular modulation of TMPRSS2 in both HNSCC and lung cancers revealed that expression of microRNAs targeting TMPRSS2 anti-correlated in both TCGA and IRE HNSCC datasets, while there was not evidence of TMPRSS2 promoter methylation in both tumor cohorts. Interestingly, the anti-correlation between microRNAs and TMPRSS2 expression was corroborated by testing this association in a SARS-CoV-2 positive HNSCC patient.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, these findings suggest that tumoral tissues, herein exemplified by HNSCC and lung cancers might be more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2. The protective mechanism might occur, at least partially, through the aberrant activation of TMPRSS2 targeting microRNAs; thereby providing strong evidence on the role of non-coding RNA molecule in host viral infection. These observations may help to better assess the frailty of SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Sacconi","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sara Donzelli","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pulito","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ferrero","author_inst":"University of Milan La Statale"},{"author_name":"Aldo Morrone","author_inst":"San Gallicano Dermatological Institute IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Marta Rigoni","author_inst":"University of Trento"},{"author_name":"Fulvia Pimipinelli","author_inst":"San Gallicano Dermatologic Institute IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Ensoli","author_inst":"San Gallicano Dermatologic Institute IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Sanguineti","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Raul Pellini","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Nishant Agrawal","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine and Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Evgeny Izumchenko","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine and Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gennaro Ciliberto","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Aldo Gianni","author_inst":"University of Milan La Statale"},{"author_name":"Paola Muti","author_inst":"University of Milan La Statale"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Strano","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Blandino","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Igor Jurisica","author_inst":"Krembil Research Institute, Data Science Discovery Centre for Chronic Diseases, University Health Network, 5KD-407, 60 Leonard Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5T 0S8, Can"},{"author_name":"Henning Hermjakob","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Pablo Porras","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"cancer biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.154658","rel_title":"Lack of susceptibility of poultry to SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.154658","rel_abs":"Chickens, turkeys, ducks, quail and geese were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV.

We identified timescales for alterations in mitochondrial activity, signaling and transcription regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems and their relationship to viral titer. At the individual-gene level, EGR3 was significantly upregulated in infected cells. Similar activation in T-cells and fibroblasts in infected lung could explain the T-cell anergy and eventual fibrosis seen in SARS-CoV-1 infection.

Drug repurposing is one of the most rapid strategies for addressing this need and numerous compounds have been selected for in vitro testing by several groups already. These have led to a growing database of molecules with in vitro activity against the virus. Machine learning models can assist drug discovery through prediction of the best compounds based on previously published data. Herein we have implemented several machine learning methods to develop predictive models from recent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro inhibition data and used them to prioritize additional FDA approved compounds for in vitro testing selected from our in-house compound library. From the compounds predicted with a Bayesian machine learning model, CPI1062 and CPI1155 showed antiviral activity in HeLa-ACE2 cell-based assays and represent potential repurposing opportunities for COVID-19.

While research to deliver vaccines and antivirals are being pursued, various effective technologies to control its environmental spread are also being targeted. Ultraviolet light (UV-C) technologies are effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms when used even on large surface areas. In this study, we developed a pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency based genomic model to predict the sensitivity of select enveloped and non-enveloped viruses to UV-C treatments in order to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 and human noroviruses surrogates. The results revealed that this model was best fitted using linear regression with r2=0.90. The predicted UV-C sensitivity (D90 - dose for 90% inactivation) for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was found to be 21 and 28 J\/m2, respectively (with an estimated 18 J\/m2 as published for SARS-CoV-1), suggesting that coronaviruses are highly sensitive to UV-C light compared to other ssRNA viruses used in this modeling study. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain with a D90 of 21 J\/m2 close to that of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a suitable surrogate to validate SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by UV-C treatment. Furthermore, the non-enveloped human noroviruses (HuNoVs), had predicted D90 values of 69.1, 89 and 77.6 J\/m2 for genogroups GI, GII and GIV, respectively. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) of GV with a D90 = 100 J\/m2 was identified as a potential conservative surrogate for UV-C inactivation of these HuNoVs. This study provides useful insights for the identification of potential nonpathogenic surrogates to understand inactivation kinetics and their use in experimental validation of UV-C disinfection systems. This approach can be used to narrow the number of surrogates used in testing UV-C inactivation of other human and animal ssRNA viral pathogens for experimental validation that can save cost, labor and time.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brahmaiah Pendyala","author_inst":"Tennessee State University"},{"author_name":"Ankit Patras","author_inst":"Tennessee State University"},{"author_name":"Doris DSouza","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Jean Bernatchez","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Sungjun Beck","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Nathan Beutler","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"James Ricketts","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Linlin Yang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Ana C Puhl","author_inst":"Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kimberley M Zorn","author_inst":"Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Thomas R Lane","author_inst":"Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc."},{"author_name":"Andre S Godoy","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Glaucius Olivia","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jair L Siqueira-Neto","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Peter Madrid","author_inst":"SRI International"},{"author_name":"Sean Ekins","author_inst":"Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Igor Jurisica","author_inst":"Krembil Research Institute, Data Science Discovery Centre for Chronic Diseases, University Health Network, 5KD-407, 60 Leonard Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5T 0S8, Can"},{"author_name":"Henning Hermjakob","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Pablo Porras","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.154286","rel_title":"Comparing library preparation methods for SARS-CoV-2 multiplex amplicon sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.154286","rel_abs":"Genomic surveillance has a key role in tracking the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but information on how different sequencing library preparation approaches affect the data produced are lacking.

We show that all three library preparation methods allow us to recover near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes with identical SNP calls. The Nextera Flex and KAPA library preparation methods gave better coverage than libraries prepared with Nextera XT, which required more reads to call the same number of genomic positions. The KAPA ligation-based approach shows the lowest levels of human contamination, but contaminating reads had no effect on the downstream analysis. We found some examples of library preparation-specific differences in minority variant calling. Overall our data shows that the choice of Illumina library preparation method has minimal effects on consensus base calling and downstream phylogenetic analysis, and suggests that all methods would be suitable for use if specific reagents are difficult to obtain.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Batty","author_inst":"Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand and Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global "},{"author_name":"Theerarat Kochakarn","author_inst":"Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine Unit (GEM), Center of Excellence in Malaria Research, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand and"},{"author_name":"Arporn Wangwiwatsin","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Khajohn Joonlasak","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Angkana T.

Methods: In this retrospective study, 1,206 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and followed-up by telephone call one month after discharged from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, symptoms, and numerical rating scale scores (0-10) of nasal symptoms were extracted from the hospital medical records, and confirmed or reevaluated by the telephone follow-up. Results: From COVID-19 patients (N = 1,172) completing follow-up, 199 (17%) subjects had severe COVID-19 and 342 (29.2%) reported nasal symptoms. The most common nasal symptom was loss of taste (20.6%, median score = 6), while 11.4% had loss of smell (median score = 5). The incidence of nasal symptom including loss of smell and loss of taste as the first onset symptom was <1% in COVID-19 patients. Loss of smell or taste scores showed no correlation with the scores of other nasal symptoms. Loss of taste scores, but not loss of smell scores, were significantly increased in severe vs. non-severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin (IL)-6 and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels positively correlated with loss of taste scores. About 80% of COVID-19 patients recovered from smell and taste dysfunction in 2 weeks. Conclusion: In the Wuhan COVID-19 cohort, only 1 out of 10 hospital admitted patients had loss of smell while 1 out 5 reported loss of taste which was associated to severity of COVID-19. Most patients recovered smell and taste dysfunctions in 2 weeks.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Song","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ke Deng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hai Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Chao Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Liao","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jin Ma","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chao He","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Li Pan","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Isam Alobid","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERES"},{"author_name":"De-Yun Wang","author_inst":"Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ming Zeng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Mullol","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERES"},{"author_name":"Zheng Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Insee Sensorn","author_inst":"Center for Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Somnuek Sungkanuparph","author_inst":"Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Samut Prakan, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Ekawat Pasomsub","author_inst":"Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Chonticha Klungthong","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Thanat Chookajorn","author_inst":"Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine Unit (GEM), Center of Excellence in Malaria Research, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Wasun Chantratita","author_inst":"Center for Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"otolaryngology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129981","rel_title":"A discrete-time-evolution model to forecast progress of Covid-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-06-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129981","rel_abs":"Based on well-known infection models, we constructed a new model to forecast the propagation of the Covid-19 pandemic which yields a discrete-time evolution with one day interval.

It has only two adjustable parameters and is able to predict the evolution of the total number of infected people in a country for the next 14 days, if parameters do not change during this time. The model incorporates the main aspects of the disease such as the the fact that there are asymptomatic and symptomatic phases (both capable of propagating the virus), and that these phases take almost two weeks before the infected person status evolves to the next (asymptomatic becomes symptomatic or symptomatic becomes either recovered or dead). One advantage of the model is that it gives directly the number of total infected people in each day (in thousands, tens of thousands or hundred of thousands). The model was tested with data from Brazil, UK and South Korea, it predicts quite well the evolution of the disease and therefore may be an useful tool to estimate the propagation of the disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Evaldo M.

To overcome this, we constructed an ACE2-human IgG1 fusion protein with mutations in the catalytic domain of ACE2. This fusion protein contained a LALA mutation that abrogates Fcr{gamma} binding, but retains FcRN binding to prolong the half-life, as well as achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lung lavage. Interestingly, a mutation in the catalytic domain of ACE2, MDR504, completely abrogated catalytic activity, but significantly increased binding to SARS-CoV2 spike protein in vitro. This feature correlated with more potent viral neutralization in a plaque assay. Parental administration of the protein showed stable serum concentrations with a serum half-life of [~] 145 hours with excellent bioavailability in the epithelial lining fluid of the lung. Prophylactic administration of MDR504 significantly attenuated SARS-CoV2 infection in a murine model.

This may be due in large part to the unclear immunopathological basis for the development of immune dysregulation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe and critical patients. Specifically, it remains unknown whether the immunological features of the disease that have been identified so far are compartment-specific responses or general features of COVID-19. Additionally, readily detectable biological markers correlated with strata of disease severity that could be used to triage patients and inform treatment options have not yet been identified. Here, we leveraged publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to elucidate the common and compartment-specific immunological features of clinically severe COVID-19. We identified a number of transcriptional programs that are altered across the spectrum of disease severity, few of which are common between the lung and peripheral immune environments. In the lung, comparing severe and moderate patients revealed severity-specific responses of enhanced interferon, A20\/I{kappa}B, IL-2, and IL-6 pathway signatures along with broad signaling activity of IFNG, SPP1, CCL3, CCL8, and IL18 across cell types. These signatures contrasted with features unique to ARDS observed in the blood compartment, which included depletion of interferon and A20\/I{kappa}B signatures and a lack of IL-6 response.

The development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology. Several techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established, mainly based on counting infected cells by staining plaques or foci, or by quantifying the viral genome by PCR. These methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format, regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. determine TCID50 of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC50 values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera. Thus, the in-cell spike ELISA represents a promising alternative to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition and may facilitate future research.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDetermination of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzymatically quantifying the expression of viral spike protein in bulk cell cultures\nC_LIO_LITargeting a highly conserved region in the S2 subunit of the S protein allows broad detection of several SARS-CoV-2 isolates in different cell lines\nC_LIO_LIScreening of antivirals in microtiter format and determining the antiviral activity as inhibitory concentrations 50 (IC50)\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carina Conzelmann","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrea Gilg","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ruediger Gross","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Desiree Schuetz","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nico Preising","author_inst":"Core Facility Functional Peptidomics, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ludger Staendker","author_inst":"Core Facility Functional Peptidomics, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bernd Jahrsdoerfer","author_inst":"Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Hubert Schrezenmeier","author_inst":"Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Konstantin MJ Sparrer","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Thomas Stamminger","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Steffen Stenger","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jan Muench","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Janis A Mueller","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yuefeng Zou","author_inst":"Biotheus Inc."},{"author_name":"Weihui Fu","author_inst":"Biotheus Inc."},{"author_name":"Liping Wan","author_inst":"Biotheus Inc."},{"author_name":"Javier Gilbert Jramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Michael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sun","author_inst":"Biotheus Inc."},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Liu","author_inst":"Biotheus Inc."},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Andy Tsun","author_inst":"Biotheus Inc."},{"author_name":"Yingda Xu","author_inst":"Biotheus Inc."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.150607","rel_title":"Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S Protein: Biophysical, Biochemical, Structural, and Antigenic Analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.150607","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health crisis caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and there is a critical need to produce large quantities of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein for use in both clinical and basic science settings. To address this need, we have evaluated the expression and purification of two previously reported S protein constructs in Expi293F and ExpiCHO-S cells, two different cell lines selected for increased expression of secreted glycoproteins. We show that ExpiCHO-S cells produce enhanced yields of both SARS-CoV-2 S proteins.

Importantly, we show that multiple preparations of these two recombinant S proteins from either cell line exhibit identical behavior in two different serology assays. We also evaluate the specificity of S protein-mediated host cell binding by examining interactions with proposed binding partners in the human secretome. In addition, the antigenicity of these proteins is demonstrated by standard ELISAs, and in a flexible protein microarray format.

Observed effects on the central nervous system includes neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis. However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear. Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-COV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed. First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is expressed throughout various caliber vessels in the frontal cortex. Additionally, ACE2 was also detectable in primary human brain microvascular endothelial (hBMVEC) maintained under cell culture conditions. Analysis for cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48hr exposure window. However, when the viral spike proteins were introduced into model systems that recapitulate the essential features of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), breach to the barrier was evident in various degrees depending on the spike protein subunit tested. Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluid model of the human BBB, a platform that most closely resembles the human physiological conditions at this CNS interface. Subsequent analysis also showed the ability for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function. Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tetyana P Buzhdygan","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Brandon J DeOre","author_inst":"Rowan University"},{"author_name":"Abigail Baldwin-Leclair","author_inst":"Rowan University"},{"author_name":"Hannah McGary","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Roshanak Razmpour","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Peter A Galie","author_inst":"Rowan University"},{"author_name":"Raghava Potula","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Allison M Andrews","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Servio Heybert Ramirez","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Laura Y Yen","author_inst":"New York Structural Biology Center"},{"author_name":"Alex J Noble","author_inst":"New York Structural Biology Center"},{"author_name":"Mykhailo Kopylov","author_inst":"New York Structural Biology Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey B Bonanno","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Garrett-Thomson","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David B Hayes","author_inst":"Intl Solidarity of Scientists LLC"},{"author_name":"Robert H Bortz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ariel S Wirchniaski","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Catalina Florez","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Ethan Laudermilch","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"J Maximilian Fels","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"M Eugenia Dieterle","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit K Jangra","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mengotto","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna P Daily","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liise-anne Pirofski","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kartik Chandran","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Brenowitz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott J Garforth","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edward T Eng","author_inst":"New York Structural Biology Center"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R Lai","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Steven C Almo","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"neuroscience"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.151647","rel_title":"Genome-wide mapping of therapeutically-relevant SARS-CoV-2 RNA structures","rel_date":"2020-06-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.151647","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a linear single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of [~]30 kb, whose outbreak caused the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

As for other RNA viruses, genomic RNA structures are expected to play crucial roles in several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle. Despite this, only a handful of functionally conserved structural elements within coronavirus RNA genomes have been identified to date.\n\nHere, we performed RNA structure probing by SHAPE-MaP to obtain a single-base resolution secondary structure map of the full SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome. The SHAPE-MaP probing data recapitulate the previously described coronavirus RNA elements (5' UTR, ribosomal frameshifting element, and 3' UTR), and reveal new structures. Secondary structure-restrained 3D modeling of highly-structured regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome allowed for the identification of several putative druggable pockets. Furthermore, [~]8% of the identified structure elements show significant covariation among SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, hinting at their functionally-conserved role. In addition, we identify a set of persistently single-stranded regions having high sequence conservation, suitable for the development of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics.\n\nCollectively, our work lays the foundation for the development of innovative RNA-targeted therapeutic strategies to fight SARS-related infections.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ilaria Manfredonia","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Chandran Nithin","author_inst":"International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (Warsaw)"},{"author_name":"Almudena Ponce-Salvatierra","author_inst":"International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (Warsaw)"},{"author_name":"Pritha Ghosh","author_inst":"Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Protein Engineering, International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Tomasz K.

For this, sensitive, specific and quantitative serological assays are required. Here we describe the development of a semi-quantitative high-content microscopy-based assay for detection of three major classes (IgG, IgA and IgM) of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human samples. The possibility to detect antibodies against the entire viral proteome together with a robust semi-automated image analysis workflow resulted in improvement of sensitivity and specificity compared to an approved ELISA-based diagnostic test. Combining both methods resulted in maximum specificity in a negative control cohort, while maintaining high sensitivity.

Such mutations can occur in the spike (S) protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). However, whether S mutations affect SARS-CoV-2 infectivity remains unknown. Here, we show that naturally occurring S mutations can reduce or enhance cell entry via ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped lentivirus exhibits substantially lower entry than SARS-CoV S. Among S variants, the D614G mutant shows the highest cell entry, as supported by structural observations. Nevertheless, the D614G mutant remains susceptible to neutralization by antisera against prototypic viruses. Taken together, these data indicate that the D614G mutation enhances viral infectivity while maintaining neutralization susceptibility.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seiya Ozono","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yanzhao Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hirotaka Ode","author_inst":"Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Toong Seng Tan","author_inst":"Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University"},{"author_name":"Kazuo Imai","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuyasu Miyoshi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Kishigami","author_inst":"University of Yamanashi"},{"author_name":"Takamasa Ueno","author_inst":"Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University"},{"author_name":"Yasumasa Iwatani","author_inst":"Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tadaki Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kenzo Tokunaga","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Wolf","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Cerikan Berati","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.
