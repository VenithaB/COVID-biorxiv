At this stage, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease. Though it is difficult to trace back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable, estimating the average spreading rate is possible if a proper mathematical model can be devised to analyze daily event-occurrences. To render an accurate assessment, we have devised a state-space method for fitting the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. The proposed method detects changes occurring in each country and assesses the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number, which corresponds to the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to predict the possible consequences of alternative political measures. This information can serve as a reference for behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shinsuke Koyama","author_inst":"The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo 190-8562, Japan"},{"author_name":"Taiki Horie","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shigeru Shinomoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20150136","rel_title":"An exploratory Integrated Moving Average Time Series Model of the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in six (6) significantly impacted Countries","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20150136","rel_abs":"The 2019 Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a single-stranded RNA virus that has threatened the lives of humans all over the globe.

We show that the most widely referenced parameter, the 'basic reproduction number' (R0), is fundamentally connected to the relative odds of increasing or decreasing the infectives population. As a consequence, for R0 > 1 the probability that no outbreak occurs is 1\/R0. In stark contrast to a deterministic SIR, when R0 = 1.5 the random walk has a 67% chance of avoiding outbreak. Thus, an alternative, probabilistic, interpretation of R0 arises, which provides a novel estimate of the critical population density {gamma}\/r without fitting SIR models. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV2 in the United States is consistent with our model and attempt an estimate of {gamma}\/r. In doing so, we uncover a significant source of bias in public data reporting. Data are aggregated on political boundaries, which bear no concern for dispersion of population density. We show that this introduces bias in fits and parameter estimates, a concern for understanding fundamental virus parameters and for policy making. Anonymized data at the resolution required for contact tracing would afford access to {gamma}\/r without fitting. The random walk SIR developed here highlights the intuition that any epidemic is stochastic and recovers all the key parameter values noted by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bradley M Dickson","author_inst":"Van Andel Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elaina Pascarella","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Shigeru Shinomoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20150029","rel_title":"A flexible COVID-19 model to assess mitigation, reopening, virus mutation and other changes","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20150029","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 epidemic which began in China last year has expanded worldwide.

The study objective was to develop a wastewater testing method to analyze SARS-CoV-2 as an indicator of community infection rate resurgence of COVID-19 or in well-defined sites such as production facilities or nursing homes. Eurofins performed >700 tests on 78 unique samples from 18 sites in Denmark, France and Belgium. Ten variant test protocols were trialed. Protocol variations trialed included centrifugation, precipitation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, agitation prior to precipitation, cooling, and pasteurization of the samples. A method was succesfully developed and reliability was supported by stability, reproducibility, and dilution & linearity studies. Results obtained showed a direct link to number of RNA copies in the sample using a calibration curve with synthetic SARS-CoV-2. Analysis was performed on both the liquid phase and solid phase of wastewater samples, with virus RNA detected in both phases but more frequently in the liquid phase. The virus was present in a sample from a Danish community wastewater treatment plant collected on February 24, 3 days before the first COVID-19 case was officially reported in the country. The greatest concentration of virus detected corresponded to when the COVID-19 crisis was at its peak in Denmark. Based on studies carried out in a Danish hospital, the wastewater testing method is expected to be able to detect a community COVID-19 prevalence rate as low as a 0,02%-0,1% (i.e. between 2 virus shedders per 10000 and 1 virus shedder per 1000).

We analysed the risk of severe (in-hospital) COVID-19 across categories of obesity status and walking pace. As of June 20th 2020 there were 972 cases of severe COVID-19 that had occurred within the cohort. Compared to normal weight individuals, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for severe COVID-9 in those with obesity was 1.49 (1.24, 1.78). Compared to those with a brisk walking pace, the OR in slow walkers was 1.84 (1.49, 2.27). Slow walkers had the highest risk of severe COVID-19 regardless of obesity status. For example, compared to normal weight brisk walkers, the odds of severe COVID-19 in obese brisk walkers was 1.39 (0.99, 1.98), whereas the odds in normal weight slow walkers was 2.48 (1.56, 3.93). Self-reported walking pace, a simple measure of functional fitness, appears to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 that is independent of obesity.

This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression, including associated factors and coping methods among undergraduate students in a Nigerian university. It also examined the association between psychological state and family functioning. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional and involved 386 undergraduate students across the main faculties. The university's ethical review board approved the study with approval number UI\/EC\/20\/0242. An online questionnaire, using Google form, was circulated among the students through their faculty representatives. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs) was used in assessing anxiety and depression, while family functioning was assessed using the McMaster Family Assessment Device, (FAD). Data was entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), and analysis carried out using descriptive statistics, chi-square, independent t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Post-Hoc analysis and linear logistics regression, at  0.05. Results: The mean age was 21 {+\/-} 2.9 years, with a female population of 60.1%. Prevalence of anxiety and depression were 41.5% and 31.9% respectively. Students in health-related faculties were significantly less anxious than those in other faculties. Inability to afford three square meals, negative family functioning, having a chronic illness and living in a State\/Region with a high incidence of COVID-19, was significantly associated with depression. These factors jointly accounted for 14% of depression seen in undergraduate students. Most of the students coped by engaging themselves in social media, watching television\/movies and participating in other online skill development programmes. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of anxiety and depression among university students with poor family functioning, inability to afford three meals\/day, living in a state with a high incidence of COVID-19 and having a chronic illness, contributing to depression. Measures need to be taken to support undergraduate students and their families to prevent the negative consequences of poor mental health.

Low-resource countries, however, experience barriers to preparedness due to limited resources. In Ghana, a country with a constrained healthcare system and high COVID-19 cases, we examined HCWs' perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 and associated factors. Methods: 472 HCWs completed questions in a cross-sectional self-administered online survey. Perceived preparedness was assessed using a 15-question scale (Cronbach alpha=0.91) and summative scores were created (range=0-45). Higher scores meant greater perceived preparedness. We used linear regression with robust standard errors to examine associations between perceived preparedness and potential predictors. Results: The average preparedness score was 24 (SD=8.9); 27.8% of HCWs felt prepared. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher perceived preparedness were: training ({beta}=3.35, 95%CI: 2.01 to 4.69); having adequate PPE ({beta}=2.27, 95%CI: 0.26 to 4.29), an isolation ward ({beta}=2.74, 95%CI: 1.15 to 4.33), and protocols for screening ({beta}=2.76, 95%CI: 0.95 to 4.58); and good perceived communication from management ({beta}=5.37, 95%CI: 4.03 to 7.90). When added to the model, perceived knowledge decreased the effect of training by 28.0%, although training remained significant, suggesting a partial mediating role. Perceived knowledge was associated with a 6-point increase in perceived preparedness score ({beta}=6.04, 95%CI: 4.19 to 7.90). Conclusion: HCWs reported low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19. Training, clear protocols, PPE availability, isolation wards, and communication play an important role in increasing preparedness. Government stakeholders must institute necessary interventions to increase HCWs' preparedness to respond to the ongoing pandemic and prepare for future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patience A Afulani","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Akua O Gyamerah","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Raymond Aborigo","author_inst":"Navrongo Health Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Jerry Nutor","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Hawa Malechi","author_inst":"Tamale Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amos Laar","author_inst":"School of Public Health, University of Ghana"},{"author_name":"Mona Sterling","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"John J.K.

Compared to non-cancer subjects, cancer subjects (N=1,521) had significantly lower overall risk for COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 (0.68-0.92), P=2.60E-03]. However, a trend of higher risk for COVID-19 mortality was found among 256 COVID-19 positive cancer patients, especially for hematologic cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3.82 (1.17-12.01), P=0.02]. In cancer patients, while few demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity factors predicted risk for COVID-19 infection, older age, male sex, heart disease and hypertension significantly predicted COVID-19 mortality. The lower risk for COVID-19 infection is likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and more testing among cancer patients, an encouraging finding that demonstrates the feasibility of intervention. These results, if confirmed in future releases of UKB data and other independent populations, may provide guidance for COVID-19 prevention and treatment among cancer patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhuqing Shi","author_inst":"NorthShore University HealthSystem"},{"author_name":"W.

Data was gathered on an excel sheet, and statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Results: Sixteen studies were eligible from 693 initial studies, including 3,641 patients (64% males). There were thirteen retrospective studies and three prospective studies. There were 2,488 patients in the standard of care group (61.7%) and 1,153 patients (68.7%) in the Tocilizumab group.

Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset. Conclusions: Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys and for estimating the true infection prevalence in populations.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emelie Marklund","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Susannah Leach","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Hannes Axelsson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Kristina Nordstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Hel\u00e9ne Norder","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Mats Bemark","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Davide Angeletti","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Anna Lundgren","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Staffan Nilsson","author_inst":"Chalmers University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lars-Magnus Andersson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Aylin Yilmaz","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Lindh","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Jan-\u00c5ke Liljeqvist","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gissl\u00e9n","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150813","rel_title":"Societal heterogeneity contributes to complex dynamic patterns of the COVID-19 pandemics: insights from a novel Stochastic Heterogeneous Epidemic Model (SHEM)","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150813","rel_abs":"In the absence of a vaccine and impactful treatments, the most effective way to combat the virus is to find and implement mitigation strategies. An invaluable resource in this task is numerical modeling that can reveal key factors in COVID-19 pandemic development. On the other hand, it has become evident that regional infection curves of COVID-19 exhibit complex patterns which often differ from curves predicted by forecasting models. The wide variations in attack rate observed among different social strata suggest that this may be due to social heterogeneity not accounted for by regional models. We investigated this hypothesis by developing and using a new Stochastic Heterogeneous Epidemic Model (SHEM) that focuses on vulnerable subpopulations. We found that the isolation or embedding of vulnerable sub-clusters in a major population hub generated complex stochastic infection patterns which included multiple peaks and growth periods, an extended plateau, a prolonged tail, or a delayed second wave of infection. Embedded vulnerable groups became hotspots that drove infection despite efforts of the main population to socially distance, while isolated groups suffered delayed but intense infection. Amplification of infection by these hotspots facilitated transmission from one urban area to another, causing the epidemic to hopscotch in a stochastic manner to places it would not otherwise reach, resembling a microcosm of the situation worldwide as of September 2020. Our results suggest that social heterogeneity is a key factor in the formation of complex infection propagation patterns. Thus, the mitigation of vulnerable groups is essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. The design of our new model allows it to be applied in future studies of real-world scenarios on any scale, limited only by memory and the ability to determine the underlying topology and parameters.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander V Maltsev","author_inst":"National Institute on Aging, NIH"},{"author_name":"Michael D Stern","author_inst":"National Institute on Aging, NIH"},{"author_name":"Hannes Axelsson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Kristina Nordstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Hel\u00e9ne Norder","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Mats Bemark","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Davide Angeletti","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Anna Lundgren","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Staffan Nilsson","author_inst":"Chalmers University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lars-Magnus Andersson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Aylin Yilmaz","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Lindh","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Jan-\u00c5ke Liljeqvist","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gissl\u00e9n","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20151001","rel_title":"Estimating the Effect of Social Distancing Interventions on COVID-19 in the United States","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20151001","rel_abs":"Since its global emergence in 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused multiple epidemics in the United States. Because medical treatments for the virus are still emerging and a vaccine is not yet available, state and local governments have sought to limit its spread by enacting various social distancing interventions such as school closures and lockdown, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. We applied an established, semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe to the United States. We estimated the effect of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction number, Rt , for each state before and after lockdown, and contrasted predicted future fatalities with actual fatalities as a check on the model's validity. Overall, school closures and lockdown are the only interventions modeled that have a reliable impact on Rt , and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing Rt below 1.0. We conclude that reversal of lockdown, without implementation of additional, equally effective interventions, will enable continued, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew M.

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indonesia announced the first COVID-19 case on 2 March 2020. East Kalimantan has been determined as the new capital of Indonesia since 2019. This makes Samarinda as the capital of East Kalimantan has been focused for its capability of handling COVID-19 patients. We report the epidemiological characteristics and immunofluorescence assay results of these patients. Methods. All patients with positive confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR were admitted to hospitals and quarantine center in Samarinda. We retrospectively analyzed data from the daily report of the Samarinda City and East Kalimantan Health Office information system. Results. By June 25, 2020, 64 patients had been identified as having positive confirmed COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 37.3 {+\/-} 13.8 years. Most of the patients were men (57 [90.6%] patients). Thirty-nine COVID-19 patients were imported cases with a history of traveling from South Sulawesi. Most of the patients were admitted to the Quarantine Center of Samarinda City. The mean duration from the first hospital admission for isolation to discharge was 25.6 {+\/-} 13.1 days. There was only one death case of COVID-19 patients in Samarinda. There were the highest confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Samarinda in early June 2020. There was a declining trend in the age of COVID-19 patients and the duration of isolation time in the hospital. Discussion. Imported cases still contributed to the increase of COVID-19 cases in Samarinda. Younger age of COVID-19 patients was more involved in frequent mobility which makes them cause the spread of the disease. Activation of the national reference laboratory for the COVID-19 examination in Samarinda has reduced the length of time patients treated in hospitals. Conclusion. The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients show the ability of local governments to deal with this pandemic. This can be seen from the low case fatality rate in Samarinda.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swandari Paramita","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Ronny Isnuwardana","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Anton Rahmadi","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Osa Rafshodia","author_inst":"Samarinda City Health Office"},{"author_name":"Ismid Kusasih","author_inst":"Samarinda City Health Office"},{"author_name":"Mats Bemark","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Davide Angeletti","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Anna Lundgren","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Staffan Nilsson","author_inst":"Chalmers University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lars-Magnus Andersson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Aylin Yilmaz","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Lindh","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Jan-\u00c5ke Liljeqvist","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gissl\u00e9n","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150755","rel_title":"Serology in Children with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150755","rel_abs":"Objectives: We aimed to measure SARS-CoV-2 serologic responses in children hospitalized with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) compared to COVID-19, Kawasaki Disease (KD) and other hospitalized pediatric controls. Methods: From March 17, 2020 - May 26, 2020, we prospectively identified hospitalized children at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta with MIS-C (n=10), symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (n=10), KD (n=5), and hospitalized controls (n=4). With IRB approval, we obtained prospective and residual blood samples from these children and measured SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding domain (RBD) IgM and IgG binding antibodies by quantitative ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies by live-virus focus reduction neutralization assay. We statistically compared the log-transformed antibody titers among groups and performed correlation analyses using linear regression. Results: All children with MIS-C had high titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibodies, which correlated strongly with neutralizing antibodies (R2=0.667, P<0.001). Children with MIS-C had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody titers (geometric mean titer [GMT] 6800, 95%CI 3495-13231) than children with COVID-19 (GMT 626, 95%CI 251-1563, P<0.001), children with KD (GMT 124, 95%CI 91-170, P<0.001) and other hospitalized pediatric controls (GMT 85 [all below assay limit of detection], P<0.001). All children with MIS-C also had detectable RBD IgM antibodies, indicating recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RBD IgG titers correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (R2=0.512, P<0.046) and with hospital and ICU lengths of stay (R2=0.590, P=0.010). Conclusion: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titers may have a role in establishing the diagnosis of MIS-C, distinguishing it from other similar clinical entities, and stratifying risk for adverse outcomes.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina A.

Real-time data are needed to quantify direct and indirect effects. We aimed to monitor hospital activity for presentation, diagnosis and treatment of CVDs during the pandemic to inform on indirect effects. Methods: We analysed aggregate data on presentations, diagnoses and treatments or procedures for selected CVDs (acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, stroke and transient ischaemic attack, venous thromboembolism, peripheral arterial disease and aortic aneurysm) in UK hospitals before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. We produced an online visualisation tool to enable near real-time monitoring of trends. Findings: Nine hospitals across England and Scotland contributed hospital activity data from 28 Oct 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to 10 May 2020 (pre-easing of lockdown), and for the same weeks during 2018-2019. Across all hospitals, total admissions and emergency department (ED) attendances decreased after lockdown (23 March 2020) by 57.9% (57.1-58.6%) and 52.9% (52.2-53.5%) respectively compared with the previous year. Activity for cardiac, cerebrovascular and other vascular conditions started to decline 1-2 weeks before lockdown, and fell by 31-88% after lockdown, with the greatest reductions observed for coronary artery bypass grafts, carotid endarterectomy, aortic aneurysm repair and peripheral arterial disease procedures. Compared with before the first UK COVID-19 (31 January 2020), activity declined across diseases and specialties between the first case and lockdown (total ED attendances RR 0.94, 0.93-0.95; total hospital admissions RR 0.96, 0.95-0.97) and after lockdown (attendances RR 0.63, 0.62-0.64; admissions RR 0.59, 0.57-0.60). There was limited recovery towards usual levels of some activities from mid-April 2020. Interpretation: Substantial reductions in total and cardiovascular activities are likely to contribute to a major burden of indirect effects of the pandemic, suggesting they should be monitored and mitigated urgently.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- TC CVD-COVID-UK Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Simon Ball","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Midlands, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Colin Berry","author_inst":"Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Boyle","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Bray","author_inst":"IQVIA"},{"author_name":"William Bradlow","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Afzal Chaudhry","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Rikki Crawley","author_inst":"Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alastair Denniston","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Florian Falter","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jonine Figueroa","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christopher Hall","author_inst":"Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK London, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Emily Jefferson","author_inst":"Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Tom Johnson","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Graham King","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ken Lee","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular cience, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Paul McKean","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Mason","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK North"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mills","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ewen Pearson","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Scotland"},{"author_name":"Munir Pirmohamed","author_inst":"Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology and MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Michael TC Poon","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Rouven Priedon","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Anoop Shah","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Reecha Sofat","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK London, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sterne","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK South West, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Fiona Strachan","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Szarka","author_inst":"Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"William Whiteley","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.11.20151332","rel_title":"Diagnosis of COVID-19 using CT scan images and deep learning techniques","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.11.20151332","rel_abs":"Early diagnosis of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for controlling this pandemic.

Currently it is unknown whether a positive serology results correlates with protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. There are also concerns regarding the low positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, especially when testing populations with low disease prevalence. Methods. A neutralization assay was validated in a set of PCR confirmed positive specimens and in a negative cohort. 9,530 specimens were screened using the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology assay and all positive results (N=164) were reanalyzed using the neutralization assay, the Roche total immunoglobin assay, and the Abbott IgG assay. The relationship between the magnitude of a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology result and the levels of neutralizing antibodies detected was correlated. Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were also longitudinally monitored in SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed patients. Results. The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay had a PPA of 96.6% with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and a NPA of 98.0% across 100 negative controls. ID50 neutralization titers positively correlated with all three clinical serology platforms. Longitudinal monitoring of hospitalized PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrates they made high neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2. PPA between the Diazyme IgG assay alone and the neutralization assay was 50.6%, while combining the Diazyme IgG assay with either the Roche or Abbott platforms increased the PPA to 79.2% and 78.4%, respectively. Conclusions. For the first time, we demonstrate that three widely available clinical serology assays positively correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity observed in COVID-19 patients. When a two-platform screen and confirm approach was used for SARS-CoV-2 serology, nearly 80% of two-platform positive specimens had neutralization titers (ID50 >50).","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raymond T Suhandynata","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Melissa A Hoffman","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Deli Huang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jenny T Tran","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael J Kelner","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Sharon L Reed","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ronald W McLawhon","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"James E Voss","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Nemazee","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Robert Fitzgerald","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Alastair Denniston","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Florian Falter","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jonine Figueroa","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christopher Hall","author_inst":"Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK London, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Emily Jefferson","author_inst":"Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Tom Johnson","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Graham King","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ken Lee","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular cience, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Paul McKean","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Mason","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK North"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mills","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ewen Pearson","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Scotland"},{"author_name":"Munir Pirmohamed","author_inst":"Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology and MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Michael TC Poon","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Rouven Priedon","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Anoop Shah","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Reecha Sofat","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK London, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sterne","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK South West, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Fiona Strachan","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Szarka","author_inst":"Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"William Whiteley","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.11.20151365","rel_title":"Decreased serum levels of inflammaging marker miR-146a are associated with clinical response to tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.11.20151365","rel_abs":"Background. Current COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to global health and healthcare systems. At least in western countries, the most amount of the death toll is accounted by old people affected by age-related diseases. In this regard, we proposed that COVID-19 severity may be tightly related to inflammaging, i.e. the age-related onset of inflammation, which is responsible for age-related diseases. It has been reported that systemic hyper-inflammation may turn to be detrimental in COVID-19 patients. Objective. Here, we exploited a recently closed clinical trial (NCT04315480) on the anti-IL-6 drug tocilizumab to assess whether microRNAs regulating inflammaging can be assessed as biomarkers of drug response and outcome. Methods. Serum levels of miR-146a-5p, -21-5p, and -126-3p were quantified by RT-PCR and Droplet Digital PCR by two independent laboratories on 30 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19, characterized by multifocal interstitial pneumonia confirmed by CT-scan and requiring oxygen therapy, and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. COVID-19 patients were treated with a single-dose intravenous infusion of 8 mg\/kg tocilizumab and categorized into responders and non-responders. Results. We showed that COVID-19 patients who did not respond to tocilizumab have lower serum levels of miR-146a-5p after the treatment (p=0.007). Moreover, among non-responders, those with the lowest serum levels of miR-146a-5p experienced the most adverse outcome (p=0.008). Conclusion. Our data show that blood-based biomarkers, such as miR-146a-5p, can provide a molecular link between inflammaging and COVID-19 clinical course, thus allowing to enlarge the drug armory against this worldwide health threat.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacopo Sabbatinelli","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Angelica Giuliani","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Giulia Matacchione","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Silvia Latini","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Noemi Laprovitera","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Pomponio","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Alessia Ferrarini","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Silvia Svegliati Baroni","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Marianna Pavani","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Marco Moretti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Armando Gabrielli","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Antonio Domenico Procopio","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Manuela Ferracin","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Bonaf\u00e8","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Olivieri","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Emily Jefferson","author_inst":"Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Tom Johnson","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Graham King","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ken Lee","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular cience, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Paul McKean","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Mason","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK North"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mills","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ewen Pearson","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Scotland"},{"author_name":"Munir Pirmohamed","author_inst":"Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology and MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Michael TC Poon","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Rouven Priedon","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Anoop Shah","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Reecha Sofat","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK London, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sterne","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK South West, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Fiona Strachan","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Szarka","author_inst":"Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"William Whiteley","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150904","rel_title":"Serological Tests for SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus by Commercially Available Point-of-Care and Laboratory Diagnostics in Pre-COVID-19 Samples in Japan","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150904","rel_abs":"Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in pre-COVID-19 samples in Japan showed 1.5%-1.75% positives, and previous surveys might overestimate COVID-19 seroprevalence in several population of Japan.

The containment strategy for COVID-19, which has non-specific flu-like symptoms and where upwards of 80% of the affected has either mild or no symptoms, is critically centered upon diagnostic testing, tracking and isolation. Thus, the development of specific and sensitive diagnostic tests for COVID-19 is key towards the first successful step of disease management. Public health organizations like the WHO and the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed real-time PCR (RT-PCR) based diagnostic tests to aid in the detection of acute infection. In this study we sought to modify the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay protocol to increase its sensitivity and to make the assay directly portable to health care providers in a community-based hospital setting. A number of modifications to the original protocol were tested. Increasing the RT-PCR annealing temperature by 7{degrees}C to 62{degrees}C was associated with the most significant improvement in sensitivity, wherein the cycle-threshold (Ct) value for the N2 assay was reduced by ~3 units, in effect both reducing the overall number of inconclusive results and yielding N1\/N2 assays to have similar Ct values. The limit of detection of the modified assay was also improved (0.86 RNA copies\/l for both nCoV 2019_N1\/N2 assays) compared to the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay (1 and 3.16 RNA copies\/l for nCoV 2019_N1 and N2 assay, respectively). Using this modification, there was no significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 detection rate when viral RNA extraction was performed either manually or through an automated extraction method. We believe this modified protocol allows for more sensitive detection of the virus which in turn will be useful for pandemic management.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Srirupa Das","author_inst":"Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Candice Dowell-Martino","author_inst":"Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Lisa Arrigo","author_inst":"Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Paul N.

Border screening typically consists of arriving individuals being thermally scanned for signs of fever and\/or completing a survey to declare any possible symptoms, and while more thorough testing typically exists, these would generally prove more disruptive to deploy. In this paper, we utilise epidemiological data and Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the potential success rate of deploying border screening for a range of diseases (including the current COVID-19 pandemic) in varying outbreak scenarios. We negate the issue of testing precision by assuming a perfect test is used; our outputs then represent the best-case scenario. We then use these outputs to briefly explore the types of scenarios where the implementation of border screening could prove most effective. Our models only considers screening implemented at airports, due to air travel being the predominant method of international travel. Primary results showed that in the best-case scenario, screening has the potential to detect 46.4%, 12.9% and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and ebola respectively, while screening for COVID-19 could potentially detect 12.0% of infected travellers.

Assessing case density and spread of infection is critical and relies largely on clinical testing data. However, clinical testing suffers from known limitations, including test availability and a bias towards enumerating only symptomatic individuals. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has gained widespread support as a potential complement to clinical testing for assessing COVID-19 infections at the community scale. The efficacy of WBE hinges on the ability to accurately characterize SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. To date, a variety of sampling schemes have been used without consensus around the appropriateness of grab or composite sampling. Here we address a key WBE knowledge gap by examining the variability of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater grab samples collected every 2 hours for 72 hours compared with corresponding 24-hour flow-weighted composite samples. Results show relatively low variability (mean for all assays = 741 copies 100 mL-1, standard deviation = 508 copies 100 mL-1) for grab sample concentrations, and good agreement between most grab samples and their respective composite (mean deviation from composite = 159 copies 100 mL-1). When SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are used to calculate viral load, the discrepancy between grabs (log10 difference = 12.0) or a grab and its associated composite (log10 difference = 11.8) are amplified. A similar effect is seen when estimating carrier prevalence in a catchment population with median estimates based on grabs ranging 62-1853 carriers. Findings suggest that grab samples may be sufficient to characterize SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, but additional calculations using these data may be sensitive to grab sample variability and warrant the use of flow-weighted composite sampling. These data inform future WBE work by helping determine the most appropriate sampling scheme and facilitate sharing of datasets between studies via consistent methodology.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyle Curtis","author_inst":"Hampton Roads Sanitation District"},{"author_name":"David Keeling","author_inst":"Hampton Roads Sanitation District"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Yetka","author_inst":"Hampton Roads Sanitation District"},{"author_name":"Allison Larson","author_inst":"Hampton Roads Sanitation District"},{"author_name":"Raul Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hampton Roads Sanitation District"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Pomponio","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Alessia Ferrarini","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Silvia Svegliati Baroni","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Marianna Pavani","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Marco Moretti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera \"Ospedali Riuniti\" di Ancona"},{"author_name":"Armando Gabrielli","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Antonio Domenico Procopio","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Manuela Ferracin","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Bonaf\u00e8","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Olivieri","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Emily Jefferson","author_inst":"Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Tom Johnson","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Graham King","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ken Lee","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular cience, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Paul McKean","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Mason","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK North"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mills","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ewen Pearson","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Scotland"},{"author_name":"Munir Pirmohamed","author_inst":"Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology and MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Michael TC Poon","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Rouven Priedon","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Anoop Shah","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Reecha Sofat","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK London, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sterne","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK South West, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Fiona Strachan","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Szarka","author_inst":"Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"William Whiteley","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150656","rel_title":"Diagnostic value of skin manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150656","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 causes multiple immune-related reactions at various stages of the disease. The wide variety of skin presentations has delayed linking these to the virus. Previous studies had attempted to look at the prevalence and timing of SARS-COV-2 rashes but were based on mostly hospitalized severe cases and had little follow up. Using data collected on a subset of 336,847 eligible UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app, we observed that 8.8% of the swab positive cases (total: 2,021 subjects) reported either a body rash or an acral rash, compared to 5.4% of those with a negative swab test (total: 25,136). Together, these two skin presentations showed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41-1.96) for being swab positive. Skin rashes were also predictive in the larger untested group of symptomatic app users (N=54,652), as 8.2% of those who had reported at least one classical COVID-19 symptom, i.e., fever, persistent cough, and\/or anosmia, also reported a rash. Data from an independent online survey of 11,546 respondents with a rash showed that in 17% of swab positive cases, the rash was the initial presentation. Furthermore, in 21%, the rash was the only clinical sign. Skin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other classical symptoms. Recognising rashes is important in identifying new and earlier COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veronique Bataille","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Niccolo' Rossi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abigail Bournot","author_inst":"Zoe Global Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Armando Gabrielli","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Antonio Domenico Procopio","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Manuela Ferracin","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Bonaf\u00e8","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Olivieri","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche"},{"author_name":"Emily Jefferson","author_inst":"Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Tom Johnson","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Graham King","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ken Lee","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular cience, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Paul McKean","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Mason","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK North"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mills","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ewen Pearson","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Scotland"},{"author_name":"Munir Pirmohamed","author_inst":"Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology and MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Michael TC Poon","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Rouven Priedon","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Anoop Shah","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Reecha Sofat","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK London, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sterne","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK South West, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Fiona Strachan","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Szarka","author_inst":"Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"William Whiteley","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20147942","rel_title":"The emergence of COVID-19 in Indonesia: analysis of predictors of infection and mortality using independent and clustered data approaches","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20147942","rel_abs":"Background: Analyses of correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mortality have usually assessed individual predictors. This study aimed to determine if patterns of combined predictors may better identify risk of infection and mortality. Methods: For the period of March 2nd to 10th 2020, the first 9 days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia, we selected all 18 confirmed cases, of which 6 died, and all 60 suspected cases, of which 1 died; and 28 putatively negative patients with pneumonia and no travel history. We recorded data for travel, contact history, symptoms, haematology, comorbidities, and chest x-ray. Hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) and principal component analyses (PCA) identified cluster and covariance patterns for symptoms or haematology which were analysed with other predictors of infection or mortality using logistic regression. Results: For univariate analyses, no significant association with infection was seen for fever, cough, dyspnoea, headache, runny nose, sore throat, gastrointestinal complaints (GIC), or haematology. A PCA symptom component for fever, cough, and GIC tended to increase risk of infection (OR 3.41; 95% CI 1.06 - 14; p=0.06), and a haematology component with elevated monocytes decreased risk (OR 0.26; 0.07 - 0.79; 0.027). Multivariate analysis revealed that an HCA cluster of 3-5 symptoms, typically fever, cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat but little dyspnoea and no GIC tended to reduce risk (aOR 0.048; <0.001 - 0.52; 0.056). In univariate analyses for death, an HCA cluster of cough, fever and dyspnoea had increased risk (OR 5.75; 1.06 - 31.3, 0.043), but no other individual predictor, cluster or component was associated. Other significant predictors of infection were age >= 45, international travel, contact with COVID-19 patient, and pneumonia. Diabetes and history of contact were associated with higher mortality. Conclusions: Cluster groups and co-variance patterns may be stronger correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection than individual predictors. Comorbidities may warrant careful attention as would COVID-19 exposure levels.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erlina Burhan","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology and Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia;

All patients, including asymptomatic patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition to a qualitative answer, providing viral load values to the RT-PCR results not only helped the clinician to evaluate the stage of the infection but addressed patient contagiousness and guided infection control decisions. Here, we discuss the importance of reporting viral load values when a shift from a symptomatic to a universal screening strategy was performed.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Milo Moraz","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Damien Jacot","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Matthaios Papadimitriou-Olivgeris","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Service, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Laurence Senn","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Service, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Gilbert Greub","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Katia Jaton","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Onya Opota","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Dewi Puspitorini","author_inst":"Gatot Soebroto Central Army Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Dewi Lestari","author_inst":"Raden Mattaher District Hospital, Jambi, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Indah Suci Widyahening","author_inst":"Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Vivi Setiawaty","author_inst":"Center for Research and Development for Biomedical and Basic Health Technology, National Institute of Health Research and Development, Ministry of Health, Repub"},{"author_name":"Dwiana Ocviyanti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Kartika Qonita Putri","author_inst":"Medical Study Program, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Aswin Guntara","author_inst":"Medical Study Program, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Davrina Rianda","author_inst":"Human Nutrition Research Center, Indonesian Medical Education and Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Anuraj H Shankar","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research "},{"author_name":"Rina Agustina","author_inst":"Human Nutrition Research Center, Indonesian Medical Education and Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia; Department of Nutrition, Faculty "},{"author_name":"Graham King","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ken Lee","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular cience, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Paul McKean","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Mason","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK North"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mills","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ewen Pearson","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Scotland"},{"author_name":"Munir Pirmohamed","author_inst":"Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology and MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Michael TC Poon","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Rouven Priedon","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Anoop Shah","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Reecha Sofat","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK London, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sterne","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK South West, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Fiona Strachan","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Szarka","author_inst":"Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"William Whiteley","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
