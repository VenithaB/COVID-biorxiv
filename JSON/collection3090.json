The disease has already affected over 6 million individuals, with over 400,000 fatalities. Recent studies have confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in feces of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients using RT-PCR tests. It is however, still unclear as to whether or not live SARS-CoV-2 virus is actually present in feces of these patients. In this rapid review, we systematically analyzed literature to establish any evidence of live SARS-CoV-2 virus in fecal samples of COVID-19 patients. We identified 4 studies (one case report, 2 case series and 1 cohort study) where the SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from fecal samples of COVID-19 patients using culture techniques. Therefore, there is some evidence COVID-19 could shed live SARS-CoV-2 virus via the gastro-intestinal tract. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings, as well as to determine its potential for disease transmission and infection, and possible implications for COVID-19 discharge and isolation policies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Prabjot Sehmi","author_inst":"University of Nairobi"},{"author_name":"Isaac Cheruiyot","author_inst":"University of Nairobi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20133561","rel_title":"Extracorporeal Cytokine Hemadsorption in Severe COVID-19 Respiratory Failure","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20133561","rel_abs":"Despite the extracorporeal cytokine hemadsorption device CytoSorb was granted FDA emergency approval for critically ill COVID19 patients, to our knowledge no published studies are currently available to support its use.

In December 2019, a new highly contagious coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China. SARS-CoV-2 causes a potentially lethal human respiratory infection, COVID-19, that is associated with fever and cough and can progress to pneumonia and dyspnea in severe cases. Since the virus emerged, it has spread rapidly, reaching all continents around the world. A previous study has shown that, despite being the best alternative in the current pandemic context, social distancing measures alone may not be sufficient to prevent COVID-19 spread, and the overall impact of the virus is of great concern. The present study aims to describe the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of 672 cities with cases of COVID-19, as well as to determine a predictive model for the number of cases. We analyzed data from cities with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 until June 26, 2020. It was observed that cities with confirmed cases of the disease are present in all Brazilian states, affecting 36.5% of the municipalities in Rio de Janeiro State. The inhabitants in cities with reported cases of COVID-19 represent more than 73.1% of the Brazilian population. Stratifying the age groups of the inhabitants and accounting for the percentage of women and men does not affect COVID-19 incidence (confirmed cases\/100,000 inhabitants). The demographic density, the MHDI and the per capita income of the municipalities with cases of COVID-19 do not affect disease incidence. In addition, if conditions are maintained, our model predicts 2,358,703 (2,172,930 to 2,544,477) cumulative cases on July 25, 2020.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isadora C Carneiro","author_inst":"Instituto Carlos Chagas - Fiocruz\/PR"},{"author_name":"Eloiza D Ferreira","author_inst":"Instituto Carlos Chagas - Fiocruz\/PR"},{"author_name":"Jana\u00edna C da Silva","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia de Tumores, Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana, UNIOESTE"},{"author_name":"Guilherme Soares","author_inst":"Instituto Carlos Chagas - Fiocruz\/PR"},{"author_name":"Daisy M Strottmann","author_inst":"Instituto Carlos Chagas - Fiocruz\/PR"},{"author_name":"Guilherme F Silveira","author_inst":"Instituto Carlos Chagas - Fiocruz\/PR"},{"author_name":"Widyastuti Widyastuti","author_inst":"Public Health Office of Jakarta Province"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20142117","rel_title":"Statistics associated with the lethality of COVID-19 by age group and gender in Mexico","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20142117","rel_abs":"We analyzed outcomes of 102,985 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases of patients attending the IMSS (Mexican Institute for National Insurance) from January 2 to August 3, 2020.

The method is based on a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model that describes the virus transmission. A two-stage estimation method, which combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate reported state variables (active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational transfer function to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used with case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Our method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate. We show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g., age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models. We also apply it to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, where we see a delay of about four days in predicting the epidemic peak.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agus Hasan","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Hadi Susanto","author_inst":"Khalifa University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Venansius Tjahjono","author_inst":"Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November"},{"author_name":"Rudy Kusdiantara","author_inst":"Institut Teknologi Bandung"},{"author_name":"Endah Putri","author_inst":"Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November"},{"author_name":"Panji Hadisoemarto","author_inst":"Universitas Padjadjaran"},{"author_name":"Nuning Nuraini","author_inst":"Institut Teknologi Bandung"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20142141","rel_title":"The Influence of Time-Limited Immunity on a COVID-19 Epidemic: A Simulation Study","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20142141","rel_abs":"A series of spreadsheet simulations using SEIS, SEIR, and SEIRS models showed that different durations of effective immunity could have important consequences for the prevalence of an epidemic disease with COVID-19 characteristics.

Shorter durations of immunity resulted in oscillations in disease prevalence. Immunity that lasted from three months to two years produced recurrent disease outbreaks triggered by the expiration of immunity. If immunity faded out gradually instead of persisting at full effectiveness to the end of the immune period, the recurrent outbreaks became more frequent.

Emerging emergence has suggested that several factors may be associated with increased risk from severe outcomes or death from COVID-19. Clinical risk prediction tools have significant potential to generate individualised assessment of risk and may be useful for population stratification and other use cases. Methods and analysis: We will use a prospective open cohort study of routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England in the QResearch database. The primary outcome is COVID-19 mortality (in or out-of-hospital) defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate, or death occurring in a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 24th January and 30th April 2020. Our primary outcome in adults is COVID-19 mortality (including out of hospital and in hospital deaths). We will also examine COVID-19 hospitalisation in children. Time-to-event models will be developed in the training data to derive separate risk equations in adults (19-100 years) for males and females for evaluation of risk of each outcome within the 3-month follow-up period (24th January to 30th April 2020), accounting for competing risks. Predictors considered will include age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, pre-existing medical co-morbidities, and concurrent medication. Measures of performance (prediction errors, calibration and discrimination) will be determined in the test data for men and women separately and by ten-year age group. For children, descriptive statistics will be undertaken if there are currently too few serious events to allow development of a risk model. The final model will be externally evaluated in (a) geographically separate practices and (b) other relevant datasets as they become available. Ethics and dissemination: The project has ethical approval and the results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Hippisley-Cox","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ashley Kieran Clift","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol AC Coupland","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Ruth Keogh","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karla Diaz-Ordaz","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ewen Harrison","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew Hayward","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Horby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nisha Mehta","author_inst":"Department of Health and Social Care"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Kieran Benger","author_inst":"NHS Digital"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"David Spiegelhalter","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Aziz Sheikh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Valabhji","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"John Robson","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20136168","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 & Pediatric Mental Health: A Review of Recent Evidence","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20136168","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and was met with lockdown policies to curb the spread of the disease.

Mental health disorders are suggested to have a well-correlated link to suicide which is the third most leading cause of death worldwide amongst children aged 15-19 years. According to WHO, 'health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease'. Hence the isolation brought about by SARS-CoV-2 is postulated to cause anxiety, fear, and depression amongst the pediatric population, due to the loss of socialization and separation from friends.

Methods: A purposive sample of publicly accessible governmental and popular international health organization websites was selected. The readability of the websites Covid-19 public health information was estimated using the previously validated SMOG readability formula, which determined reading level by correlating the number of polysyllabic words. Results: Of the 10 websites included in the analysis, none had Covid-19 public health information at the USDHHS recommended reading level. The material ranged in reading level at undergraduate level or above. Discussion: The findings indicate that the online Covid-19 materials need to be modified in order to reach recommended reading levels. This study can be of practical use to policy makers and public health government officials when designing, modifying, and evaluating Covid-19 materials.

Three different causal models were used to capture stochastic, chaotic and symbolic natured time-series data and to provide a robust & unbiased analysis by constructing networks of causal relationships between the variables. Granger-Causality method, Transfer Entropy method & Convergent Cross-Mapping (CCM) was done on data from regions with different temperatures and cases greater than 50,000 as of 13th May 2020. From the Granger-Causality test we found that in only Canada, the United Kingdom, temperature and daily new infections are causally linked. The same results were obtained from Convergent Cross Mapping for India. Again using Granger-Causality test, we found that in Russia only, relative humidity is causally linked to daily new cases. Thus, a Generalized Additive Model with a smoothing spline function was fitted for these countries to understand the directionality. Using the combined results of the said models, we were able to conclude that there is no evidence of a causal association between temperature, humidity and Covid-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raghav Awasthi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aditya Nagori","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Singh","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ridam Pal","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vineet Joshi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ewen Harrison","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew Hayward","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Horby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nisha Mehta","author_inst":"Department of Health and Social Care"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Kieran Benger","author_inst":"NHS Digital"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"David Spiegelhalter","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Aziz Sheikh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Valabhji","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"John Robson","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20142232","rel_title":"EVALUATION OF THE ROCHE ELECSYS ANTI-SARS-COV-2 ASSAY.","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20142232","rel_abs":"Background: Little is known about the performance of the Roche novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody (anti-SARS-CoV-2) assay. We provide an extensive evaluation of this fully automated assay on the Cobas e801\/e602 immunoassay analysers. Methods: We assessed the linearity, precision, and throughput of the Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Sensitivity was calculated from 349 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive samples; specificity was determined from 714 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-naive samples. We examined cross-reactivity against other antibody positive samples (syphilis, RF, ANA, ds-DNA, influenza, dengue, HBV, HCV) and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 kinetics. Results: The assay cut-off index (COI) was linear up to 90.7. The inter-assay precision was 2.9% for a negative control (COI=0.1) and 5.1% for a positive control (COI=3.0). Assay time is 18min and results are available 1 minute later; throughput for 300 samples was 76 minutes. No cross-reactivity was observed with other antibody positive samples; specificity was 100%. The assay has a sensitivity of 97.1% 14 days after PCR positivity (POS) and 100% at [&ge;]21 days POS; 48.2% of cases had anti-SARS-CoV-2 within 6 days POS. In 11 subjects in whom serum was available prior to a positive antibody signal (COI [&ge;]1.0) the interval between the last negative and first positive COI (time to sero-conversion) on average is 3 days (range 1-6 days) and 4 more days (range 1-7) for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 to plateau. Conclusion: The Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay shows excellent performance with minimal cross-reactivity from other viral and confounding antibodies. Antibody development and sero-conversion appears quite early.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"CS Lau","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"SP Hoo","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"SF Yew","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"SK Ong","author_inst":"Sengkang General Hospital"},{"author_name":"LT Lum","author_inst":"Sengkang General Hospital"},{"author_name":"PY Heng","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat Hospital"},{"author_name":"JG Tan","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat Hospital"},{"author_name":"MS Wong","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat Hospital"},{"author_name":"TC Aw","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter Horby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nisha Mehta","author_inst":"Department of Health and Social Care"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Kieran Benger","author_inst":"NHS Digital"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"David Spiegelhalter","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Aziz Sheikh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Valabhji","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"John Robson","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20141945","rel_title":"A Robust, Safe and Scalable Magnetic Nanoparticle Workflow for RNA Extraction of Pathogens from Clinical and Environmental Samples","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20141945","rel_abs":"Diagnosis and surveillance of emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 depend on nucleic acid isolation from clinical and environmental samples. Under normal circumstances, samples would be processed using commercial proprietary reagents in Biosafety 2 (BSL-2) or higher facilities. A pandemic at the scale of COVID-19 has caused a global shortage of proprietary reagents and BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently needed to address these challenges. We developed an open-source method called Magnetic- nanoparticle-Aided Viral RNA Isolation of Contagious Samples (MAVRICS) that is built upon reagents that are either readily available or can be synthesized in any molecular biology laboratory with basic equipment. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in samples inactivated in acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. Using 36 COVID-19 patient samples, 2 wastewater samples and 1 human pathogens control sample, we showed that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in validated diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. MAVRICS is scalable and thus could become an enabling technology for widespread community testing and wastewater monitoring in the current and future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerardo Ramos-Mandujano","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Rahul Salunke","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Sara Mfarrej","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Andri Rachmadi","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Sharif Hala","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Jinna Xu","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Fadwa S Alofi","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Department, King Fahad Hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Asim Khogeer","author_inst":"Plan and Research Department, General Directorate of Health Affairs Makkah Region, MOH, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Anwar M Hashem","author_inst":"Vaccines and Immunotherapy Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center; King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Naif AM Almontashiri","author_inst":"College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taibah University, Madinah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Afrah Alsomali","author_inst":"King Abdullah Medical Complex (KAMC), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Samir Hamdan","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Peiying Hong","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Arnab Pain","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Mo Li","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Valabhji","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"John Robson","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20140475","rel_title":"Reliability of serological tests for COVID-19: Comparison of three immunochromatography test kits for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20140475","rel_abs":"Background: Several immunochromatographic serological test kits have been developed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies, but their relative performance and potential clinical utility is unclear. Methods: Three commercially available serological test kits were evaluated using 99 serum samples collected from 29 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results: The IgM antibody-positive rates of the three serological test kits for samples taken at the early stage of the disease (0-6 days after onset) were 19.0%, 23.8%, and 19.0%, respectively. The IgM antibody-positive rates over the entire period were 21.2%, 60.6%, and 15.2%, respectively. The IgG antibody-positive rates for samples taken after 13 days of onset were 100.0%, 97.6%, and 97.6%, respectively. Conclusion: There were large differences among the results of the three test kits. Only few cases showed positive results for IgM in the early stage of disease and the IgM antibody-positive rates over the entire period were low, suggesting that the kits used in this study were unsuitable for diagnosis of COVID-19. The IgG antibody was positive in almost all samples after 13 days of onset, suggesting that it may be useful for determining infections in the recent past.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hidetsugu Fujigaki","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Masao Takemura","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Michiko Osawa","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aki Sakurai","author_inst":"Fujita Health University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Nakamoto","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Koichi Seto","author_inst":"Fujita Health University"},{"author_name":"Takashi Fujita","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadayoshi Hata","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hidehiko Akiyama","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yohei Doi","author_inst":"Fujita Health University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuniaki Saito","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control and Prevention, Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Samir Hamdan","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Peiying Hong","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Arnab Pain","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Mo Li","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Valabhji","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"John Robson","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20142240","rel_title":"Association of BMI and Obesity with Composite poor outcome in COVID-19 adult patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20142240","rel_abs":"Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the association between obesity and composite poor outcome in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles in COVID-19 adult patients and obesity based on classification of Body Mass Index (BMI) and composite poor outcome which consist of mortality, morbidity, admission of Intensive Care Unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and severe COVID-19. Results: Nine studies were included in meta-analysis with 6 studies presented BMI as continuous outcome and 3 studies presented BMI as dichotomous outcome (obese and non-obese). Most studies were conducted in China (55.5%) with remaining studies from French, Germany, and United States (US). COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome had higher BMI with mean difference 0.55 kg\/m2 (95% CI 0.07-1.03, P=0.02). BMI [&ge;]30 (obese) was associated with composite poor outcome with odds ratio 1.89 (95% CI 1.06-3.34, P=0.03). Multivariate meta-regression analysis by including three moderators: age, hypertension, and Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM type 2) showed the association between obesity and composite poor outcome was affected by age with regression coefficient =-0.06 and P=0.02. Subgroup analysis was not performed due to the limited number of studies for several outcomes. Conclusion: Obesity is a risk factor of composite poor outcome of COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome have higher BMI. BMI is an important routine procedure that should be assessed in the management of COVID-19 patients and special attention should be given to patients with obesity.

Accurate information on the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 is vital for policy makers and health care providers. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of weekly data for Ohio. To estimate expected mortality in 2020 we employed data from 2010 through 2019, adjusted for secular trends and seasonality. We estimated excess mortality as the number of observed deaths less the number of expected deaths. We conducted the analysis for the entire population and by age, gender, and county. Results: We estimated 2,088 (95% CI 1,119-3,119) excess deaths due to natural causes in Ohio from March 15, 2020 through June 6, 2020. While the largest number excess of deaths was observed in the 80+ age group, our estimate of 366 (95% CI 110-655) excess deaths for those between 20 and 49 years of age substantially exceeds the reported number of COVID-19 deaths of 66. Conclusions: Our methodology addressed some of the challenges of estimating the number of deaths caused by COVID-19. Our finding of excess deaths being considerably greater than the reported number of COVID-19 deaths for those aged 20 to 49 years old suggests that current tracking methods may not capture a significant number of COVID-19 deaths for this group. Further, increases in the infection rates for this cohort may have a greater mortality impact than anticipated.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Troy Quast","author_inst":"University of South Florida, College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ross Andel","author_inst":"University of South Florida, College of Behavioral and Community Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kaijun Jiang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shelcie Fabre","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Catherine Teo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Guh Asthagiri Arunkumar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meagan McMahon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Nowak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Valabhji","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"John Robson","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142281","rel_title":"Early Hemoglobin kinetics in response to ribavirin: Safety lesson learned from Hepatitis C to CoVID-19 therapy","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142281","rel_abs":"Background: Ribavirin (RBV) is been used for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This drug is associated with a wide range of side effects, mainly anemia, so its use in patients with potential respiratory affectation could not be appropriate. The evidences of adverse events associated with RBV-use has mainly been derived in the context of hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, however the possible use of RBV in CoVID-19 patients could be limited to 14 days. Methods: Longitudinal study including HIV\/HCV coinfected patients. We evaluate the hemoglobin dynamics and reductions as well as evaluate the development rate of anemia during the first 2 weeks of therapy in HCV infected patients. Results: 189 patients were included in the study. The median hemoglobin levels were 14.6 g\/dL (IQR: 13.2-15.6 g\/dL) and 13.5 g\/dL (IQR: 12.3-14.5 g\/dL) at weeks 1 and 2 of therapy, respectively. A cumulative number of 27 (14.2%) patients developed anemia (23 grade 1 [12.1%] and 4 grade 2 [2.1%]). We identify a baseline hemoglobin levels of 14 g\/dL as the better cut-off to identify those patients with a high chance to develop anemia. Of the 132 patients with baseline hemoglobin level >14 g\/dL, 8 developed anemia (6.1%) compared with 19 of 57 (33.3%) with hemoglobin levels lower than 14 g\/dL (p < 0.001).

These are often collectively labelled social distancing and lockdown. On the 23rd June 2020, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced substantial easings of restrictions. This paper examines some of the data he presented. Methods: Generalised additive models, with negative binomial errors and cyclic term representing day-of-week effects, were fitted to data on the daily numbers of new confirmed cases of COVID-19. Exponential rates for the epidemic were estimated for different periods, and then used to calculate R, the reproduction number, for the disease in different periods. Results: After an initial stabilisation, the lockdown reduced R to around 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.82). This value increased to around 0.94 (95% CI 0.89, 0.996) for the fortnight from the 9th June 2020. Conclusions: Official UK data, presented as the easing of the lockdown was announced, shows that R was already more than half way back to 1 at that point. That suggests there was little scope for the announced changes to be implemented without restarting the spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mike Lonergan","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Mario Frias","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Isabel Machuca","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Marina Gallo","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Pedro Lopez-Lopez","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Angela Camacho","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Rivero","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Guh Asthagiri Arunkumar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meagan McMahon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Nowak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Valabhji","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"John Robson","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20142174","rel_title":"COVID-19: Saving lives and livelihoods using population density driven testing","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20142174","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk generally increases with proximity of those shedding the virus to those susceptible to infection.

To understand which containment measures altered disease dynamics, we estimate change points in COVID-19 dynamics from official Italian data. We find excellent correlation between nationwide lockdown and the epidemic peak in late March 2020. Surprisingly, we find a change point in mid April, which does not correspond to national measures, but may be explained by regional interventions. Change points in regional COVID-19 dynamics correlate well with local distribution of free face masks and regional orders requiring their mandatory use. Regions with no specific interventions showed no change point during April.

There is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19, and the use of Remdesivir for treating COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutations is crucial for the management of Remdesivir resistance. We used a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping to generate a total of 100,000 mutations and provide insight into the functional outcome of mutations in the Remdesivir-binding site in nsp12. After designing 56 residues in the Remdesivir binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 96-98% sequence identity, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 attains resistance and develops further infectivity with very few mutations in the nsp12. We also identified affinity-attenuating Remdesivir binding designs of nsp12. Several mutants acquired decreased binding affinity with Remdesivir, which suggested drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop Remdesivir and related drug-based resistance. A comparison of 21 nsp12 Remdesivir-bound designs to the 13 EIDD-2801-bound nsp12 designs suggested that EIDD-2801 would be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistant mutations and against Remdesivir-resistance strains due to the restricted mutational landscape. Combined with the availability of more genomic data, our information on mutation repertoires is critical to guide scientists to rational structure-based drug discovery. Knowledge of the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding and management of drug resistance and disease pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditya Padhi","author_inst":"RIKEN"},{"author_name":"Rohit Shukla","author_inst":"North-Eastern Hill University"},{"author_name":"Timir Tripathi","author_inst":"North-Eastern Hill University"},{"author_name":"Marina Gallo","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Pedro Lopez-Lopez","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Angela Camacho","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Rivero","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Guh Asthagiri Arunkumar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meagan McMahon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Nowak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Valabhji","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"John Robson","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.174557","rel_title":"Stereotypic Neutralizing VH Clonotypes Against SARS-CoV-2 RBD in COVID-19 Patients and the Healthy Population","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.174557","rel_abs":"In six of seven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients, VH clonotypes, encoded by either immunoglobin heavy variable (IGHV)3-53 or IGHV3-66 and immunoglobin heavy joining (IGHJ)6, were identified in IgG1, IgA1, and IgA2 subtypes, with minimal mutations, and could be paired with diverse light chains, resulting in binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD).

Serum samples, along with nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from various cohorts and analyzed by ELISA and rRT-PCR, respectively. A total of 167 serum samples were tested for serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient cohorts, 15 (8.9%) were positive by rRT-PCR and the remaining 152 (91%) were negative. We used these data to generate two different assay cutoffs for serum IgG assay and investigated percent concordance with rRT-PCR test results. The emergency department data revealed, out of 151 nasopharyngeal swabs, 4 (2.6%) were positive by rRT-PCR and 18 (11.9%) were positive for serum IgG assay. Among the 18 patients that were positive for serum IgG, 13 (72.2%) exhibited 1-3 symptoms of COVID-19 and 5 (27.7%) patients did not present with any COVID-19 related symptoms, per CDC criteria.

Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like structures that depend on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces a subset of these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet.

Although s2m is not universally present among coronaviruses and appears to undergo horizontal transfer, the high sequence conservation and universal presence of s2m among isolates of SARS-CoV-2 indicate that, when present, the element is essential for viral function.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Torstein Tengs","author_inst":"The Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Charles F Delwiche","author_inst":"University of Maryland, College Park"},{"author_name":"Christine M Jonassen","author_inst":"Ostfold Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Changfu Yao","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephen Beil","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Chandani Sen","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Arunima Purkayastha","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jay Kolls","author_inst":"Tulane School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Derek Pociask","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Pessina","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Boston"},{"author_name":"Carolina Garcia-de-Alba","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Boston"},{"author_name":"Carla Kim","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Boston"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Gomperts","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Barry Stripp","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Wan Beom Park","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Myoung-don Oh","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Sunghoon Kwon","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Junho Chung","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.171173","rel_title":"An in vitro assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of oral preparations of iodine complexes (RENESSANS)","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.171173","rel_abs":"Since the emergence of CoVID-19 pandemic in China in late 2019, scientists are striving hard to explore non-toxic, viable anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds or medicines. We determined In Vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of oral formulations (syrup and capsule) of an Iodine-complex (Renessans). A monolayer of vero cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the presence and absence of different concentrations (equivalent to 50, 05 and 0.5 g\/ml of I2) of Renessans. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of each of the formulation was assessed in the form of cell survival, SARS-CoV-2-specific cytopathic effect (CPE) and genome quantization. With varying concentrations of syrup and capsule, a varying rate of inhibition of CPE, cells survival and virus replication was observed. Compared to 0.5 g\/ml concentration of Renessans syrup, 5 and 50 g\/ml showed comparable results where there was a 100% cell survival, no CPEs and a negligible viral replication ({Delta}CT= 0.11 and 0.13, respectively). This study indicates that Renessans, containing iodine, may have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 which needs to be further investigated in human clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Imran Altaf","author_inst":"Quality Operation Laboratory,  University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Faisal Nadeem","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nadir Hussain","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Nawaz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sohail Raza","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Asad Ali","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sohail Hasan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nazish Matti","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ashraf","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Ihsan Ullah","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Waqar Aziz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sehar Fazal","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Saira Rafique","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Adnan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nageen Sardar","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Tahir Khan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Moavia","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore;"},{"author_name":"Sohaib Ashraf","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Sheikh Zaid Hospital Lahore"},{"author_name":"Zarfishan Tahir","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nadia Mukhtar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Tahir Yaqub","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.178293","rel_title":"Angiotensin-(3-4) modulates angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) downregulation in proximal tubule cells due to overweight and undernutrition: implications regarding the severity of renal lesions in Covid-19 infection","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.178293","rel_abs":"The renal lesions \u2013 including severe acute kidney injury \u2013 are severe outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. There are no reports regarding the influence of the nutritional status on the severity and progress of these lesions. Ageing is also an important risk factor. In the present communication we compare the influence of overweight and undernutrition in the levels of renal angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the progress of kidney failure during Covid-19, we also investigated the influence of Angiotensin-(3\u20134) (Ang-(3\u20134)) the shortest angiotensin-derived peptide, which is considered the physiological antagonist of several angiotensin II effects. We found that both overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration of Ang-(3\u20134) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in undernourished rats. We conclude that chronic and opposite nutritional conditions play a central role in the pathophysiology of renal Covid-19 lesions, and that the role of RAAS is also different in overweight and undernutrition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael Luzes","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Humberto Muzi-Filho","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Amaury Pereira-Acacio","author_inst":"Graduate Program of Translational Biomedicine\/BIOTRANS UNIGRANRIO\/INMETRO\/UEZO"},{"author_name":"Thuany Crisostomo","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Adalberto Vieyra","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Asad Ali","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sohail Hasan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nazish Matti","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ashraf","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Ihsan Ullah","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Waqar Aziz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sehar Fazal","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Saira Rafique","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Adnan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nageen Sardar","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Tahir Khan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Moavia","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore;"},{"author_name":"Sohaib Ashraf","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Sheikh Zaid Hospital Lahore"},{"author_name":"Zarfishan Tahir","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nadia Mukhtar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Tahir Yaqub","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"}]}
