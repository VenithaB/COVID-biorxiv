Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, in cultured cells. The effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 M. Ciclesonide inhibited formation of double membrane vesicles, which anchor the viral replication-transcription complex in cells. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide still suppressed replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.\n\nImportanceThe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. To identify the effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide suppresses replication of coronaviruses, including beta-coronaviruses (MHV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in cultured cells. The inhaled ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family. It could be prescribed for the treatment of MERS, and COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shutoku Matsuyama","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Miyuki Kawase","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Naganori Nao","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kazuya Shirato","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Ujike","author_inst":"Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University"},{"author_name":"Wataru Kamitani","author_inst":"Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masayuki Shimojima","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shuetsu Fukushi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Dennis de Meulder","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mart M Lamers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Rijnders","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Casper Rokx","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Frank Grosveld","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Dubravka Drabek","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Corine GeurtsvanKessel","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Berend Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Thijs Kuiken","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Barry Rockx","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.264564","rel_title":"Flagellin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa increases the expression of the SARS-CoV2 entry protease TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells","rel_date":"2020-08-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.264564","rel_abs":"The major challenge of the COVID-19 health crisis is to identify the factors of susceptibility to SARS-Cov2 in order to adapt the recommendations to the populations and to reduce the risk of getting COVID-19 to the most vulnerable people especially those having chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) including cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic pulmonary respiratory diseases (COPD).

Here, we generated cellular heat shock chaperone protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), to deliver SARS-CoV-2 protein S (spike) to the immune system and to induce cell-mediated immune responses. We showed that our vaccine platform effectively stimulates a robust cellular immune response against protein S. Moreover, we confirmed that gp96-Ig, secreted from allogeneic cells expressing full-length protein S, generates powerful, protein S polyepitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lung interstitium and airways. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that protein-S -specific CD8+ T cells were induced in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-02-01 transgenic mice thus providing encouraging translational data that the vaccine is likely to work in humans, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eva Fisher","author_inst":"Univesrity of Miami"},{"author_name":"Laura Padula","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Krisitn Podack","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Matthew M Seavey","author_inst":"Heat Biologics"},{"author_name":"Padmini Jayaraman","author_inst":"Heat Biologics"},{"author_name":"Rahul Jasuja","author_inst":"Heat Biologics"},{"author_name":"Natasa Strbo","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Shuetsu Fukushi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Dennis de Meulder","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mart M Lamers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Rijnders","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Casper Rokx","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Frank Grosveld","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Dubravka Drabek","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Corine GeurtsvanKessel","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Berend Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Thijs Kuiken","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Barry Rockx","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.264895","rel_title":"The influence of major S protein mutations of SARS-CoV-2 on the potential B cell epitopes","rel_date":"2020-08-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.264895","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly transmitted worldwide and results in the COVID-19 pandemic. Spike glycoprotein on surface is a key factor of viral transmission, and has appeared a lot of variants due to gene mutations, which may influence the viral antigenicity and vaccine efficacy. Here, we used bioinformatic tools to analyze B-cell epitopes of prototype S protein and its 9 common variants. 12 potential linear and 53 discontinuous epitopes of B-cells were predicted from the S protein prototype. Importantly, by comparing the epitope alterations between prototype and variants, we demonstrate that B-cell epitopes and antigenicity of 9 variants appear significantly different alterations. The dominant D614G variant impacts the potential epitope least, only with moderately elevated antigenicity, while the epitopes and antigenicity of some mutants(V483A, V367F, etc.) with small incidence in the population change greatly. These results suggest that the currently developed vaccines should be valid for a majority of SARS-CoV-2 infectors. This study provides a scientific basis for large-scale application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and for taking precautions against the probable appearance of antigen escape induced by genetic variation after vaccination.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has lasted for more than half a year and has not yet been contained. Until now there is no effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 caused disease (COVID-19). Successful vaccine development seems to be the only hope. However, this novel coronavirus belongs to the RNA virus, there is a high mutation rate in the genome, and these mutations often locate on the Spike proteins of virus, the gripper of the virus entering the cells. Vaccination induce the generation of antibodies, which block Spike protein. However, the Spike protein variants may change the recognition and binding of antibodies and make the vaccine ineffective. In this study, we predict neutralizing antibody recognition sites (B cell epitopes) of the prototype S protein of SARS-COV2, along with several common variants using bioinformatics tools. We discovered the variability in antigenicity among the mutants, for instance, in the more widespread D614G variant the change of epitope was least affected, only with slight increase of antigenicity. However, the antigenic epitopes of some mutants change greatly. These results could be of potential importance for future vaccine design and application against SARS-CoV2 variants.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xianlin Yuan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Liangping Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Krisitn Podack","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Matthew M Seavey","author_inst":"Heat Biologics"},{"author_name":"Padmini Jayaraman","author_inst":"Heat Biologics"},{"author_name":"Rahul Jasuja","author_inst":"Heat Biologics"},{"author_name":"Natasa Strbo","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Shuetsu Fukushi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Dennis de Meulder","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mart M Lamers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Rijnders","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Casper Rokx","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Frank Grosveld","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Dubravka Drabek","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Corine GeurtsvanKessel","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Berend Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Thijs Kuiken","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Barry Rockx","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.21.20179317","rel_title":"Health Disparities and COVID-19: A Retrospective Study Examining Individual and Community Factors Causing Disproportionate COVID-19 Outcomes in Cook County, Illinois, March 16-May 31, 2020","rel_date":"2020-08-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.21.20179317","rel_abs":"Background: Early data from the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that the disease has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color causing higher infection and mortality rates within those communities.

This information is critical for policy makers and practitioners to ensure the safety of staff, students and the wider community during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Public Health England initiated enhanced national surveillance following the reopening of educational settings during the summer mini-term on 01 June 2020. COVID-19 related situations in educational settings across England were reviewed daily and followed-up until 31 July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreak rates were calculated for staff and students attending early year settings, primary and secondary schools during June 2020. FINDINGS There were 67 single confirmed cases, 4 co-primary cases and 30 COVID-19 outbreaks during June 2020, with a strong correlation between number of outbreaks and regional COVID-19 incidence (0.51 outbreaks for each SARS-CoV-2 infection per 100,000 in the community; p=0.001). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon across all educational settings. Staff members had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to students in any educational setting, and the majority of cases linked to outbreaks were in staff. The probable transmission direction for the 30 confirmed outbreaks was: staff-to-staff (n=15), staff-to-student (n=7), student-to-staff (n=6) and student-to-student (n=2). INTERPRETATION SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon in educational settings during the first month after the easing of national lockdown in England. The strong correlation with regional SARS-CoV-2 incidence emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission to protect educational settings. Additional interventions should focus on reducing transmission in and among staff members.

This systematic review aims to evaluate the association between PLR levels on admission and the severity of COVID-19 patients. Methods A systematic literature search was done on 23 July 2020 to identify peer-reviewed studies across four different databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library), preprints from two databases (MedRxiv and SSRN), and grey literature from two databases (WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database and Center for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article). Research articles comparing the PLR value on admission in adult patients with COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity were included in the analysis. The following keywords were used for the search: 'COVID-19', 'PLR', 'severity', and 'mortality'. The inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled effect standardized mean difference (SMD) along with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results A total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, six of which were conducted in China. From a total of 998 participants included, 316 (31.7%) had severe diseases; and those in the severe group were generally older and had underlying diseases compared to the non-severe group. In comparison to non-severe patients, the meta-analysis showed that severe COVID-19 patients had higher PLR levels on admission (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.43-0.93; I2 =58%). Conclusion High PLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, on-admission PLR level is a novel, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker with a promising prognostic role for determining the severity of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Martin Simadibrata","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Bashar Adi Wahyu Pandhita","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Muammar Emir Ananta","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Tamara Tango","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Robert CA Warmerdam","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Johanna C Herkert","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Floranne Boulogne","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Annique Claringbould","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands and Structural Computational Biology unit, EMB"},{"author_name":"Esteban A Lopera-Maya","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Meike Bartels","author_inst":"Department of Biological Psychology, FGB, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Amsterdam Public Health research institute, Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jouke-Jan Hottenga","author_inst":"Department of Biological Psychology, FGB, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ganna","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Juha Karjalainen","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;

Identifying the risk-factors associated with infection and outcomes in cancer patients is necessary to develop healthcare recommendations. Methods: We analyzed electronic health records of the US National Veterans Administration healthcare system and assessed the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients. We evaluated the proportion of cancer patients tested for Covid-19 and their confirmed positivity, with clinical characteristics, and outcome, and stratified by demographics, comorbidities, cancer treatment and cancer type. Results: Of 22914 cancer patients tested for Covid-19, 1794 (7.8%) were positive. The prevalence of Covid-19 was similar across all ages. Higher prevalence was observed in African-American (AA) (15%) compared to white (5.5%; P<.001), in Hispanic vs non-Hispanic population and in patients with hematologic malignancy compared to those with solid tumors (10.9% vs 7.7%; P<.001). Conversely, prevalence was lower in current smoker patients, patients with other co-morbidities and having recently received cancer therapy (<6 months). The Covid-19 attributable mortality was 10.9%. Highest mortality rates were observed in older patients, those with renal dysfunction, higher Charlson co-morbidity score and with certain cancer types. Recent (<6 months) or past treatment did not influence mortality. Importantly, AA patients had 3.5-fold higher Covid-19 attributable hospitalization, however had similar mortality rate as white patients. Conclusion: Pre-existence of cancer affects both susceptibility to Covid-19 infection and eventual outcome. The overall Covid-19 attributable mortality in cancer patients is affected by age, co-morbidity and specific cancer types, however, race or recent treatment including immunotherapy does not impact outcome.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathanael R Fillmore","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer La","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Raphael E Szalat","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David P Tuck","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vinh Nguyen","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Cenk Yildirim","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Nhan V Do","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary T Brophy","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nikhil C Munshi","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Meike Bartels","author_inst":"Department of Biological Psychology, FGB, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Amsterdam Public Health research institute, Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jouke-Jan Hottenga","author_inst":"Department of Biological Psychology, FGB, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ganna","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Juha Karjalainen","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;

In order to determine the variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the state of Nevada, 200 patient specimens from COVID-19 patients were sequenced through our robust protocol for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our protocol enabled sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome directly from the specimens, with even very low viral loads, without the need of culture-based amplification. This allowed the identification of specific nucleotide variants including those coding for D614G and clades defining mutations. These sequences were further analyzed for determining SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the state of Nevada and their phylogenetic relationships with other variants present in the united states and the world during the same period of the outbreak. Our study reports the occurrence of a novel variant in the nsp12 (RNA dependent RNA Polymerase) protein at residue 323 (314aa of orf1b) to Phenylalanine (F) from Proline (P), present in the original isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1). This 323F variant is found at a very high frequency (46% of the tested specimen) in Northern Nevada. Functional significance of this unique and highly prevalent variant of SARS-CoV-2 with RdRp mutation is currently under investigation but structural modeling showed this 323aa residue in the interface domain of RdRp, which is required for association with accessory proteins. In conclusion, we report the introduction of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants at a very high frequency within a distinct geographic location, which is important for clinical and public health perspectives in understanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 while in circulation.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Hartley","author_inst":"Nevada Genomics Center, University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Richard L Tillett","author_inst":"Nevada Institute of Personalized Medicine, University of Nevada, Las Vegas"},{"author_name":"Yanji Xu","author_inst":"Nevada Center for Bioinformatics, University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"David P AuCoin","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joel R Sevinsky","author_inst":"Theiagen Consulting, LLC"},{"author_name":"Andrew Gorzalski","author_inst":"Nevada State Public Health Laboratory, University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Mark C Pandori","author_inst":"Nevada State Public Health Laboratory, Pathology & Lab Medicine, University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erin Buttery","author_inst":"Southern Nevada Public Health Laboratory of the Southern Nevada Health District, Las Vegas"},{"author_name":"Holly Hansen","author_inst":"Southern Nevada Public Health Laboratory of the Southern Nevada Health District, Las Vegas"},{"author_name":"Michael Picker","author_inst":"Southern Nevada Public Health Laboratory of the Southern Nevada Health District, Las Vegas"},{"author_name":"Cyprian C Rossetto","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology & Immunology,  University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Subhash C Verma","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Juha Karjalainen","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;

We explore the compatibility between multiple DNA polymerases with high strand-displacement activity and thermostable reverse transcriptases required for RT-LAMP. We optimize reaction conditions and demonstrate their applicability using both synthetic RNA and clinical patient samples. Finally, we validated the optimized RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw nasopharyngeal samples from 184 patients.

Here, we report that for COVID-19 this does not apply. By investigating temporal IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns in 32 COVID-19 patients hospitalized for pneumonia and longitudinally followed for the development of respiratory failure and death, we reveal that IFN-{lambda} and type I IFN production is both diminished and delayed, induced only in a fraction of patients as they become critically ill. On the contrary, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 are produced before IFNs, in all patients, and persist for a prolonged time. By comparison, in 16 flu patients hospitalized for pneumonia with similar clinicopathological characteristics to COVID-19 and 24 milder non-hospitalized flu patients IFN-{lambda} and type I IFN are robustly induced, earlier, at higher levels and independently of disease severity, while pro-inflammatory cytokines are only acutely and transiently produced. Notably, higher IFN-{lambda} levels in COVID-19 patients correlate with lower viral load in bronchial aspirates and faster viral clearance, and a higher IFN-{lambda}:type I IFN ratio with improved outcome of critically ill patients. Moreover, altered cytokine patterns in COVID-19 patients correlate with longer hospitalization time and higher incidence of critical disease and mortality compared to flu. These data point to an untuned antiviral response in COVID-19 contributing to persistent viral presence, hyperinflammation and respiratory failure.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioanna Evdokia Galani","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Nikoletta Rovina","author_inst":"ICU, 1st Department of Respiratory Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Sotiria General Hospital of Chest Diseases, Athens,"},{"author_name":"Vicky Lampropoulou","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Triantafyllia","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Maria Manioudaki","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Pavlos","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Koukaki","author_inst":"1st Department of Respiratory Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Sotiria General Hospital of Chest Diseases, Athens, Gree"},{"author_name":"Paraskevi C Fragkou","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Panou","author_inst":"1st Department of Respiratory Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Sotiria General Hospital of Chest Diseases, Athens, Gree"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Rapti","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Ourania Koltsida","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Andreas Mentis","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Koulouris","author_inst":"1st Department of Respiratory Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Sotiria General Hospital of Chest Diseases, Athens, Gree"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Antonia Koutsoukou","author_inst":"ICU, 1st Department of Respiratory Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Sotiria General Hospital of Chest Diseases, Athens,"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Andreakos","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Xiushan Yin","author_inst":"Applied Biology Laboratory, Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, 110142, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Vicent Pelechano","author_inst":"SciLifeLab, Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology.

As governments begin to relax restrictions on public life there is a need to understand the potential impact that reopening schools may have on transmission. Methods We used data provided by the UK Department for Education to construct a network of English schools, connected through pairs of pupils resident at the same address. We used the network to evaluate the potential for transmission between schools, and for long range propagation across the network, under different reopening scenarios. Results Amongst the options evaluated we found that reopening only Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 (4-6 and 10-11 year olds) resulted in the lowest risk of transmission between schools, with outbreaks within a single school unlikely to result in outbreaks in adjacent schools in the network. The additional reopening of Years 10 and 12 (14-15 and 16-17 year olds) resulted in an increase in the risk of transmission between schools comparable to reopening all primary school years (4-11 year olds). However, the majority of schools presented low risk of initiating widespread transmission through the school system. Reopening all secondary school years (11-18 year olds) resulted in large potential outbreak clusters putting up to 50% of households connected to schools at risk of infection if sustained transmission within schools was possible. Conclusions Reopening secondary school years is likely to have a greater impact on community transmission than reopening primary schools in England. Keeping transmission within schools limited is essential for reducing the risk of large outbreaks amongst school-aged children and their household members.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James D Munday","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Katharine Sherratt","author_inst":"London school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sophie Meakin","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akira Endo","author_inst":"London School Of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl A.

No antiviral treatment options are currently available with proven clinical efficacy. However, preliminary findings from phase III trials suggest that remdesivir is an effective and safe treatment option for COVID-19 patients with severe disease. Objective: The aim of the present meta-analysis is to investigate whether remdesivir is effective for treating COVID-19 including reduced in-hospital adverse events, oxygen support, and mortality rates. Methods: Using PRISMA reporting guidelines, a review was conducted from January 1 2020 until 6 August 2020 with MeSH terms including COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID, remdesivir, adenosine nucleoside triphosphate analog, Veklury using Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus. A modified Delphi process was used to include the studies and ensure that the objectives were addressed (Appendix A). Using dichotomous data for select values, the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated applying Mantel Haenszel (M-H) random-effects method in Review Manager 5.4. Results: Randomized controlled trials pooled in 2,429 participants with 41.6% (n=1011) in the remdesivir group and 58.4% (n=1,418) in the placebo group. The placebo group had a higher risk of mortality as compared to the intervention group with significant odds ratio (OR=0.61) (95% confidence interval of 0.45-0.83; P=0.001). There was moderate heterogeneity among the studies. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that remdesivir extends clinical benefits by reducing mortality, adverse events and oxygen support in moderate to severely ill COVID-19 patients. Concerted efforts and further randomized placebo-controlled trials are warranted to examine the potency of anti-viral drugs and immune-pathological host responses contributing to severity of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Azza Sarfraz","author_inst":"Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakisan."},{"author_name":"Zouina Sarfraz","author_inst":"Fatima Jinnah Medical University, Lahore, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Marcos Sanchez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Jack Michel","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"George Michel","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Odalys Frontela","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Jorge Posada","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Jose Cardona","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

METHODS An analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19 cohort, in five-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for estradiol therapy was death. Odds Ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15-49 years) and post-menopausal (>50 years). RESULTS The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in women than men (about +15%) and, in contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about +50%). Interestingly, the relationships between these quantities are also linked to age. Pre-adolescent girls had the same risk of infection and fatality rate as boys. Adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk of infection than men in the same five-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This ratio changed again in postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years there was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely neglected. Because the hormone 17{beta}-estradiol has a positive effect on expression of the human ACE2 protein--which plays an essential role for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry--propensity score matching was performed for the women's sub-cohort, comparing users versus non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women >50 yrs receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95 % CI [0.18, 0.62] and the Hazard Ratio was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15-49 yrs), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels. CONCLUSIONS As of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ute Seeland","author_inst":"Institute of Physiology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Flaminia Coluzzi","author_inst":"Department Medical and Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Department Neurosciences, Mental Health and Sensory Organs, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Cameron Mura","author_inst":"School of Data Science and Dept of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Philip E Bourne","author_inst":"School of Data Science and Dept of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Max Heiland","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Robert Preissner","author_inst":"Institute of Physiology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

However, the standard quarantine period could be reduced for negative contacts if combined with PCR testing to assess SARS-CoV-2 negative status. We used a simulation model for contact tracing, accounting for the incubation period, infectivity profile, and time-varying probability of detection by PCR to estimate the transmission potential of traced contacts averted by different durations of quarantine and number of tests. We also investigated the effect of reducing test and tracing delays, and reduced adherence to quarantine guidance. Assuming perfect adherence to quarantine and self-isolation upon symptom onset, we find that a negative PCR test on day 10 of the quarantine would reduce the transmission potential from secondary cases similarly to the current 14 day quarantine rule: 68% (50% UI: 37, 100%) vs. 70% (50% UI: 38, 90%), respectively. A PCR test taken on the day of tracing would avert 57% of transmission potential on average (50% UI: 25%, 81%). Halving observed delays from having a test to the tracing of contacts to an average of 2 days reduces the pre-tracing transmission potential to 11% (50% UI: 2%, 27%) compared to 29% (50% UI: 8, 62%) with an average 4 day delay. Poor adherence greatly reduces the transmission potential averted (7% (50% UI: 4, 90%) using a reported 10% adherence rate in the UK for a 14 day quarantine). PCR testing may allow for a reduction in the duration of quarantine of traced contacts from 14 to 10 days without increasing the risk for onward transmission. Testing immediately after tracing could further reduce quarantine but would slightly increase the transmission risk. Multiple testing provided little additional benefit. Reducing delays and increasing adherence are likely to increase the ability of test, trace, isolate to reduce transmission above that of the introduction of PCR testing.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Billy J Quilty","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Samuel Clifford","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Preissner","author_inst":"Institute of Physiology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

Insufficient testing for COVID19 underestimates the incidence and inflates the case\/fatality proportion. Given the age and sex distribution of morbidity and mortality from COVID19, the underlying sex and age distribution of a population needs to be accounted for. The aim of this paper is to present a method for monitoring trends of COVID19 using adjusted mortality trend ratios (AMTR). Methods Age and sex mortality distribution of a reference population composed of the first 14,086 fatalities which occurred before the end of March and were reported in Europe by some countries were used to calculate age and sex specific mortality rates per 1,000,000 population. These were applied to each country population to calculate the expected deaths. Adjusted Mortality Trend Ratios (AMTRs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) were calculated for selected European countries from 17\/03\/2020 to 22\/06\/2020 by dividing observed cumulative mortality, by expected mortality times the crude mortality of the reference population. These estimated the sex and age adjusted mortality for COVID19 per million population in each country. Results The cumulative mortality from COVID19, the crude mortality rates, and the AMTRs were calculated for each country and compared. United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain registered the highest mortality in Europe. On 22\/06\/2020 in Europe the total mortality rate from COVID-19 was 352 per 1,000,000 inhabitants; and it was highest in Belgium (850 per 1,000,000 inhabitants) followed by Spain, UK, Italy, Sweden and France. When accounting for the underlying age and sex structure of each country, Belgium remained the single country experiencing the highest AMTR of 929 per million inhabitants on 22\/06\/2020; however Ireland (which had a CMR in line with the total European population) emerged as having experienced a much more important impact of COVID19 mortality with an AMTR of 550\/million on 22\/06\/2020, higher than Sweden and Italy. Conclusions In understanding and managing the pandemic of COVID19, comparable international data is a priority. Our methods allow a fair comparison of mortality in space and over time. The authors urge the WHO, given the absence of age and sex-specific mortality data for direct standardisation, to adopt this method to estimate the comparative mortality from COVID19 pandemic worldwide.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valentina Gallo","author_inst":"University of Gronongen"},{"author_name":"Paolo Chiodini","author_inst":"University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli"},{"author_name":"Dario Bruzzese","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Elias Kondilis","author_inst":"Aristotheles University of Thessaloniki"},{"author_name":"Daniel Howdon","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Jochen Mierau","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Raj Bhopal","author_inst":"University of Ediburgh"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

Using a publicly available and recently collected dataset on Japanese citizens during the COVID-19 early outbreak and exploiting both Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and regression analysis, the study notes that socio-demographic and personal attributes of individuals indeed shape the subjective prevention actions and thereby the control of the spread of a pandemic. Three socio-demographic attributes (sex, marital family status and having children) appear to have played an influential role in abiding by the COVID-19 protection behaviours by Japanese citizens, especially with women having children being noted more conscious than the male counterparts. Work status also appears to have some impact especially concerning social distancing and personal protection behaviour. Among the personality attributes, smoking behaviour appeared as a contributing factor with non-smokers or less-frequent smokers more compliant to the protection behaviours. Overall, the findings imply the need of public policy campaigning to account for variations in protection behaviour due to socio-demographic and personal attributes during a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shahadat Uddin","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Tasadduq Imam","author_inst":"CQUniversity (Melbourne)"},{"author_name":"Matloob Khushi","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Arif Khan","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Moni","author_inst":"University of New south Wales"},{"author_name":"Jochen Mierau","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Raj Bhopal","author_inst":"University of Ediburgh"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

Computational methods have been applied to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in five different countries (Ireland, Germany, UK, South Korea and Iceland) using their reported daily infection data. A Gaussian convolution smoothing function constructed a continuous epidemic line profile that was segmented into longitudinal time series of mathematically fitted individual logistic curves. The time series of fitted curves allowed comparison of disease progression with differences in decreasing daily infection numbers following the epidemic peak being of specific interest. A positive relationship between rate of declining infections and countries with comprehensive COVID-19 testing regimes existed. In contrast, extended epidemic timeframes were recorded for those least prepared for large scale testing and contact tracing. As many countries continue to struggle to implement population wide testing it is prudent to explore additional measures that could be employed. Comparative analysis of healthcare worker (HCW) infection data from Ireland shows it closely related to that of the entire population with respect to trends of daily infection numbers and growth rates over a 57-day period. With 31.6% of all test-confirmed infections in healthcare workers (all employees of healthcare facilities), they represent a concentrated 3% subset of the national population which if exhaustively tested (regardless of symptom status) could provide valuable information on disease progression in the entire population (or set). Mathematically, national population and HCWs can be viewed as a set and subset with significant influences on each other, with solidarity between both an essential ingredient for ending this crisis.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Wu","author_inst":"RCSI"},{"author_name":"Pol Mac Aonghusa","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Donal O'Shea","author_inst":"Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"},{"author_name":"Arif Khan","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Moni","author_inst":"University of New south Wales"},{"author_name":"Jochen Mierau","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Raj Bhopal","author_inst":"University of Ediburgh"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

To date, such interventions have neither been uniformly nor systematically implemented in most countries. For example, even when under strict stay-at-home orders, numerous jurisdictions granted exceptions and\/or were in close proximity to locations with entirely different regulations in place. Here, we investigate the impact of such geographic inconsistencies in epidemic control policies by coupling search and mobility data to a simple mathematical model of SARS-COV2 transmission. Our results show that while stay-at-home orders decrease contacts in most areas of the United States of America (US), some specific activities and venues often see an increase in attendance. Indeed, over the month of March 2020, between 10 and 30% of churches in the US saw increases in attendance; even as the total number of visits to churches declined nationally. This heterogeneity, where certain venues see substantial increases in attendance while others close, suggests that closure can cause individuals to find an open venue, even if that requires longer-distance travel. And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churches in the US rose by 13% over the same period. Strikingly, our mathematical model reveals that, across a broad range of model parameters, partial measures can often be worse than no measures at all. In the most severe cases, individuals not complying with policies by traveling to neighboring jurisdictions can create epidemics when the outbreak would otherwise have been controlled. Taken together, our data analysis and modelling results highlight the potential unintended consequences of inconsistent epidemic control policies and stress the importance of balancing the societal needs of a population with the risk of an outbreak growing into a large epidemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Muir Althouse","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Brendan Wallace","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brendan Case","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Berdhal","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Easton R White","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Laurent Hebert-Dufresne","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

Design: A longitudinal, national, multi-centre, retrospective, observational, cohort study was conducted for the first six weeks from March 17, 2020 from start of the national social distancing and then lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 as a comparative baseline. Setting: Hospitals from seven major urban cities were recruited around the UK, including London, representing a comprehensive national picture of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown at its peak. Participants: A total of 4840 clinical encounters were initially recorded. Exclusion criterion consisted of spinal pathology only. Post-exclusion, 4668 clinical encounters were recorded and analysed within the two timeframes. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes included the number of acute trauma referrals and those undergoing operative intervention, patient demographics, mortality rates, and the proportion of patients contracting COVID-19. Secondary outcomes consisted of the mechanism of injury, type of operative intervention and proportion of aerosolising-generating anaesthesia utilised. Demographics for each patient was recorded along with underlying medical co-morbidities. Sub-group analysis compared mortalities between both cohorts. Statistical analyses included mean (+\/-SD), risk and odds ratios, as well as Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance (p = 0.05). Results: During the COVID-19 period there was a 34% reduction in acute orthopaedic trauma referrals compared to 2019 (1792 down to 1183 referrals), and 29.5% less surgical interventions (993 down to 700 operations). The mortality rate significantly (both statistically and clinically) more than doubled for both risk and odds ratios during the COVID period in all referrals (1.3% vs 3.8%, p=0.0005) and in those undergoing operative intervention (2.2% vs 4.9%, p=0.004). Moreover, mortality due to COVID-related complications (versus non-COVID causes) had greater odds by a factor of at least 20 times. The odds ratios of road traffic accidents, sporting injuries, infection, and lower limb injuries were significantly less (by a third to a half) during the COVID period; albeit, the odds of sustaining neck of femur fractures and having falls <1.5m increased by more than 50%. For the operative cohorts, there was a greater odds of aerosolising-generating anaesthesia (including those with superimposed regional blocks) by three-quarters as well as doubling of the odds of a Consultant acting as the primary surgeon. Nevertheless, the odds of open reduction and internal fixation reduced by a quarter whereas removal of metalwork or foreign bodies reduced by three-quarters. Six-week Kaplan-Meier survival probability analysis confirmed those patients with neck of femur fracture and pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease were most at risk of mortality during the COVID-19 era. Conclusion: Although there was a reduction of acute trauma referrals and those undergoing operative intervention, the mortality rate still more than doubled in odds during the peak of the pandemic compared to the same time interval one year ago. Elderly patients with neck of femur fractures and existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities were at the highest risk stratification for mortality. This was the first national study to assess impact of COVID-19 pandemic on acute Orthopaedic trauma and it will aid clinicians in counselling trauma patients of the increased risk of mortality during the era of COVID-19 as well as acting as a risk-prediction tool influencing policymaking as the pandemic continues with potential subsequent waves. Further studies after the lifting of the lockdown are also required to observe for return of standard practice.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kapil Sugand","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"- COVERT Collaborative","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Brendan Case","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Berdhal","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Easton R White","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Laurent Hebert-Dufresne","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

The intervention control measures evaluated include use of negative pressure (NP) treatment rooms and xenon pulsed ultraviolet (XP-UV) infection control equipment. After projecting COVID-19 hospitalizations, a Hospital Energy Model and Infection De-escalation Models are applied to quantify increases in energy demand and reductions in secondary infections. The scope of the interventions consisted of implementing NP in 11, 22, and 44 rooms (at small, medium, and large hospitals) while the XP-UV equipment was used eight, nine, and ten hours a day, respectively. The annum kilowatt-hours (kWh) for NP (and costs were at $0.1015 per kWh) were 116,700 ($11,845), 332,530 ($33,752), 795,675 ($80,761) for small, medium, and large hospitals ($1,077, $1,534, $1,836 added annum energy cost per NP room). For XP-UV, the annum kilowatt-hours and costs were 438 ($45), 493 ($50), 548 ($56) for small, medium, and large hospitals. There are other initial costs associated with the purchase and installation of the equipment, with XP-UV having a higher initial cost. XP-UV had a greater reduction in secondary COVID-19 infections in large and medium hospitals. NP rooms had a greater reduction in secondary SARS-CoV-2 transmission in small hospitals. Early implementation of interventions can result in realized cost savings through reduced hospital-acquired infections.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marietta M.

However, recently after analyzing Covid 19 cases in the US researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, London school of economics and IZA Institute of Labor Economics conclude that the spread of Covid 19 is not linked with population density. Here we investigate the influence of population density on Covid 19 spread and related mortality in the context of India. After a detailed correlation and regression analysis of infection and mortality rates due to Covid 19 at the district level we find moderate association between Covid 19 spread and population density.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arunava Bhadra","author_inst":"University of North Bengal"},{"author_name":"Arindam Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of North Bengal"},{"author_name":"Kabita Sarkar","author_inst":"Swami Vivekananda Institute of Science Technology"},{"author_name":"Arnesh Telukdarie","author_inst":"University of Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Takeru Igusa","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Easton R White","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Laurent Hebert-Dufresne","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

Successful elimination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus will require an effective vaccine. However, the immune correlates of infection are currently poorly understood. While neutralizing antibodies are believed to be essential for protection against infection, the contribution of the neutralizing antibody response to resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been defined. In this study the antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid proteins were investigated in a UK patient cohort, using optimised immunoassays and a retrovirus-based pseudotype entry assay. It was discovered that in severe COVID-19 infections an early antibody response to both antigens was associated with improved prognosis of infection. While not all SARS-CoV-2-reactive sera were found to possess neutralizing antibodies, neutralizing potency of sera was found to be greater in patients who went on to resolve infection, compared with those that died from COVID-19. Furthermore, viral genetic variation in spike protein was found to influence the production of neutralizing antibodies. Infection with the recently described spike protein variant 614G produced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies when compared to viruses possessing the 614D variant. These findings support the assertion that vaccines targeting generation of neutralizing antibodies may be useful at limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment of the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 at time of diagnosis will be a useful addition to the diagnostic toolkit, enabling stratification of clinical intervention for severe COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick J Tighe","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, The University of Nottingham,

contained in China. In this paper, we evaluated the effectiveness of different containment strategies in halting the pandemic spread in both short- and long-term. We combined a networked metapopulation SEIR model featuring undocumented infections, actual mobility data and Bayesian inference to simulate the counterfactual outbreak scenarios removing each one or a combination of the following three policies in place: i) city lockdowns, ii) intercity travel bans, and iii) testing, detection, and quarantine. Our estimates revealed that 11.4% [95% credible interval (CI): 9.7-13.0%] of the infected cases were unidentified before January 23, 2020. The rate grew to 92.5% [95% credible interval (CI): 85.9-94.5%] in early March, thanks to the boost in coronavirus testing capacity. We show that increasing the detection rate of infections from 11.4% to 92.5% alone would explain 75% of the reduction in infections from a no-policy baseline by March 15, 2020. The most pronounced policy implication is that city lockdowns appeared to be the more effective intervention in the short-run but effective testing is essential in containing the COVID-19 spread in the long run. By March 15, restoring within-city personal contact to its 2019 level would lead to a 678% growth in infections with all the other interventions remaining unaffected. Removing intercity travel restrictions and effective detection measures would lead to 3% and 477% growth, respectively. Extending the time horizon to July 15, the counterfactual increase in infections would become 581%, 3% and 30000% had the three classes of interventions been lifted individually.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yatang Lin","author_inst":"HKUST"},{"author_name":"Fangyuan Peng","author_inst":"HKUST"},{"author_name":"Lucy

and well-being. The COVID-19 lockdown worldwide resulted in controls on anthropogenic emission that have a significant synergistic effect on air quality ecosystem services (ESs). This study utilised both satellite and surface monitored measurements to estimate air pollution for 20 cities across the world. Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data were used for evaluating tropospheric air quality status during the lockdown period. Surface measurement data were retrieved from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, USA) for a more explicit assessment of air quality ESs. Google Earth Engine TROPOMI application was utilised for a time series assessment of air pollution during the lockdown (1 Feb to 11 May 2020) compared with the lockdown equivalent periods (1 Feb to 11 May 2019). The economic valuation for air pollution reduction services was measured using two approaches: (1) median externality value coefficient approach; and (2) public health burden approach. Human mobility data from Apple (for city-scale) and Google (for country scale) was used for examining the connection between human interferences on air quality ESs. Using satellite data, the spatial and temporal concentration of four major pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and the aerosol index (AI) were measured. For NO2, the highest reduction was found in Paris (46%), followed by Detroit (40%), Milan (37%), Turin (37%), Frankfurt (36%), Philadelphia (34%), London (34%), and Madrid (34%), respectively. At the same time, a comparably lower reduction of NO2 is observed in Los Angeles (11%), Sao Paulo (17%), Antwerp (24%), Tehran (25%), and Rotterdam (27%), during the lockdown period. Using the adjusted value coefficients, the economic value of the air quality ESs was calculated for different pollutants. Using the public health burden valuation method, the highest economic benefits due to the reduced anthropogenic emission (for NO2) was estimated in US$ for New York (501M $), followed by London (375M $), Chicago (137M $), Paris (124M $), Madrid (90M $), Philadelphia (89M $), Milan (78M $), Cologne (67M $), Los Angeles (67M $), Frankfurt (52M $), Turin (45M $), Detroit (43M $), Barcelona (41M $), Sao Paulo (40M $), Tehran (37M $), Denver (30M $), Antwerp (16M $), Utrecht (14 million $), Brussels (9 million $), Rotterdam (9 million $), respectively. In this study, the public health burden and median externality valuation approaches were adopted for the economic valuation and subsequent interpretation. This one dimension and linear valuation may not be able to track the overall economic impact of air pollution on human welfare.
