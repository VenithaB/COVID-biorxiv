Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to identify functional categories and biochemical pathways. GO and KEGG results suggested that several biological pathways such as \"Fatty acid metabolism\" and \"Cilium morphogenesis\" are mostly involved in the development of COVID-19. Moreover, several genes are critical for virus invasion and adhesion including FLOC, DYNLL1, FBXL3, and FBXW11 and show significant differences in COVID-19 patients.

Thanks to the rapid work of Chinese scientists, the pathogen now called SARS-CoV-2 has been identified and its whole genome has been deposited in public databases by early January 2020. The availability of the genome has allowed researchers to develop Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which are now the gold-standard for molecular diagnosis of the respiratory syndrome COVID19. Because of the rising number of cases and rapid spreading, the world has been facing a shortage of RT-PCR supplies, especially the ones involved in RNA extraction. This has been a major bottleneck to increase testing capacity in many countries that do not significantly manufacture these supplies (Brazil included). Additionally, RT-PCR scalability is highly dependent on equipment that usually perform testing of 96 samples at a time. In this work, we describe a cost-effective molecular NGS-based test for diagnosis of COVID19, which uses a single-step RNA extraction and presents high scalability and accuracy when compared to the gold-standard RT-PCR. A single run of the NGS-based test using the Illumina NextSeq 550 mid-end sequencing equipment is able to multiplex 1,536 patient samples, providing individual semi-qualitative results (detected, not detected). Detected results are provided with fragments per million (FPM) values, which was demonstrated to correlate with RT-PCR Cycle Threshold (CT) values. Besides, usage of the high-end Illumina Novaseq platform may yield diagnostic for up to 6,144 samples in a single run. Performance results when compared with RT-PCR show general accuracy of 96% (or 98% when only samples with CT values for gene N lower than 30 are considered). We have also developed an online platform, called VarsVID, a Varstation feature, to help test executors to easily scale testing numbers. Sample registering, wet-lab worksheets, sample sheet for sequencing and results display are all features provided by VarsVID on Varstation. Altogether, these results will contribute to control COVID19 pandemics.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernanda de Mello Malta","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Deyvid Emanuel Amgarten","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Felipe Camilo Val","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Rubia Anita Ferraz Santana","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Murilo Castro Cervato","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Bruna Mascaro Cordeiro de Azevedo","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Marcela de Souza Basqueira","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Camila Oliveira dos Santos Alves","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Maria Soares Nobrega","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Joao Renato Rebello Pinho","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171033","rel_title":"Post-exertion oxygen saturation as a prognostic factor for adverse outcome in patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19: Observational cohort study","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171033","rel_abs":"Background Measurement of post-exertion oxygen saturation has been proposed to assess illness severity in suspected COVID-19 infection. We aimed to determine the accuracy of post-exertional oxygen saturation for predicting adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19. Methods We undertook an observational cohort study across 70 emergency departments during first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. We collected data prospectively, using a standardised assessment form, and retrospectively, using hospital records, from patients with suspected COVID-19, and reviewed hospital records at 30 days for adverse outcome (death or receiving organ support). Patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded were selected for this analysis. Results We analysed data from 817 patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded after excluding 54 in whom measurement appeared unfeasible. The c-statistic for post-exertion change in oxygen saturation was 0.589 (95% confidence interval 0.465 to 0.713), and the positive and negative likelihood ratios of a 3% or more desaturation were respectively 1.78 (1.25 to 2.53) and 0.67 (0.46 to 0.98). Multivariable analysis showed that post-exertion oxygen saturation was not a significant predictor of adverse outcome when baseline clinical assessment was taken into account (p=0.368). Secondary analysis excluding patients in whom post-exertion measurement appeared inappropriate resulted in a c-statistic of 0.699 (0.581 to 0.817), likelihood ratios of 1.98 (1.26 to 3.10) and 0.61 (0.35 to 1.07), and some evidence of additional prognostic value on multivariable analysis (p=0.019). Conclusions Post-exertion oxygen saturation provides modest prognostic information in the assessment of patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steve Goodacre","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ben Thomas","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ellen Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Laura Sutton","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Katie Biggs","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Carl Marincowitz","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Amanda Loban","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Simon Waterhouse","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Richard Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Wythenshawe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.244996","rel_title":"Pleiotropic effect of Lactoferrin in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection: in vivo, in silico and in vitro preliminary evidences","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.244996","rel_abs":"The current treatments against SARS-CoV-2 have proved so far inadequate.

Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines\/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.\n\nAuthors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claude Kwe Yinda","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Julia R Port","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Trenton J Bushmaker","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Irene Offei Owusu","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Victoria A Avanzato","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Robert J Fischer","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Jonathan E Schulz","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Myndi G Holbrook","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Madison J Hebner","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Tina Thomas","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Andrea Marzi","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Sonja M Best","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Carl Shaia","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Neeltje van Doremalen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Luca Coppeda","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Andrea Magrini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Nicola Moricca","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Stefano Sabatini","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Felice Rosapepe","author_inst":"Pineta Grande Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Bartoletti","author_inst":"Fimmg"},{"author_name":"Sergio Bernardini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Piera Valenti","author_inst":"University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Luca Bianchi","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.245993","rel_title":"Common low complexity regions for SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes as potential multidirectional risk factor in vaccine development","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.245993","rel_abs":"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 demands immediate response from the scientific communities. Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome\/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development. These findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions.\n\nAuthor summaryThe outbreak of the COVID-19 disease affects humans all over the globe. More and more people get sick and many die because of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. The whole machinery of this pathogen is enclosed in a short sequence of nucleotides, building blocks for both RNA and DNA strands. This RNA virus encodes less than 30 protein sequences that change the fate of our societies. Its proteins are composed of 20 amino acids (building bricks) that are usually used quite freely by proteins. However, there are fragments where only one or a few amino acids are used. We name those low complexity regions (LCRs). We invented the first programmes able to compare such LCRs. Using this new methodology we were able to show similarity of some viral proteins to human ones. This discovery has a serious implication when designing vaccines or drugs. It means that companies should not use these very LCRs as targets because it may trigger an autoimmune disease. On the other hand this specific similarity may suggest some kind of disguise of viral proteins into the machinery of human cells.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aleksandra Gruca","author_inst":"Politechnika Slaska"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ziemska-Legiecka","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics"},{"author_name":"Patryk Jarnot","author_inst":"Politechnika Slaska"},{"author_name":"Elzbieta Sarnowska","author_inst":"Centrum Onkologii-Instytut im Marii Sklodowskiej-Curie w Warszawie"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Sarnowski","author_inst":"Polska Akademia Nauk Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki"},{"author_name":"Marcin Grynberg","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jonathan E Schulz","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Myndi G Holbrook","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Madison J Hebner","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Tina Thomas","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Andrea Marzi","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Sonja M Best","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Carl Shaia","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Neeltje van Doremalen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Luca Coppeda","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Andrea Magrini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Nicola Moricca","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Stefano Sabatini","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Felice Rosapepe","author_inst":"Pineta Grande Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Bartoletti","author_inst":"Fimmg"},{"author_name":"Sergio Bernardini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Piera Valenti","author_inst":"University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Luca Bianchi","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.246678","rel_title":"Opposing activities of IFITM proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.246678","rel_abs":"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infections by many viruses, but a subset of IFITMs enhance infections by specific coronaviruses through currently unknown mechanisms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by expression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, restriction of SARS-CoV-2 occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation sites, indicating a restrictive capacity that is distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the human IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting Yxx{Phi} motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which reportedly increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of infection. In sum, these data uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal virus restriction. Indeed, the net effect of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infections may be a result of these opposing activities, suggesting that shifts in the balance of these activities could be coopted by viruses to escape this important first line innate defense mechanism.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guoli Shi","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Adam D Kenney","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Elena Kudryashova","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Lizhi Zhang","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Luanne Hall-Stoodley","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Robinson","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Dmitri Kudryashov","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Alex A.

The immense damage done to public health and economies has prompted a global race for cures and vaccines. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by adding two proline substitutions at the top of the central helix (S-2P). To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th-1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens with up to 50 g of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018\/alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tsun-Yung Kuo","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology and Animal Science, National Ilan University, Yilan County, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Meei-Yun Lin","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Robert L Coffman","author_inst":"Dynavax Technologies, Emeryville, CA 94608, USA"},{"author_name":"John D Campbell","author_inst":"Dynavax Technologies, Emeryville, CA 94608, USA"},{"author_name":"Paula Traquina","author_inst":"Dynavax Technologies, Emeryville, CA 94608, USA"},{"author_name":"Yi-Jun Lin","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Luke Tzu Chi Liu","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Jinyi Cheng","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yu-Chi Wu","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chung-Chin Wu","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Wei-Hsuan Tang","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chung-Guei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuo-Chien Tsao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles Chen","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan; Adjunct Professor of College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, U"},{"author_name":"Neeltje van Doremalen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Luca Coppeda","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Andrea Magrini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Nicola Moricca","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Stefano Sabatini","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Felice Rosapepe","author_inst":"Pineta Grande Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Bartoletti","author_inst":"Fimmg"},{"author_name":"Sergio Bernardini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Piera Valenti","author_inst":"University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Luca Bianchi","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.244632","rel_title":"Bioinformatic Analysis Reveals That Some Mutations May Affect On Both Spike Structure Damage and Ligand Binding Site","rel_date":"2020-08-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.244632","rel_abs":"There are some mutations are known related to SARS-CoV-2.

Especially in Asia, more than one mutation(three different mutations are found in QLA46612 isolated from South Korea) was seen in the same sequence. Although I detected a huge number of mutations (more than seventy in Asia) by regions, some of them were predicted that damage spikes protein structure by using bioinformatic tools.The predicted results are G75V(isolated from North America), T95I(isolated from South Korea), G143V(isolated from North America), M177I(isolated Asia), L293M(isolated from Asia), P295H(isolated from Asia), T393P(isolated from Europe), P507S(isolated from Asia), D614G(isolated from all regions) respectively.

To implement this strategy, we developed a cloud computing architecture, Serratus, tailored for ultra-high throughput sequence alignment at the petabase scale. From this search, we identified and assembled thousands of CoV and CoV-like genomes and genome fragments ranging from known strains to putatively novel genera. We generalise this strategy to other viral families, identifying several novel deltaviruses and huge bacteriophages. To catalyse a new era of viral discovery we made millions of viral alignments and family identifications freely available to the research community. Expanding the known diversity and zoonotic reservoirs of CoV and other emerging pathogens can accelerate vaccine and therapeutic developments for the current pandemic, and help us anticipate and mitigate future ones.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert C Edgar","author_inst":"Independent Scientist"},{"author_name":"Jeff Taylor","author_inst":"Independent Scientist"},{"author_name":"Tomer Altman","author_inst":"Altman Analytics LLC"},{"author_name":"Pierre Barbera","author_inst":"Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Meleshko","author_inst":"St. Petersburg State University"},{"author_name":"Victor Lin","author_inst":"Independent Scientist"},{"author_name":"Dan Lohr","author_inst":"Independent Scientist"},{"author_name":"Gherman Novakovsky","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Basem Al-Shayeb","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jill Banfield","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Anton Korobeynikov","author_inst":"St. Petersburg State University"},{"author_name":"Rayan Chikhi","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Artem Babaian","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles Chen","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan; Adjunct Professor of College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, U"},{"author_name":"Neeltje van Doremalen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Luca Coppeda","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Andrea Magrini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Nicola Moricca","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Stefano Sabatini","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Felice Rosapepe","author_inst":"Pineta Grande Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Bartoletti","author_inst":"Fimmg"},{"author_name":"Sergio Bernardini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Piera Valenti","author_inst":"University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Luca Bianchi","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.02.20129767","rel_title":"A Classification Approach for Predicting COVID-19 Patient Survival Outcome with Machine Learning Techniques","rel_date":"2020-08-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.02.20129767","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is an infectious disease discovered after the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is still becoming an increasing global threat to public health. The virus has been escalated to many countries across the globe. This paper analyzed and compared the performance of three different supervised machine learning techniques; Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on COVID-19 dataset. The best level of accuracy between these three algorithms was determined by comparison of some metrics for assessing predictive performance such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, Kappa index, and ROC. From the analysis results, RF was found to be the best algorithm with 100% prediction accuracy in comparison with LDA and SVM with 95.2% and 90.9% respectively. Our analysis shows that out of these three classification models RF predicts COVID-19 patient's survival outcome with the highest accuracy. Chi-square test reveals that all the seven features except sex were significantly correlated with the COVID-19 patient's outcome (P-value < 0.005). Therefore, RF was recommended for COVID-19 patient outcome prediction that will help in early identification of possible sensitive cases for quick provision of quality health care, support and supervision.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdulhameed Ado Osi","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Hussaini Garba Dikko","author_inst":"Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria"},{"author_name":"Mannir Abdu","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Auwalu Ibrahim","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Lawan Adamu Isma'il","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Hassan Sarki","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Usman Muhammad","author_inst":"Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Abubakar Suleiman","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Safiya Sada Sani","author_inst":"Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria"},{"author_name":"Muftahu Zubairu Ringim","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Anton Korobeynikov","author_inst":"St. Petersburg State University"},{"author_name":"Rayan Chikhi","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Artem Babaian","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles Chen","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan; Adjunct Professor of College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, U"},{"author_name":"Neeltje van Doremalen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Luca Coppeda","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Andrea Magrini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Nicola Moricca","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Stefano Sabatini","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Felice Rosapepe","author_inst":"Pineta Grande Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Bartoletti","author_inst":"Fimmg"},{"author_name":"Sergio Bernardini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Piera Valenti","author_inst":"University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Luca Bianchi","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.242677","rel_title":"High throughput detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using COVIDSeq next generation sequencing","rel_date":"2020-08-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.242677","rel_abs":"The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals globally has necessitated sensitive and high-throughput approaches for the diagnosis, surveillance and for determining the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the COVIDSeq approach for detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis suggests that COVIDSeq could be a potential high sensitivity assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, with an additional advantage of enabling genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul C.

identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019 in Hubei Province, China, and quickly spread throughout the world; so far, it has caused more than 18 million cases of disease and 700,000 deaths. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by means of molecular-based assays, such as real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological assays aimed at detecting different classes of antibodies constitute the best surveillance strategy for gathering information on the humoral immune response to infection and the spread of the virus through the population, in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of novel future vaccines and medicines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human serum samples by means of different commercial and in-house ELISA kits, in order to evaluate and compare their results first with one another and then with those yielded by functional assays using wild-type virus. It is important to know the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies in order to predict population immunity and possible cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and to identify potentially infectious subjects. In addition, in a small sub-group of samples, we performed a subtyping Immunoglobulin G ELISA. Our data showed an excellent statistical correlation between the neutralization titer and the IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA response against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, confirming that antibodies against this portion of the virus spike protein are highly neutralizing and that the ELISA Receptor-Binding Domain-based assay can be used as a valid surrogate for the neutralization assay in laboratories which do not have Biosecurity level-3 facilities.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Livia Mazzini","author_inst":"Vismederi S.r.l."},{"author_name":"Donata

that is unique in modern history. Despite early identification of ACE2 as the receptor for viral spike protein, much remains to be understood about the molecular events behind viral dissemination. We evaluated the contribution of C-type lectin receptors (CLRS) of antigen-presenting cells, widely present in air mucosa and lung tissue. DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, Langerin and MGL bind to diverse glycans of the spike using multiple interaction areas. Using pseudovirus and cells derived from monocytes or T-lymphocytes, we demonstrate that while virus capture by the CLRs examined does not allow direct cell infection, DC\/L-SIGN, among these receptors, promote virus transfer to permissive ACE2+ cells. A glycomimetic compound designed against DC-SIGN, enable inhibition of this process. Thus, we described a mechanism potentiating viral capture and spreading of infection. Early involvement of APCs opens new avenues for understanding and treating the imbalanced innate immune response observed in COVID-19 pathogenesis","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michel Thepaut","author_inst":"Univ.

a rising death toll. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) to redirect host translation machinery to the viral RNA by binding to the ribosome and suppressing cellular, but not viral, protein synthesis through yet unknown mechanisms. We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the transcriptome in human cells. The changes include repression of major gene clusters in ribosomal RNA processing, translation, mitochondria function, cell cycle and antigen presentation; and induction of factors in transcriptional regulation. We further gained a mechanistic understanding of the Nsp1 function by determining the cryo-EM structure of the Nsp1-40S ribosomal subunit complex, which shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of the 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that this 48S PIC is nonfunctional due to the incorrect position of the 3 region of the mRNA. Results presented here elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2, provide insight into viral protein synthesis, and furnish a comprehensive understanding of the impacts from one of the most potent pathogenicity factors of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHighlightsORF screen identified Nsp1 as a major cellular pathogenicity factor of SARS-CoV-2\n\nNsp1 broadly alters the gene expression programs in human cells\n\nNsp1 inhibits translation by blocking mRNA entry channel\n\nNsp1 prevents physiological conformation of the 48S PIC","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuai Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Lei Peng","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA; Systems Biology Institute, Yale University, West Haven, CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jonathan J.

SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and\/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Schoof","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Bryan Faust","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Reuben A Saunders","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Smriti Sangwan","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Veronica V Rezelj","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nick Hoppe","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Morgane Boone","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Christian Billesboelle","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Cristina Puchades","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Caleigh M Azumaya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Huong T Kratochvil","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Marcell Zimanyi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ishan Deshpande","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jiahao Liang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sasha Dickinson","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Henry C Nguyen","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Cynthia M Chio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gregory E Merz","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael C Thompson","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Devan Diwanji","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaitlin Schaefer","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Aditya A Anand","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Niv Dobzinski","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Beth Shoshana Zha","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Camille R.

Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domain binders with high affinity toward neutralizing epitopes without the need for high-resolution structural information. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted a known neutralizing site, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified 85 unique VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes within the ACE2 binding site on Spike-RBD. This enabled us to systematically link these VH domains into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These multivalent and bi-paratopic VH constructs showed a marked increase in affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to the standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with half-minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0 nM (180 ng\/mL). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain bound an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, explaining its increased neutralization potency and confirming our original design strategy. Our results demonstrate that targeted selection and engineering campaigns using a VH-phage library can enable rapid assembly of highly avid and potent molecules towards therapeutically important protein interfaces.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colton J.

After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir\/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2.1 We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase.2,3 Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells;4,5 additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA6 and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir7 have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity.8 Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic.

A phase 2 trial conducted to further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac). METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the optimal dose, immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac. A total of 600 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of the trial vaccine at a dose of 3 g\/0.5 mL or 6 g \/0.5mL, or placebo on Day 0,14 schedule or Day 0,28 schedule. For safety evaluation, solicited and unsolicited adverse events were collected after each vaccination within 7 days and 28 days, respectively. Blood samples were taken for antibody assay. RESULTS CoronaVac was well tolerated, and no dose-related safety concerns were observed. Most of the adverse reactions fell in the solicited category and were mild in severity. Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported symptoms. No Grade 3 adverse reaction or vaccine related SAEs were reported. CoronaVac showed good immunogenicity with the lower 3 g dose eliciting 92.4% seroconversion under Day 0,14 schedule and 97.4% under Day 0,28 schedule. 28 days after two-dose vaccination, the Nab levels of individual schedules range from 23.8 to 65.4 among different dosage and vaccination schedules. CONCLUSIONS Favorable safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac was demonstrated on both schedules and both dosages, which support the conduction of phase 3 trial with optimum schedule\/dosage per different scenarios.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan-Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Gang Zeng","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hong-Xing Pan","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chang-Gui Li","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Biao Kan","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ya-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hai-Yan Mao","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qian-Qian Xin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Kai Chu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei-Xiao Han","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Zhen Chen","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Rong Tang","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei-Dong Yin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xin Chen","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xue-Jie Gong","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Yuan-Sheng Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Liu","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guo-Liang Cui","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Cong-Bing Jiang","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suining"},{"author_name":"Heng-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jing-Xin Li","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min-Nan Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Juan Lian","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-Xing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yanxin Liu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaihua Zhang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"David Bulkley","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ming Sun","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amber M Smith","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alexandrea N.

Furthermore, seven Nbs were shown to block interaction of human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with SARS-CoV-2-RBD-variants, bat-SL-CoV-WIV1-RBD and SARS-CoV-1-RBD. Among the seven candidates, Nb11-59 exhibited the highest activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 with ND50 of 0.55 g\/mL. Nb11-59 can be produced on a large-scale in Pichia pastoris, with 20 g\/L titer and 99.36% purity. It also showed good stability profile, and nebulization did not impact its stability.

SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the feces of some Covid-19 patients which suggests the possibility that the virus could additionally be transmitted via the orofecal route. Methods This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of Covid-19. We conduct ongoing searches using LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and Google for Covid-19; assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Where necessary authors are contacted for further details or clarification on the content of their articles. Results We found 59 studies: nine reviews and 51 primary studies or reports (one cohort study also included a review) examining the potential role of orofecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Half (n=29) were done in China. Thirty seven studies reported positive fecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR results (n=1,034 patients). Six studies reported isolating the virus from fecal samples of nine patients, one study isolated the virus from rectal tissue and one laboratory study found that SARS-CoV-2 productively infected human small intestinal organoids. Eleven studies report on fecal samples found in sewage, and two sampled bathrooms and toilets. Conclusions Various observational and mechanistic evidence support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and be shed from the human gastrointestinal tract. Policy should emphasize the importance of strict personal hygiene measures, and chlorine-based disinfection of surfaces in locations where there is presumed or known SARS-CoV-2 activity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carl Heneghan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Spencer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jon Brassey","author_inst":"Trip Database"},{"author_name":"Tom Jefferson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peng Qiao","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiaofei Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology,  Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yanmin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Yadong Chen","author_inst":"School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Weiwei Ji","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hao Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Huanhuan Cao","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xionghui Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yakun Wan","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Yuan-Sheng Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Liu","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guo-Liang Cui","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Cong-Bing Jiang","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suining"},{"author_name":"Heng-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jing-Xin Li","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min-Nan Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Juan Lian","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-Xing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yanxin Liu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaihua Zhang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"David Bulkley","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ming Sun","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amber M Smith","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alexandrea N.

The potential of SARS-CoV-2 evolution to create novel dangerous variants remains underexplored. Thus, we passaged SARS-CoV-2 in defined conditions and determined its genomic adaptation dynamics. We demonstrate the presence of remarkably stable SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies. We further show that the quasispecies nature of the virus population ensured rapid adaptation of the spike PRRARS motif upon passaging in Vero cells. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 replication in TMPRSS2 expressing cells led to a reverse mutation at the same site. We observed the emergence of novel mutations in envelope protein upon virus culture in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells. Finally, we show that the heparan sulfate-binding motif (PRRARS) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein acted as a determinant of negative growth selection. Overall, our research has far-reaching implications for development of antiviral strategies, suggesting viral quasispecies may facilitate rapid emergence of escape mutants under selection pressure, such as the treatment with antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M.

While much has been learned in the first months of the pandemic, many features of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be determined. For example, anosmia is a common presentation and many patients with this finding show no or only minor respiratory signs. Studies in animals experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, provide opportunities to study aspects of the disease not easily investigated in human patients. COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic to lethal. Most experimental infections provide insights into mild disease. Here, using K18-hACE2 mice that we originally developed for SARS studies, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes severe disease in the lung, and in some mice, the brain. Evidence of thrombosis and vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. Further, we show that infusion of convalescent plasma (CP) from a recovered COVID-19 patient provided protection against lethal disease. Mice developed anosmia at early times after infection. Notably, while treatment with CP prevented significant clinical disease, it did not prevent anosmia. Thus K18-hACE2 mice provide a useful model for studying the pathological underpinnings of both mild and lethal COVID-19 and for assessing therapeutic interventions.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stanley Perlman","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Jian Zheng","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"LOK YIN ROY WONG","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Kun Li","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Abhishek K Verma","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Miguel E Ortiz Bezara","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Christine Wohlford-Lenane","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Mariah R.
