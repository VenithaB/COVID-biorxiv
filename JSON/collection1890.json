SARS-CoV-2 belongs to an order of Nidovirales with very large RNA genomes. It is proposed that the fidelity of CoV genome replication is aided by an RNA nuclease complex, formed of non-structural proteins 14 and 10 (nsp14-nsp10), an attractive target for antiviral inhibition. Here, we confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex is an RNase. Detailed functional characterisation reveals nsp14-nsp10 is a highly versatile nuclease capable of digesting a wide variety of RNA structures, including those with a blocked 3-terminus. We propose that the role of nsp14-nsp10 in maintaining replication fidelity goes beyond classical proofreading and purges the nascent replicating RNA strand of a range of potentially replication terminating aberrations. Using the developed assays, we identify a series of drug and drug-like molecules that potently inhibit nsp14-nsp10, including the known Sars-Cov-2 major protease (Mpro) inhibitor ebselen and the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir, revealing the potential for bifunctional inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hannah T Baddock","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sanja Brolih","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuliana Yosaatmadja","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Malitha Ratnaweera","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marcin Bielinski","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lonnie Swift","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Abimael Cruz-Migoni","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Garrett M Morris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Schofield","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Opher Gileadi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter J McHugh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.243220","rel_title":"Rapid endothelialitis and vascular inflammation characterise SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human lung-on-chip model","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.243220","rel_abs":"BackgroundSevere manifestations of COVID-19 include hypercoagulopathies and systemic endothelialitis. The underlying dynamics of damage to the vasculature, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of immune cell mediated cytokine storms is unknown. This is in part because in vitro infection models are typically monocultures of epithelial cells or fail to recapitulate vascular physiology.\n\nMethodsWe establish a vascularised lung-on-chip infection model consisting of a co-culture of primary human alveolar epithelial cells ( epithelial) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( endothelial), with the optional addition of CD14+ macrophages to the epithelial side. A combination of qRT-PCR, RNAscope, immunofluorescence, and ELISA measurements are used to study the dynamics of viral replication and host responses to a low dose infection of SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the apical surface of the epithelial face maintained at an air-liquid interface.\n\nFindingsSARS-CoV-2 inoculation does not lead to a productive amplification of infectious virions. However, both genomic and antisense viral RNA can be found in endothelial cells within 1-day post infection (dpi) and persist upto 3 dpi. This generates an NF-KB inflammatory response typified by IL-6 secretion and a weak antiviral interferon response even in the absence of immune cells. Endothelial inflammation leads to a progressive loss of barrier integrity, a subset of cells also shows a transient hyperplasic phenotype. Administration of Tocilizumab slows the loss of barrier integrity but does not reduce the occurrence of the latter.\n\nInterpretationEndothelial infection can occur through basolateral transmission from infected epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammation occurs despite the lack of rapid viral replication and the consequences are cell-type dependent. Infected endothelial cells might be a key source of circulating IL-6 in COVID-19 patients. Vascular damage occurs independently of immune-cell mediated cytokine storms, whose effect would only exacerbate the damage.\n\nFindingCore support from EPEL.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vivek V Thacker","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Kunal Sharma","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Neeraj Dhar","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Gian-Filippo Mancini","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Jessica Sordet-Dessimoz","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"John D McKinney","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Abimael Cruz-Migoni","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Garrett M Morris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Schofield","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Opher Gileadi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter J McHugh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20172643","rel_title":"The impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission across 130 countries and territories","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20172643","rel_abs":"Introduction: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to reduce transmission of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. Methods: We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission with data from January - June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in Rt, levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. Results: There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced Rt. Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support and debt\/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g., restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on <10 people gathering was). Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Conclusion: Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications taking into account these effects, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many although not all the actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christian Morgenstern","author_inst":"Informed Portfolio Management"},{"author_name":"James Kelly","author_inst":"Informed Portfolio Management"},{"author_name":"Rachel Lowe","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Abimael Cruz-Migoni","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Garrett M Morris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Schofield","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Opher Gileadi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter J McHugh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20173195","rel_title":"The Build-Up of Droplet\/Aerosols Carrying the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, in Confined Spaces","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20173195","rel_abs":"A model of the distribution of respiratory droplets and aerosols by Lagrangian turbulent air-flow is developed and used to show how the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus can be dispersed by the breathing of an infected person.

Since testing was not widespread early in the pandemic in the U.S., I do not use data on confirmed cases and rely solely on public fatality data to estimate model parameters. Fits to the first 20 days of data determine a degenerate combination of the basic reproduction number, R0, and the mean time to removal from the infectious population, 1\/{gamma} with {gamma}(R0 - 1) = 0.25(0.21) inverse days for NYC (Cook County). Equivalently, the initial doubling time was td = 2.8(3.4) days for NYC (Cook). The early fatality data suggest that both locations had infections in early February. I model the mitigation measures implemented in mid-March in both locations (distancing, quarantine, isolation, etc) via a time-dependent reproduction number Rt that declines monotonically from R0 to a smaller asymptotic value, with a parameterized functional form. The timing (mid-March) and duration (several days) of the transitions in Rt appear well determined by the data. However, the fatality data determine only a degenerate combination of the parameters R0, the percentage reduction in social contact due to mitigation measures, X, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), f . With flat priors, based on simulations the NYC model parameters have 95.45% credible intervals of R0 = 3.0 - 5.4, X = 80 - 99.9% and f = 2 - 6%, with 5 - 13% of the population asymptotically infected. A strong external prior indicating a lower value of f or of 1\/{gamma} would imply lower values of R0 and X and higher percentage infection of the population. For Cook County, the evolution was qualitatively different: after mitigation measures were implemented, the daily fatality counts reached a plateau for about a month before tailing off. This is consistent with an SIR model that exhibits \"critical slowing-down\", in which Rt plateaus at a value just above unity. For Cook County, the 95.45% credible intervals for the model parameters are much broader and shifted downward, R0 = 1.4 - 4.7, X = 26 - 54%, and f = 0.1 - 0.6% with 15 - 88% of the population asymptotically infected. Despite the apparently lower efficacy of its social contact reduction measures, Cook County has had significantly fewer fatalities per population than NYC, D{infty}\/N = 100 vs. 270 per 100,000. In the model, this is attributed to the lower inferred IFR for Cook; an external prior pointing to similar values of the IFR for the two locations would instead chalk up the difference in D\/N to differences in the relative growth rate of the disease. I derive a model-dependent threshold, Xcrit, for \"safe\" re-opening, that is, for easing of contact reduction that would not trigger a second wave; for NYC, the models predict that increasing social contact by more than 20% from post-mitigation levels will lead to renewed spread, while for Cook County the threshold value is very uncertain, given the parameter degeneracies. The timing of 2nd-wave growth will depend on the amplitude of contact increase relative to Xcrit and on the asymptotic growth rate, and the impact in terms of fatalities will depend on the parameter f .","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua Frieman","author_inst":"Fermilab"},{"author_name":"Luiza Angheluta","author_inst":"Njord Center, Dept. of Physics, Univ. of Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"James Kelly","author_inst":"Informed Portfolio Management"},{"author_name":"Rachel Lowe","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Abimael Cruz-Migoni","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Garrett M Morris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Schofield","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Opher Gileadi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter J McHugh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171561","rel_title":"Low awareness of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy adults","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171561","rel_abs":"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic challenges governments worldwide to balance appropriate virus control measures and their societal and economic consequences. These control measures include the identification, isolation and testing of potentially infected individuals. As this relies on an individual's awareness of infection, we investigated the extent to which healthy adults suspected having had COVID-19, and how COVID-19 suspicion and symptoms relate to antibodies indicative of a past infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods and findings Individuals donating plasma anywhere in the Netherlands between May 11th and 18th were screened for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA and invited to participate in an online questionnaire about COVID-19-related symptoms and awareness. Antibody and questionnaire data were complete for 3,676 individuals, including 239 (6.5%) that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Here, we show that a 38% of the individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies reported having had no or only very mild symptoms at any time during the peak of the epidemic. The loss of taste and\/or smell in particular was significantly associated with seropositivity, independent of age and sex. Forty-eight percent of antibody-positive persons did not suspect having had COVID-19, in spite of most of them reporting symptoms. Conclusions Awareness of infection was low among individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, even at the peak of the epidemic. Improved awareness and recognition of COVID-19 symptoms and tracing of asymptomatic contacts is crucial to halting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katja van den Hurk","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Eva-Maria Merz","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Femmeke J.

Here we report follow-up serological analysis in these care homes five weeks later. Methods: Residents and staff had a convalescent blood sample for SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and neutralising antibodies by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR five weeks after the primary COVID-19 outbreak investigation. Results: Of the 518 residents and staff in the initial investigation, 208\/241 (86.3%) surviving residents and 186\/254 (73.2%) staff underwent serological testing. Almost all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive residents and staff were antibody positive five weeks later, whether symptomatic (residents 35\/35, 100%; staff, 22\/22, 100%) or asymptomatic (residents 32\/33, 97.0%; staff 21\/22, 95.1%).

How these agents impact patients with cancer who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Methods We retrospectively investigated associations between SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure or death with receipt of the aforementioned medications and with pre-COVID-19 neutropenia. The study included all cancer patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center until June 2, 2020 (N=820). We controlled for cancer-related characteristics known to predispose to worse COVID-19. To address that more acutely ill patients receive therapeutic corticosteroids, we examined patient subsets based on different levels of respiratory support: <=2 L\/min supplemental oxygen, >2L\/min supplemental oxygen, and advanced respiratory support prior to death. Results Corticosteroid administration was associated with worse outcomes in the pre-2L supplemental oxygen cohort; no statistically significant difference was observed in the >2L\/min supplemental oxygen and post-critical cohorts. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were lower, and ferritin levels were higher, after corticosteroid administration. In patients with metastatic thoracic cancer, 9 of 25 (36%) and 10 of 31 (32%) had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive immunotherapy, respectively. Seven of 23 (30%) and 52 of 187 (28%) patients with hematologic cancer had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive anti-CD20 therapy, respectively. Chemotherapy itself was not associated with worse outcomes, but pre-COVID-19 neutropenia was associated with worse COVID-19 course. Relative prevalence of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia in previous studies may account for different conclusions regarding the risks of chemotherapy in patients with COVID-19. In the absence of prospective studies and evidence-based guidelines, our data may aid providers looking to assess the risks and benefits of these agents in caring for cancer patients in the COVID-19 era.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin Jee","author_inst":"MSKCC"},{"author_name":"Aaron J Stonestrom","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sean Devlin","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Teresa Nguyentran","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Wills","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Varun Narendra","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Michael B Foote","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Lumish","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Santosha Vardhana","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Stephen Pastores","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Neha Korde","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Dhwani Patel","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Steven Horwitz","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Scordo","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Felicity Aiano","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karthik Paranthaman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ma","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Saavedra-Campos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171637","rel_title":"Hospital length of stay for severe COVID-19: implications for Remdesivir's value","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171637","rel_abs":"Remdesivir has been granted emergency use authorization for treatment of severe COVID-19. Remdesivir's pricing is based on a presumed reduction of hospital length of stay (LOS) by four days. But the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) that suggested this treatment benefit excluded patients who were expected to be discharged within 72 hours. Perhaps as a result, median time to recovery was unusually long in both arms of the study (15 days vs 11 days). Remdesivir requires a 5-day inpatient stay, so patients who would otherwise be discharged in fewer than 5 days may remain hospitalized to complete treatment while patients who would be discharged between 5 and 8 days, would only have potential reductions in their hospital LOS of 0-3 days. In a retrospective analysis of 1643 adults with severe COVID-19 admitted to Columbia University Medical Center and the Allen community hospital between March 9, 2020 and April 23, 2020, median hospital LOS was 7 (3-14) days. Five-hundred and eighty-six patients (36%) had a LOS of 1-4 days, 384 (23%) had a LOS of 5-8 days, and 673 (41%) were hospitalized for greater than or equal to 9 days. Remdesivir treatment may not provide the LOS reductions that the company relied on when pricing the therapy: 36% of the cohort would need to have LOS prolonged to receive a 5-day course, and only 41% of patients in our cohort had LOS of 9 days or more, meaning they could have their LOS shortened by 4 days and still receive a full Remdesivir course. Further investigation of shorter treatment courses and programs to facilitate outpatient intravenous Remdesivir administration are needed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michaela Anderson","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter Bach","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Matthew R Baldwin","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Teresa Nguyentran","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Wills","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Varun Narendra","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Michael B Foote","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Lumish","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Santosha Vardhana","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Stephen Pastores","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Neha Korde","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Dhwani Patel","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Steven Horwitz","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Scordo","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Felicity Aiano","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karthik Paranthaman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ma","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Saavedra-Campos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171744","rel_title":"Underdetection of COVID-19 cases in France in the exit phase following lockdown","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171744","rel_abs":"A novel testing policy was implemented in May in France to systematically screen potential COVID-19 infections and suppress local outbreaks while lifting lockdown restrictions. 20,736 virologically-confirmed cases were reported in mainland France from May 13, 2020 (week 20, end of lockdown) to June 28 (week 26). Accounting for missing data and the delay from symptom onset to confirmation test, this corresponds to 7,258 [95% CI 7,160-7,336] cases with symptom onset during this period, a likely underestimation of the real number. Using age-stratified transmission models parameterized to behavioral data and calibrated to regional hospital admissions, we estimated that 69,115 [58,072-77,449] COVID-19 symptomatic cases occurred, suggesting that 9 out of 10 cases with symptoms were not ascertained. Median detection rate increased from 7% [6-9]% to 31% [28-35]% over time, with regional estimates varying from 11% (Grand Est) to 78% (Normandy) by the end of June. Healthcare-seeking behavior in COVID-19 suspect cases remained low (31%) throughout the period. Model projections for the incidence of symptomatic cases (4.5 [3.9-5.0] per 100,000) were compatible with estimates integrating participatory and virological surveillance data, assuming all suspect cases consulted. Encouraging healthcare-seeking behavior and awareness in suspect cases is critical to improve detection. Substantially more aggressive and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a pandemic-fighting tool. These elements should be considered in light of the currently observed resurgence of cases in France and other European countries.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Laura Di Domenico","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Chiara E Sabbatini","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Valdano","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e9ment Turbelin","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Marion Debin","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Caroline Guerrisi","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Charly Kengne-Kuetche","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9cile Souty","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hanslik","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Thierry Blanchon","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Yves Bo\u00eblle","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Julie Figoni","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Vaux","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Christine Camp\u00e8se","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Sibylle Bernard-Stoecklin","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ma","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Saavedra-Campos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171850","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey among 18,000 healthcare and administrative personnel at hospitals, pre-hospital services, and specialist practitioners in the Central Denmark Region","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171850","rel_abs":"Objectives: The objective of this study was to perform a large seroprevalence survey on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among Danish healthcare workers to identify high risk groups. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: All healthcare workers and administrative personnel at the seven hospitals, pre-hospital services and specialist practitioner clinics in the Central Denmark Region were invited by e-mail to be tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by a commercial SARS-CoV-2 total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Participants: A total of 25,950 participants were invited. Of these, 17,987 (69%) showed up for blood sampling, and 17,971 had samples available for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Main outcome measures: 1) Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; 2) Risk factors for seropositivity; 3) Association of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. Results: After adjustment for assay sensitivity and specificity, the overall seroprevalence was 3.4% (CI: 2.5%-3.8%). The seroprevalence was higher in the western part of the region than in the eastern part (11.9% vs 1.2%, difference: 10.7 percentage points, CI: 9.5-12.2). In the high prevalence area, the emergency departments had the highest seroprevalence (29.7%) while departments without patients or with limited patient contact had the lowest seroprevalence (2.2%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis with age, sex, and profession as the predictors showed that nursing staff, medical doctors, and biomedical laboratory scientists had a higher risk than medical secretaries, who served as reference (OR = 7.3, CI: 3.5-14.9; OR = 4., CI: 1.8-8.9; and OR = 5.0, CI: 2.1-11.6, respectively). Among the total 668 seropositive participants, 433 (64.8%) had previously been tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 50.0% had a positive RT-PCR result. A total of 98% of individuals who had a previous positive viral RNA test were also found to be seropositive. Conclusions: We found large differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in staff working in the healthcare sector within a small geographical area of Denmark and signs of in-hospital transmission. Half of all seropositive staff had been tested positive by PCR prior to this survey. This study raises awareness of precautions which should be taken to avoid in-hospital transmission. Additionally, regular testing of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered to identify areas with increased transmission. Trial registration: The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (1-16-02-207-20).","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanne Jespersen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thomas Greve","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Kathrine Agergaard Kaspersen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital & Danish Big Data Centre for Environment and Health (BERTHA), Aarhus University, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Martin Tolstrup","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital & Danish Big Data Centre for Environment and Health (BERTHA), Aarhus University, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jacob Dvinge Redder","author_inst":"Business Intelligence, Central Denmark Region, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Kent Nielsen","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Medicine, Herning Regional Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anders Moensted Abildgaard","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Albert Kolstad","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lars Oestergaard","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Marianne Kragh Thomsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Holger Jon Moeller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Christian Erikstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital & Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Christine Camp\u00e8se","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Sibylle Bernard-Stoecklin","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ma","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Saavedra-Campos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171884","rel_title":"On the track of the D839Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike fusion peptide: emergence and geotemporal spread of a highly prevalent variant in Portugal","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171884","rel_abs":"Mutations in the Spike motif predicted to correspond to the fusion peptide are considered of interest as this domain is a potential target for anti-viral drug development that plays a pivotal role in inserting SARS-CoV-2 into human cell membranes. We tracked the temporal and geographical spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with the Spike D839Y mutation in the fusion peptide, which was detected early during the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. We show that this variant was most likely imported from Italy in mid-late February 2020, becoming prevalent in the Northern and Central regions of Portugal, where represented 22% and 59% of the sampled genomes, respectively, until the end of April 2020. Based on our high sequencing sampling during the early epidemics [15,5% (1275\/8251) and 6,0% (1500\/24987) of all confirmed cases until the end of March and April, respectively)], we estimate that, between March 14th and April 9th (covering the exponential phase of the epidemic), the relative frequency of Spike Y839 variant increased at a rate of 12.1% (6.1%-18.2%, CI 95%) at every three days, being potentially associated with one in each four (20.8-29.7%, CI 95%) COVID-19 cases in Portugal during the same period. This observation places the Spike Y839 variant in the origin of the largest SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain during the first month of the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. We hypothesize that population\/epidemiological effects (founder effects) and enhanced selective advantage might have concomitantly contributed to the increasing frequency trajectory of the Spike Y839 variant. Screening of the D839Y mutation globally confirmed its detection in 12 additional countries, even though the huge differences in genome sampling between countries hampers any accurate estimate of D839Y global frequency. In summary, our data points out that SARS-CoV-2 Spike Y839 variants, namely the descendent variant of the globally spread G614 variant detected in Portugal, need continuous and close surveillance.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"V\u00edtor Borges","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Joana Isidro","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Helena Cortes-Martins","author_inst":"Reference and Surveillance Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"S\u00edlvia Duarte","author_inst":"Innovation and Technology Unit, Department of Human Genetics, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Lu\u00eds Vieira","author_inst":"Innovation and Technology Unit, Department of Human Genetics, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Leite","author_inst":"Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\u00eancia (IGC), Oeiras, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Isabel Gordo","author_inst":"Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\u00eancia (IGC), Oeiras, Portugal."},{"author_name":"Constantino P.

Currently, though convalescent individuals have been shown with both cellular and humoral immune responses, there is very limited understanding on the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses, in patients with severe COVID-19. Here, we examined 10 blood samples from COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The majority of them (70%) mounted SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity with production of neutralizing antibodies. However, compared to healthy controls, the percentages and absolute numbers of both NK cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced, accompanied with decreased IFNg expression in CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood from severe patients. Most notably, we failed in detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNg production by peripheral blood lymphocytes from these patients. Our work thus indicates that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms are associated with defective cellular immunity, which not only provides insights on understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, but also has implications in developing an effective vaccine to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ling Ni","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine,Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Meng-Li Cheng","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu Feng","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jingyuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases,"},{"author_name":"Fang Ye","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Qing Ye","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Gengzhen Zhu","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pengzhi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jing Shao","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong-qiang Deng","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Cheng-feng Qin","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171439","rel_title":"Extended SEIQR type model for COVID-19 epidemic and data analysis","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171439","rel_abs":"An extended SEIQR type model is considered in order to model the COVID-19 epidemic.

The fitting of data shows that the actual level of this coefficient in some European countries is about 0.1, characterizing a slow disease progression. A slight increase of this value in the autumn can lead to a strong epidemic burst.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swarnali Sharma","author_inst":"Vijaygarh Jyotish Ray College, Kolkata, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Vitaly Volpert","author_inst":"Institut Camille Jordan, UMR 5208 CNRS, University Lyon 1, 69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Malay Banerjee","author_inst":"IIT Kanpur"},{"author_name":"Yu Feng","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jingyuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases,"},{"author_name":"Fang Ye","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Qing Ye","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Gengzhen Zhu","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pengzhi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jing Shao","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong-qiang Deng","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Cheng-feng Qin","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171454","rel_title":"Stochastic extinction of epidemics: how long does would it take for Sars-Cov-2 to die out?","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171454","rel_abs":"Worldwide, we are currently in an unprecedented situation with regard to the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic, where countries are using isolation and lock-down measures to control the spread of infection. This is a scenario generally not much anticipated by previous theory, and in particular, there has been little attention paid to the question of extinction as a means to eradicate the virus; the prevailing view appears to be that this is unfeasible without a vaccine. We use a simple well-mixed stochastic SIR model as a basis for our considerations, and calculate a new result, using branching process theory, for the distribution of times to extinction. Surprisingly, the distribution is an extreme value distribution of the Gumbel type, and we show that the key parameter determining its mean and standard deviation is the expected rate of decline Re = {gamma}(1-Re) of infections, where {gamma} is the rate of recovery from infection and Re is the usual effective reproductive number. The result also reveals a critical threshold number of infected I&#134 = 1\/(1-Re), below which stochastic forces dominate and need be considered for accurate predictions. As this theory ignores migration between populations, we compare against a realistic spatial epidemic simulator and simple stochastic simulations of sub-divided populations with global migration, to find very comparable results to our simple predictions; in particular, we find global migration has the effect of a simple upwards rescaling of Re with the same Gumbel extinction time distribution we derive from our non-spatial model. Within the UK, using recent estimates of I0{approx}37000 infected and Re= 0.9, this model predicts a mean extinction time of 616{+\/-}90 days or approximately ~2 years, but could be as short as 123{+\/-}15 days, or roughly 4 months for Re = 0.4. Globally, the theory predicts extinction in less than 200 days, if the reproductive number is restricted to Re < 0.5. Overall, these results highlight the extreme sensitivity of extinction times when Re approaches 1 and the necessity of reducing the effective reproductive number significantly (Re<{approx}0.5) for relatively rapid extinction of an epidemic or pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhavin S Khatri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Vitaly Volpert","author_inst":"Institut Camille Jordan, UMR 5208 CNRS, University Lyon 1, 69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Malay Banerjee","author_inst":"IIT Kanpur"},{"author_name":"Yu Feng","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jingyuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases,"},{"author_name":"Fang Ye","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Qing Ye","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Gengzhen Zhu","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pengzhi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jing Shao","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong-qiang Deng","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Cheng-feng Qin","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171942","rel_title":"High prevalence of symptoms among Brazilian subjects with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: a nationwide household survey","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171942","rel_abs":"Since the beginning of the pandemic of COVID-19, there has been a widespread assumption that most infected persons are asymptomatic. A frequently-cited early study from China suggested that 86% of all infections were undocumented, which was used as indirect evidence that patients were asymptomatic. Using data from the most recent wave of the EPICOVID19 study, a nationwide household-based survey including 133 cities from all states of Brazil, we estimated the proportion of people with and without antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 who were asymptomatic, which symptoms were most frequently reported, the number of symptoms reported and the association between symptomatology and socio-demographic characteristics. We were able to test 33,205 subjects using a rapid antibody test that was previously validated. Information on symptoms was collected before participants received the test result. Out of 849 (2.7%) participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, only 12.1% (95%CI 10.1-14.5) reported no symptoms since the start of the pandemic, compared to 42.2% (95%CI 41.7-42.8) among those who tested negative. The largest difference between the two groups was observed for changes in smell or taste (56.5% versus 9.1%, a 6.2-fold difference). Symptoms change in smell or taste, fever and myalgia were most likely to predict positive test results as suggested by recursive partitioning tree analysis. Among individuals without any of these three symptoms (74.2% of the sample), only 0.8% tested positive, compared to 18.3% of those with both fever and changes in smell or taste. Most subjects with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil are symptomatic, even though most present only mild symptoms.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Maria Baptista Menezes","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Mariangela F Silveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Bernardo L Horta","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Aluisio J D Barros","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Whermeister","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Marilia A Mesenburg","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Lucia C Pellanda","author_inst":"Fundacao Universidade Federal de Ciencias de Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Claudio J Struchiner","author_inst":"Fundacao Getulio Vargas"},{"author_name":"Marcelo N Burattini","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cheng-feng Qin","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20173005","rel_title":"Histopathology of Third Trimester Placenta from SARS-CoV-2-Positive Women","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20173005","rel_abs":"Background: This study aims to investigate whether maternal SARS-CoV-2 status affect placental pathology.

Interestingly, our report shows that household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is high in both adults and children, with similar rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in all age groups, including the younger children. A total of 44 out of 80 household contacts (55%) of index patients had anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG.

On 22 March 2020, amid increasing daily case numbers, the Australian Government implemented lockdown restrictions to help flatten the curve. Our study aimed to understand the impact of lockdown restrictions on sexual and reproductive health. Here we focus on sexual practices. Methods: An online survey was open from the 23 April 2020 to the 11 May 2020. Participants were recruited online via social media and other networks and were asked to report on their sexual practices in 2019 and during lockdown. Logistic regression was used to calculate the difference (including 95% confidence intervals) in the proportion of sex practices between time periods. Results: Of the 1187 who commenced the survey, 965 (81.3%) completed it. Overall 70% were female and 66.3% were aged 18 to 29 years. Most (53.5%) reported less sex during lockdown than in 2019. Compared with 2019, participants were more likely to report sex with a spouse (35.3% vs 41.7%; difference=6.4%; 95%CI: 3.6, 9.2) and less likely to report sex with a girl\/boyfriend (45.1% vs 41.8%; diff=-3.3%; 95%CI: -7.0, -0.4) or with casual hook-up (31.4% vs 7.8%; 95%CI:-26.9, -19.8). Solo sex activities increased, 14.6% (123\/840) reported using sex toys more often and 26.0% (218\/838) reported masturbating more often. Dating app use decreased during lockdown compared with 2019 (42.1% vs 27.3%; difference= -14.8%; 95%CI: -17.6, -11.9). Using dating apps for chatting\/texting (89.8% vs 94.5%; diff=4.7%; 95%CI:1.0, 8.5) and for setting up virtual dates (2.6% vs 17.2%; diff=14.6%; 95%CI:10.1, 19.2) increased during lockdown.

Here, we analyzed publicly available 15,818 assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, along with 2,350 raw sequence datasets sampled worldwide. We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649\/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L; ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness advantageous mutations. Our study provides theoretical support for vaccine development and the optimization of treatment for COVID-19.

In this study, we have focused on the SARS-CoV2 helicase (Nsp13), which is critical for viral replication and the most conserved non-structural protein within the coronavirus family. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics approaches, we generated structural models of the SARS-CoV2 helicase in its apo- and ATP\/RNA-bound conformations. We performed virtual screening of ~970,000 chemical compounds against the ATP binding site to identify potential inhibitors. Herein, we report docking hits of approved human drugs targeting the ATP binding site. Importantly, two of our top drug hits have significant activity in inhibiting purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 helicase, providing hope that these drugs can be potentially repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark A White","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555, USA"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Cheng","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Yin-Qiao Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"Min-Sheng Peng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"David M Irwin","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Haipeng Li","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chin"},{"author_name":"Jian Lu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, Center for Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Yiming Bao","author_inst":"National Genomics Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing 100101, China."},{"author_name":"Xuemei Lu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"Di Liu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Ya-ping Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"Jane S Hocking","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cheng-feng Qin","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.09.20149286","rel_title":"The effect of public health policies in the transmission of COVID-19 for South American countries","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.09.20149286","rel_abs":"Objectives: The analysis of transmission dynamics is crucial to determine whether mitigation or suppression measures reduce the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study sought to estimate the basic (R0) and time-dependent (Rt) reproduction number of COVID-19 and contrast the public health measures for ten South American countries. Methods: Data was obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Country-specific R0 estimates during the first two weeks of the outbreak and Rt estimates after 90 days were estimated. Results: Countries used a combination of isolation, social distancing, quarantine, and community-wide containment measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 at different points in time. R0 ranged from 1.52 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.99) in Venezuela, to 3.83 (3.04-4.75) in Chile, whereas Rt, after 90 days, ranged from 0.71 (95% credible interval: 0.39-1.05) in Uruguay to 1.20 (1.19-1.20) in Brazil. Different R0 and Rt values may be related to the testing capacity of each country. Conclusion: R0 in the early phase of the outbreak varied across the South American countries. The adopted public health measures in the initial period of the pandemic appear to have reduced Rt over time in each country.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bryan Valcarcel","author_inst":"Milken Institute School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jose L Avilez","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"J.

Here, we describe the structure-based design of self-assembling protein nanoparticle immunogens that elicit potent and protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The nanoparticle vaccines display 60 copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) in a highly immunogenic array and induce neutralizing antibody titers roughly ten-fold higher than the prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain trimer despite a more than five-fold lower dose. Antibodies elicited by the nanoparticle immunogens target multiple distinct epitopes on the RBD, suggesting that they may not be easily susceptible to escape mutations, and exhibit a significantly lower binding:neutralizing ratio than convalescent human sera, which may minimize the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. The high yield and stability of the protein components and assembled nanoparticles, especially compared to the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized S trimer, suggest that manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable. These results highlight the utility of robust antigen display platforms for inducing potent neutralizing antibody responses and have launched cGMP manufacturing efforts to advance the lead RBD nanoparticle vaccine into the clinic.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra C Walls","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schaefer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Minh N Pham","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Murphy","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Longping V Tse","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Laila Shehata","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chengbo Chen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mary Jane Navarro","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Miranda","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deleah Pettie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Ravichandran","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"John C Kraft","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cassandra Ogohara","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Anne Palser","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sara Chalk","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"E-Chiang Lee","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Kepl","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cameron M Chow","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Claire Sydeman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Edgar A Hodge","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brieann Brown","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jim T Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Kendra L Gully","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Thomas B Lewis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Miklos Guttman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kelly K Lee","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah H Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

No effective treatment is currently available for severe COVID-19 disease. One strategy for implementing cell-based immunity involves the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology. Unlike CAR T cells, which need to be developed using primary T cells derived from COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia, clinical success of CAR NK cell immunotherapy is possible through the development of allogeneic, universal, and  off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells from a third party, which will significantly broaden the application and reduce costs. Here, we develop a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of CR3022 (henceforth, CR3022-CAR-NK), a broadly neutralizing antibody for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and can be activated by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles in vitro. Further, CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells. Thus,  off-the-shelf CR3022-CAR-NK cells may have the potential to treat patients with severe COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Minh Tuyet Ma","author_inst":"Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Saiaditya Badeti","author_inst":"Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Ke Geng","author_inst":"Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Dongfang Liu","author_inst":"Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Minh N Pham","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Murphy","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Longping V Tse","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Laila Shehata","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chengbo Chen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mary Jane Navarro","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Miranda","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deleah Pettie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Ravichandran","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"John C Kraft","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cassandra Ogohara","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Anne Palser","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sara Chalk","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"E-Chiang Lee","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Kepl","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cameron M Chow","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Claire Sydeman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Edgar A Hodge","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brieann Brown","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jim T Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Kendra L Gully","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Thomas B Lewis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Miklos Guttman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kelly K Lee","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah H Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, the membrane nanoparticles prepared from ACE2-rich cells are discovered with potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane of human embryonic kidney-239T cell highly expressing ACE2 is screened to prepare nanoparticles. The nanomaterial termed HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs contains 265.1 ng mg-1 of ACE2 on the surface and acts as a bait to trap SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to host cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 can translocate to the cytoplasm and affect the cell metabolism, which is also inhibited by HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs. Further studies reveal that HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs can efficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into human proximal tubular cells and block viral infection with a low half maximal inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this biocompatible membrane nanomaterial is sufficient to block the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G-S1 mutant to sensitive cells.

The expression level of ACE2 potentially determine the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, it is thus of importance to understand the regulatory mechanism of ACE2 expression. Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) is known to be involved in multiple processes including antiviral restriction, endogenous retrovirus latency and immune response, it is recently reported to be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 receptor in type II pneumocytes; however, the roles of TRIM28 in ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remain unclear. This study showed that knockdown of TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and increases pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (PAEpiCs). In a co-culture model of NK cells and lung epithelial cells, our results demonstrated that NK cells inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells, which was partially reversed by depletion of interleukin-2 and blocking of granzyme B in the co-culture medium. Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma})-induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating IFN-{gamma} receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in both A549 and PAEpiCs. Importantly, the upregulated ACE2 induced by TRIM28 knockdown and co-culture of NK cells was partially reversed by dexamethasone in A549 cells but not PAEpiCs. Our study identified TRIM28 as a novel regulator of ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yinfang Wang","author_inst":"Central Laboratory, Basic and Translational Vascular Medicine Laboratory, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yingzhe Fan","author_inst":"Central Laboratory, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yitong Huang","author_inst":"Central Laboratory, Basic and Translational Vascular Medicine Laboratory, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tao Du","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zongjun Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dekui Huang","author_inst":"Basic and Translational Vascular Medicine Laboratory, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine and Science, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wang","author_inst":"The Advanced Institute for Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Zhang","author_inst":"Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of TCM"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Wang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Song Wang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Huang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junping Wang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Zhao","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Anne Palser","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sara Chalk","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"E-Chiang Lee","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Kepl","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cameron M Chow","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Claire Sydeman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Edgar A Hodge","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brieann Brown","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jim T Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Kendra L Gully","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Thomas B Lewis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Miklos Guttman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kelly K Lee","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah H Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, MDA5 is activated with K63-linked polyubiquitination and then triggers the recruitment of MAVS and activation of TBK1 and IKK, subsequently leading to IRF3 and NF-{kappa}B phosphorylation. Great numbers of symptomatic and severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading worldwide, and the poor efficacy of treatment with type I interferon and antiviral agents indicates that SARS-CoV-2 escapes from antiviral immune responses via an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 8 (NSP8) acts as an innate immune suppressor and inhibits type I IFN signaling to promote infection of RNA viruses. It downregulates the expression of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines by binding to MDA5 and impairing its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Our findings reveal that NSP8 mediates innate immune evasion during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may serve as a potential target for future therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases.\n\nImportanceThe large-scale spread of COVID-19 is causing mass casualties worldwide, and the failure of antiviral immune treatment suggests immune evasion. It has been reported that several nonstructural proteins of severe coronaviruses suppress antiviral immune responses; however, the immune suppression mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Here, we revealed that NSP8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly blocks the activation of the cytosolic viral dsRNA sensor MDA5 and significantly downregulates antiviral immune responses. Our study contributes to our understanding of the direct immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 by showing that NSP8 suppresses the most upstream sensor of innate immune responses involved in the recognition of viral dsRNA.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ziwei Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Fan Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Peihui Wang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaojuan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Ersheng Kuang","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine and Science, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wang","author_inst":"The Advanced Institute for Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Zhang","author_inst":"Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of TCM"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Wang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Song Wang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Huang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junping Wang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Zhao","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Anne Palser","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sara Chalk","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"E-Chiang Lee","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Kepl","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cameron M Chow","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Claire Sydeman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Edgar A Hodge","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brieann Brown","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jim T Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Kendra L Gully","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Thomas B Lewis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Miklos Guttman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kelly K Lee","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah H Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

In this context, human convalescent plasma has been used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the efficacy remains uncertain. Objective: To explore potential signals of efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Design: Open-label, Expanded Access Program (EAP) for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with human convalescent plasma. Setting: Multicenter, including 2,807 acute care facilities in the US and territories. Participants: Adult participants enrolled and transfused under the purview of the US Convalescent Plasma EAP program between April 4 and July 4, 2020 who were hospitalized with (or at risk of) severe or life threatening acute COVID-19 respiratory syndrome. Intervention: Transfusion of at least one unit of human COVID-19 convalescent plasma using standard transfusion guidelines at any time during hospitalization. Convalescent plasma was donated by recently-recovered COVID-19 survivors, and the antibody levels in the units collected were unknown at the time of transfusion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Seven and thirty-day mortality. Results: The 35,322 transfused patients had heterogeneous demographic and clinical characteristics. This cohort included a high proportion of critically-ill patients, with 52.3% in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 27.5% receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of plasma transfusion. The seven-day mortality rate was 8.7% [95% CI 8.3%-9.2%] in patients transfused within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis but 11.9% [11.4%-12.2%] in patients transfused 4 or more days after diagnosis (p<0.001). Similar findings were observed in 30-day mortality (21.6% vs. 26.7%, p<0.0001). Importantly, a gradient of mortality was seen in relation to IgG antibody levels in the transfused plasma. For patients who received high IgG plasma (>18.45 S\/Co), seven-day mortality was 8.9% (6.8%, 11.7%); for recipients of medium IgG plasma (4.62 to 18.45 S\/Co) mortality was 11.6% (10.3%, 13.1%); and for recipients of low IgG plasma (<4.62 S\/Co) mortality was 13.7% (11.1%, 16.8%) (p=0.048). This unadjusted dose-response relationship with IgG was also observed in thirty-day mortality (p=0.021). The pooled relative risk of mortality among patients transfused with high antibody level plasma units was 0.65 [0.47-0.92] for 7 days and 0.77 [0.63-0.94] for 30 days compared to low antibody level plasma units. Conclusions and Relevance: The relationships between reduced mortality and both earlier time to transfusion and higher antibody levels provide signatures of efficacy for convalescent plasma in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This information may be informative for the treatment of COVID-19 and design of randomized clinical trials involving convalescent plasma.
