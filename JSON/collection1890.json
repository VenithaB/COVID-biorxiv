Protecting medical workers is an important component of public health measures for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Special measures to improve the mental health of medical workers should be based on their needs. Special attention needs to be paid to young medical workers working in areas with a high risk of infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Egor Bachilo","author_inst":"Educational and Research Center of Psychotherapy and Clinical Psychology"},{"author_name":"Juliy Barylnik","author_inst":"SSMU"},{"author_name":"Andrey Shuldyakov","author_inst":"SSMU"},{"author_name":"Alexander Efremov","author_inst":"Energy Technologies"},{"author_name":"Dmitiy Novikov","author_inst":"SSMU"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20162677","rel_title":"An Analysis of Territorial Patterns in COVID-19 Mortality in France, Spain, Italy and the UK","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20162677","rel_abs":"This paper provides an overview of territorial patterns of COVID-19 deaths in four European countries severely affected by the pandemic, Spain, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The analysis focuses on cumulated COVID-19 mortality at the sub-regional level, following the territorial subdivision of countries adopted by the European Union. The paper builds upon a dataset with highly granular information on COVID-19 deaths assembled from various sources. The analysis shows remarkable differences in territorial patterns of COVID-19 mortality, both within and across the four countries reviewed. Results somewhat differ depending on the aspect considered (concentration of deaths or mortality rates) but, in general, Italy, France and Spain display significant territorial disparities, with selected sub-regions being disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Instead, the picture is more uniform in the UK, with comparatively lower differences across the various sub-regions. These findings suggest that analyses of COVID-19 mortality at the national level (and, sometimes, even at the regional level) may conceal major differences and therefore be of limited use, both analytically and from an operational viewpoint.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberto Zavatta","author_inst":"Economisti Associati"},{"author_name":"Juliy Barylnik","author_inst":"SSMU"},{"author_name":"Andrey Shuldyakov","author_inst":"SSMU"},{"author_name":"Alexander Efremov","author_inst":"Energy Technologies"},{"author_name":"Dmitiy Novikov","author_inst":"SSMU"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20161430","rel_title":"Transport effect of COVID-19 pandemic in France","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20161430","rel_abs":"An extension of the classical pandemic SIRD model is considered for the regional spread of COVID-19 in France under lockdown strategies.

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a huge challenge to healthcare systems and their personnel worldwide. The study of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers, through prevalence studies, will let us know viral expansion, individuals at most risk and the most exposed areas. The aim of this study is to gauge the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in our hospital workforce and identify groups and areas at increased risk. Methods and Findings. This is a cross-sectional and longitudinal study carried out on healthcare workers based on molecular and serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 3013 HCW invited to participate, finally 2439 (80.9%) were recruited, including 674 (22.4%) who had previously consulted at the OHS for confirmed exposure and\/or presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. A total of 411 (16.9%) and 264 (10.8%) healthcare workers were SARS-CoV-2 IgG and rRT-PCR positive, respectively. The cumulative prevalence considering all studies (IgG positive HCW and\/or rRT-PCR positive detection) has been 485 (19.9%). SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive patients in whom the virus was not detected were 221 (9.1%); up to 151 of them (68.3%) did not report any compatible symptoms nor consult at the OHS for this reason. Men became more infected than women (25% vs 18.5%, p=0.0009), including when data were also classified by age. COVID-19 cumulative prevalence among the HCW assigned to medical departments was higher (25.2%) than others, as well as among medical staff (25.4%) compared with other professional categories (p<0.01). Conclusions. Global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCW of our centre has been 19.9%. Doctors and medical services personnel have had the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of them have not presented compatible symptoms. This emphasizes the performance of continuous surveillance methods of the most exposed health personnel and not only based on the appearance of symptoms.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier Garralda Fernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Molero Vilches","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Bermejo Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Isabel Cano de Torres","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Elda I Colino Romay","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Isabel Garcia-Arata","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Jeronimo Jaqueti Aroca","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Rosa Lillo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lopez Lacomba","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Luis Mazon Cuadrado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Laura M Molina Esteban","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Luis J Morales Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Laura Moratilla Monzo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Elva Nieto-Borrajo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Maria Pacheco Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Santiago Prieto Menchero","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Cristina Sanchez Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Eva Sanchez Testillano","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Jesus Garcia-Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20044990","rel_title":"Severity detection for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients using a machine learning model based on the blood and urine tests","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20044990","rel_abs":"The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused serious challenges to the human society in China and across the world.

This study utilized the machine learning algorithms to build the COVID-19 severeness detection model. Support vector machine (SVM) demonstrated a promising detection accuracy after 32 features were detected to be significantly associated with the COVID-19 severeness. These 32 features were further screened for inter-feature redundancies. The final SVM model was trained using 28 features and achieved the overall accuracy 0.8148. This work may facilitate the risk estimation of whether the COVID-19 patients would develop the severe symptoms. The 28 COVID-19 severeness associated biomarkers may also be investigated for their underlining mechanisms how they were involved in the COVID-19 infections.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haochen Yao","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenobiology, The Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Chinese Ministry of Education, College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University, Changchun, Ch"},{"author_name":"Nan Zhang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin University, Changchun, China"},{"author_name":"Ruochi Zhang","author_inst":"BioKnow Health Informatics Lab, College of Software, and Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin Univer"},{"author_name":"Meiyu Duan","author_inst":"BioKnow Health Informatics Lab, College of Software, and Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin Univer"},{"author_name":"Tianqi Xie","author_inst":"School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh, 135 N Bellefield Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Pan","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenobiology, The Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Chinese Ministry of Education, College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University, Changchun, Ch"},{"author_name":"Ejun Peng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Huang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenobiology, The Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Chinese Ministry of Education, College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University, Changchun, Ch"},{"author_name":"Yingli Zhang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin University, Changchun, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin University, Changchun, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin University, Changchun, China"},{"author_name":"Fengfeng Zhou","author_inst":"BioKnow Health Informatics Lab, College of Software, and Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin Univer"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenobiology, The Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Chinese Ministry of Education, College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University, Changchun, Ch"},{"author_name":"Elva Nieto-Borrajo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Maria Pacheco Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Santiago Prieto Menchero","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Cristina Sanchez Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Eva Sanchez Testillano","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Jesus Garcia-Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20162842","rel_title":"Association of D-dimer and fibrinogen magnitude with hypercoagulability by thromboelastography in severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20162842","rel_abs":"Introduction: D-dimer concentration has been used to identify candidates for intensified anticoagulant treatment for both venous thromboembolism prevention and mitigation of the microthrombotic complications associated with COVID-19. Thromboelastography (TEG) maximum amplitude (MA) has been validated as an indicator of hypercoagulability and MA [&ge;] 68 mm has been utilized as a marker of hypercoagulability in other conditions. We evaluated the relationship between coagulation, inflammatory, and TEG parameters in patients with COVID-19 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Methods: We performed a single center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients that received ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. TEG, inflammatory, and coagulation markers were compared in patients with and without thrombotic complications. Correlation tests were performed to identify the coagulation and inflammatory markers that best predict hypercoagulability as defined by an elevated TEG MA. Results: 168 TEGs were available in 24 patients. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients that developed a thrombotic event versus those that did not (p=0.038 and p=0.043 respectively). D-dimer was negatively correlated with TEG MA (p<0.001) while fibrinogen was positively correlated (p<0.001). A fibrinogen > 441 mg\/dL had a sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 85.7% for the detection of MA [&ge;] 68 mm. Conclusions: In critically ill patients with COVID-19, D-dimer concentration had an inverse relationship with hypercoagulability as measured by TEG MA. D-dimer elevation may reflect severity of COVID-19 related sepsis rather than designate patients likely to benefit from anticoagulation. Fibrinogen concentration may represent a more useful marker of hypercoagulability in this population.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhimanyu Chandel","author_inst":"Walter Reed National Military Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Saloni Patolia","author_inst":"Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary Looby","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heidi Dalton","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Najeebah Bade","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Khangoora","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mehul Desai","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Lantry","author_inst":"Inoval Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Erik Osborn","author_inst":"Inoval Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Svetolik Djurkovic","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Tang","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steven D Nathan","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher S King","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elva Nieto-Borrajo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Maria Pacheco Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Santiago Prieto Menchero","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Cristina Sanchez Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Eva Sanchez Testillano","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Jesus Garcia-Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20162511","rel_title":"The Pandemics in Artificial Society: Agent-Based Model to Reflect Strategies on COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20162511","rel_abs":"Various social policies and strategies have been deliberated and used within many countries to handle the COVID-19 pandemic.

In response to the COVID-19 epidemic in the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy) a software was developed to standardize data collection and facilitate surveillance of contacts and outbreaks and map the links between bases and contacts. In this paper, we present the results of contact tracing efforts during Phase I of the epidemic (March-April, 2020, mostly under lockdown), including sociodemographic characteristics of contacts who became cases and of the cases who infected one or more contact. Methods A contact tracing website was developed that included components for geolocation and linking of cases and contacts using open source software. Information on community-based confirmed and probable cases and their contacts was centralized on the website. Information on cases came directly from the central case database, information on contacts was collected by telephone interviews following a standard questionnaire. Contacts were followed via telephone, emails, or an app. Results The 2,812 laboratory-diagnosed community cases of COVID-19 had 6,690 community contacts, of whom 890 (13.3%) developed symptoms. Risk of developing symptomatic disease increased with age and was higher in workplace contacts than cohabitants or non-cohabiting family or friends. The greatest risk of transmission to contacts was found for the 14 cases <15 years of age (22.4%); 8 of the 14, who ranged in age from <1 to 11 years) infected 11 of 49 contacts. Overall, 606 outbreaks were identified, 74% of which consisted of only two cases. Discussion The open-source software program permitted the centralized tracking of contacts and rapid identification of links between cases. Workplace contacts were at higher risk of developing symptoms. Although childhood contacts were less likely to become cases, children were more likely to infect household members, perhaps because of the difficulty of successfully isolating children in household settings.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pirous Fateh-Moghadam","author_inst":"Osservatorio per la salute, Dipartimento salute e politiche sociali, Provincia Autonoma di Trento"},{"author_name":"Laura Battisti","author_inst":"Osservatorio per la salute, Dipartimento salute e politiche sociali, Provincia Autonoma di Trento"},{"author_name":"Silvia Molinaro","author_inst":"Servizio di Igiene pubblica, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Azienda per i servizi sanitari di Trento"},{"author_name":"Steno Fontanari","author_inst":"Mpa-solutions"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Dallago","author_inst":"Mpa-solutions"},{"author_name":"Nancy Binkin","author_inst":"Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California"},{"author_name":"Mariagrazia Zuccali","author_inst":"Servizio di Igiene pubblica, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Azienda per i servizi sanitari di Trento"},{"author_name":"James Lantry","author_inst":"Inoval Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Erik Osborn","author_inst":"Inoval Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Svetolik Djurkovic","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Tang","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steven D Nathan","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher S King","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elva Nieto-Borrajo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Maria Pacheco Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Santiago Prieto Menchero","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Cristina Sanchez Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Eva Sanchez Testillano","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Jesus Garcia-Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20149757","rel_title":"Children with COVID-19 like symptoms in Italian Pediatric Surgeries: the dark side of the coin","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20149757","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are nonspecific and shared with other common acute viral illnesses (fever, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, and cutaneous signs), thus making clinical differential diagnosis tricky. In Italy, first line management of pediatric care is handed over to Primary Care Pediatricians (PCPs), who were not allowed to directly perform diagnostic tests during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Without a confirmatory diagnosis, PCPs could only collect information on ''COVID-19 like symptoms'' rather than identify typical COVID-19 symptoms. AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 like symptoms in outpatient children, during Italian lockdown. To provide PCPs a risk score to be used in clinical practice during the differential diagnosis process. METHODS: A survey was submitted to 50 PCPs (assisting 47,500 children) from 7 different Italian regions between the 4th of March and the 23rd of May 2020 (total and partial lockdown period). COVID-19 like symptoms in the assisted children were recorded, as well as presence of confirmed\/suspected cases in children's families, which was taken as proxy of COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression was accomplished to estimate the risk of having suspected\/confirmed cases in families, considering symptoms as potential determinants. RESULTS: 2,300 children (4.8% of overall survey population) fell ill with COVID-19 like symptoms, 3.1% and 1.7% during total and partial lockdown period respectively. The concurrent presence of fatigue, cough, and diarrhea in children, in absence of sore throat\/earache and abnormal skin signs, represents the maximum risk level of having a suspected\/confirmed case of COVID-19 at home. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of children presenting COVID-19 like symptoms at home has been remarkable also during the total lockdown period. The present study identified a pattern of symptoms which could help, in a cost-effective perspective, PCPs in daily clinical practice to define priorities in addressing children to the proper diagnostic procedure.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianfranco Trapani","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Sanremo (IM), Italy"},{"author_name":"Vassilios Fanos","author_inst":"Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Enrico Bertino","author_inst":"Neonatal Care Unit, Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giulia Maiocco","author_inst":"Neonatal Care Unit, Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Osama Al Jamal","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Cagliari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Fiore","author_inst":"Primary Care Pediatrician, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"VIncenzo Bembo","author_inst":"Primary Care Pediatrician, Frosinone, Italy"},{"author_name":"Domenico Careddu","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Novara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lando Barberio","author_inst":"Primary Care Pediatrician, Taggia (IM), Italy"},{"author_name":"Luisella Zanino","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Verlato","author_inst":"Unit of Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Department of Diagnostics & Public Health, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Steven D Nathan","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher S King","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elva Nieto-Borrajo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Maria Pacheco Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Santiago Prieto Menchero","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Cristina Sanchez Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Eva Sanchez Testillano","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Jesus Garcia-Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20162057","rel_title":"Predicting PPE use, post-traumatic stress, and physical symptoms during the early weeks of COVID-19 lockdowns in the USA","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20162057","rel_abs":"Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic combined with inconsistent governmental and public health recommendations, media communications emphasizing threat, and widespread lockdowns created a complex psychological environment for Americans. In this study, 450 MTurk workers completed measures of (a) risk for COVID-19, (b) perceived vulnerability to disease, (c) intolerance of uncertainty, (d) mindfulness, (e) COVID-19 preventive health behaviors, (f) post-Trauma symptoms, and (g) stress related physical symptoms. The surveys were completed between April 9, 2020 and April 18, 2020 which is a period that corresponded to the first 2-3 weeks of lockdown for most participants. A substantial number of participants reported a reduction employment status and 69% were in self-isolation. The participants reported a high degree of perceived vulnerability with 68% indicating they felt there was a 50\/50 chance or greater they would contract COVID-19. Mask wearing was variable: 16% not at all, 20% some of the time, 42% a good part of the time, and 26% most of the time. Using clinical cutoff on the post-trauma scale, 70% of the sample would be considered to have symptoms consistent with PTSD. The mean level of physical symptoms was significantly (p < .001) and substantially higher (d = 1.46) than norms. PPE use was positively associated with level of education and mindfulness nonreactivity and negatively associated with age, having a current medical condition, and mindfulness nonjudgment. Post trauma and physical health symptoms were strongly predicted by susceptibility variables and intolerance of uncertainty.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William H OBrien","author_inst":"Bowling Green State University"},{"author_name":"Shan Wang","author_inst":"Duke Kunshan University"},{"author_name":"Aniko Viktoria Varga","author_inst":"Bowling Green State University"},{"author_name":"Huanzhen Xu","author_inst":"Bowling Green State University"},{"author_name":"Tracy E Sims","author_inst":"Bowling Green State University"},{"author_name":"Kristin A Horan","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Chung Xiann Lim","author_inst":"Bowling Green State University"},{"author_name":"Domenico Careddu","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Novara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lando Barberio","author_inst":"Primary Care Pediatrician, Taggia (IM), Italy"},{"author_name":"Luisella Zanino","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Verlato","author_inst":"Unit of Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Department of Diagnostics & Public Health, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Steven D Nathan","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher S King","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elva Nieto-Borrajo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Maria Pacheco Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Santiago Prieto Menchero","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Cristina Sanchez Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Eva Sanchez Testillano","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"},{"author_name":"Jesus Garcia-Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20156836","rel_title":"Modeling the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 deposition in the respiratory tract mimicked by the 11C radionuclide","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20156836","rel_abs":"The knowledge on the deposition and retention of the viral particle of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract during the very initial intake from the ambient air is of prime importance to understand the infectious process and COVID-19 initial symptoms.

We estimated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among blood donors in Kenya. Methods We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG prevalence by ELISA on residual blood donor samples obtained between April 30 and June 16, 2020. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 83% (95% CI 59, 96%) and 99.0% (95% CI 98.1, 99.5%), respectively. National seroprevalence was estimated using Bayesian multilevel regression and post-stratification to account for non-random sampling with respect to age, sex and region, adjusted for assay performance. Results Complete data were available for 3098 of 3174 donors, aged 15-64 years. By comparison with the Kenyan population, the sample over-represented males (82% versus 49%), adults aged 25-34 years (40% versus 27%) and residents of coastal Counties (49% versus 9%). Crude overall seroprevalence was 5.6% (174\/3098). Population-weighted, test-adjusted national seroprevalence was 5.2% (95% CI 3.7, 7.1%). Seroprevalence was highest in the 3 largest urban Counties; Mombasa (9.3% [95% CI 6.4, 13.2%)], Nairobi (8.5% [95% CI 4.9, 13.5%]) and Kisumu (6.5% [95% CI 3.3, 11.2%]). Conclusions We estimate that 1 in 20 adults in Kenya had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the study period. By the median date of our survey, only 2093 COVID-19 cases and 71 deaths had been reported through the national screening system. This contrasts, by several orders of magnitude, with the numbers of cases and deaths reported in parts of Europe and America when seroprevalence was similar.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sophie Uyoga","author_inst":"KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Ifedayo M.O.

Our diagnostic laboratory faced a rapid increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, with up to 1,007 tests per day. To maintain a rapid turnaround time to support patient management and public health authorities' decisions, we moved from a case-by-case validation of RT-PCR to an automated validation and immediate transmission of the results to clinicians. To maintain high quality and to track possible aberrant results, we developed a quality-monitoring tool based on a homemade algorithm coded in R. We present the results of this quality-monitoring tool applied to 35,137 RT-PCR results corresponding to 30,198 patients. Patients tested several times led to 4,939 pairwise comparisons; 88% concordant and 12% discrepant. Among the 573 discrepancies, 428 were automatically solved by the algorithm. The most likely explanation for these 573 discrepancies was related for 44.9% of the situations to \"Clinical evolution\", 27.9% to \"Preanalytical\" problems, and 25.3% to \"Stochastic\". Finally, 11 discrepant results could not be explained, including 8 received from external partners for which clinical data were not available. The implemented quality-monitoring strategy allowed to: i) assist the investigation of discrepant results ii) focus the attention of medical microbiologists onto results requiring a specific expertise and iii) maintain an acceptable TAT. This work highlighted the high RT-PCR consistency for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and the importance of automated processes to handle a huge number of samples while preserving quality.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linda Mueller","author_inst":"University Hospital of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Valentin Scherz","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Gilbert Greub","author_inst":"University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Katia Jaton","author_inst":"University of Lausanne and University Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Onya Opota","author_inst":"University Hospital of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Perpetual Wanjiku","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Rashid Aman","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya"},{"author_name":"Mercy Mwangangi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya"},{"author_name":"Patrick Amoth","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya"},{"author_name":"Kadondi Kasera","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya"},{"author_name":"Wangari Ng'ang'a","author_inst":"Presidential Policy & Strategy Unit, The Presidency, Government of Kenya"},{"author_name":"Charles Rombo","author_inst":"Kenya National Blood Transfusion Services"},{"author_name":"Christine K.

Here we compare qRT-PCR with DETECTR to diagnose COVID-19 on 378 patient samples and report a 95% reproducibility. Patient sample dilution assays suggest a higher analytical sensitivity of DETECTR compared to qRT-PCR, however, this was not confirmed in a large patient cohort. The data showed that both techniques are equally sensitive in detecting SARS-CoV-2 providing an added value of DETECTR to the currently used qRT-PCR platforms. For DETECTR, different gRNAs can be used simultaneously to obviate negative results due to mutations in N-gene. Lateral flow strips, suitable as a point of care test (POCT), showed a 100% correlation to the high-throughput DETECTR assay. Importantly, DETECTR was 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 and did not detect other human coronaviruses. As there is no need for specialized equipment, DETECTR could be rapidly implemented as a complementary technically independent approach to qRT-PCR thereby increasing the testing capacity of medical microbiological laboratories and relieving the existent PCR-platforms for routine non- SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eelke Brandsma","author_inst":"Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, Amsterdam University Medical Center,  University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematopoiesis, Amsterdam, The Netherla"},{"author_name":"Han JMP Verhagen","author_inst":"Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, Amsterdam University Medical Center,  University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematopoiesis, Amsterdam, The Netherla"},{"author_name":"Thijs J.W. van de Laar","author_inst":"Medical Microbiology, Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Eric C.J.

Here we investigated the relationship between average number of transmissions though time, the reproductive number Rt, and social distancing index as reported by mobile phone data service inloco, for Goias State, Brazil, between March and June 2020. We calculated Rt values using EpiEstim package in R-plataform for confirmed cases incidence curves. We found a correlation equal to -0.72 between Rt values for confirmed cases and isolation index at a time lag of 8 days. As the Rt values were paired with center of the moving window of 7 days, the delay matches the mean incubation period of the virus. Our findings reinforce that isolation index can be an effective surrogate for modeling and epidemiological analyses and, more importantly, can be an useful metrics for anticipating the need for early interventions, a critical issue in public health.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Jardim Sr.","author_inst":"INCT EECBio; Universidade Federal de Goias"},{"author_name":"Jose Alexandre Diniz-Filho Sr.","author_inst":"UFG"},{"author_name":"Thiago Fernando Rangel Sr.","author_inst":"Depto Ecologia ICB UFG"},{"author_name":"Cristiana Maria Toscano II","author_inst":"IPTSP, UFG"},{"author_name":"Janami Steenkamp","author_inst":"PathCare Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Douglas B Kell","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Asier Antonana-Vildosola","author_inst":"CIC bioGUNE"},{"author_name":"Chiara Bruzzone","author_inst":"CIC bioGUNE"},{"author_name":"Maider Bizkarguenaga","author_inst":"CIC bioGUNE"},{"author_name":"Nieves Embade","author_inst":"CIC bioGUNE"},{"author_name":"Nicola G A Abrescia","author_inst":"CIC bioGUNE"},{"author_name":"Jose M.

Objective: To examine if age, sex, race\/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions is independently associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: 70 counties within 12 states participating in the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) and a population-based sample of non-hospitalized adults residing in the COVID-NET catchment area from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Participants: U.S. community-dwelling adults ([&ge;]18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, March 1- June 23, 2020. Measurements: Adjusted rate ratios (aRR) of hospitalization by age, sex, race\/ethnicity and underlying medical conditions (hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of stroke, diabetes, obesity [BMI [&ge;]30 kg\/m2], severe obesity [BMI[&ge;]40 kg\/m2], chronic kidney disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Results: Our sample included 5,416 adults with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. Adults with (versus without) severe obesity (aRR:4.4; 95%CI: 3.4, 5.7), chronic kidney disease (aRR:4.0; 95%CI: 3.0, 5.2), diabetes (aRR:3.2; 95%CI: 2.5, 4.1), obesity (aRR:2.9; 95%CI: 2.3, 3.5), hypertension (aRR:2.8; 95%CI: 2.3, 3.4), and asthma (aRR:1.4; 95%CI: 1.1, 1.7) had higher rates of hospitalization, after adjusting for age, sex, and race\/ethnicity. In models adjusting for the presence of an individual underlying medical condition, higher hospitalization rates were observed for adults [&ge;]65 years, 45-64 years (versus 18-44 years), males (versus females), and non-Hispanic black and other race\/ethnicities (versus non-Hispanic whites). Limitations: Interim analysis limited to hospitalizations with underlying medical condition data. Conclusion: Our findings elucidate groups with higher hospitalization risk that may benefit from targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean Y.

A case study is conducted using a large urban region, Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. Results are intended to serve as a planning guide for public health decision-makers. Methods: The simulation model mimics the daily social mixing behavior of the susceptible and infected generating the spread. Data representing demographics of the region, virus epidemiology, and social interventions shapes model behavior. Results include daily values of infected, reported, hospitalized, and dead. Results: Study results show that stay-at-home order is quite effective in flattening and then reversing the case growth curve subsiding the pandemic with only 5.8% of the population infected. Whereas, following the current Phase II reopening plan could end the pandemic via herd immunity with 75% people infected. Use of surgical variety face masks reduced infected by 20%. A further reduction of 66% was achieved through contact tracing. Conclusions: For Miami-Dade County, a strategy comprising mandatory use of face masks and aggressive contact tracing to identify 50% of the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic, if adopted now, can potentially steer the COVID-19 pandemic to subside within next 3 months with approximately one-fifth of the population infected.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanisha Tatapudi","author_inst":"Industrial and Management Systems Engineering, University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Rachita Das","author_inst":"Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida"},{"author_name":"Tapas K.

Understanding the risk factors for poor outcomes of COVID-19 is thus important for successful management and control of the pandemic. However, the progress and severity of the epidemic across different regions show great differentiations. We hypothesized the origination of these differences are based on location-dependent variations in underlying population-wide health factors. Disease prevalence or incidence data of states and counties of the United States were collected for a group of chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, physical inactivation, and common cancers (e.g., lung, colorectal, stomach, kidney and renal). Correlation and regression analysis identified the prevalence of heart failure as a significant positive factor for region-level COVID-19 mortality. Similarly, the incidence of gastric cancer and thyroid cancer were also identified as significant factors contributing to regional variation in COVID-19 mortality. To explore the implications of these results, we re-analyzed the RNA-seq data for stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) and colon carcinoma (COAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We found that expression of genes in the immune response pathways were more severely disturbed in STAD than in COAD, implicating higher probability for STAD patients or individuals with precancerous chronic stomach diseases to develop cytokine storm once infected with COVID-19. Taken together, we conclude that location variations in particular chronic diseases and cancers contribute significantly to the regional variations in COVID-19 mortality.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongxing Yang","author_inst":"Merck Holding (China), a business of Merck KGaA"},{"author_name":"Fei Zhong","author_inst":"MilliporeSigma, a business of KGaA"},{"author_name":"Tapas K.

No study has been conducted assessing the psychological impact of this pandemic on the general public in Nepal. The objective of this study is to assess the mental health status during COVID 19 outbreak and explore the potential influencing factors among the population attending the hospital fever clinics with COVID 19 symptoms. Methods: A cross sectional survey was conducted between May to June, 2020 with a sample of 645 participants aged 18 and above in 26 hospitals across Nepal. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire along with a validated psychometric tool, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS21) scale. The metrics and scores of symptoms and their severity were created and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of potential covariates with outcome variables. Results: The prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress were 14%, 7% and 5% respectively. Participants from Bagmati province reported higher level of anxiety (OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.42 10.59), while stress (OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.09 21.29) and depressive symptoms (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.10 10.35) observed higher among the participants in Province 1. Women were more at risk of anxiety (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.21 8.20) and depression (2.75, 95% CI 1.16 6.51) than men. Similarly, people with primary level education found more prone to all factors, stress (OR 20.35, 95% CI 2.06 201.19), anxiety (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.24 7.91), and depression (OR 4.41, 95% CI 1.29 15.07). More farmers than labors showed higher odds (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.01 5.01) for anxiety, while individuals surveyed who reported their health status as poor-had higher odds (OR 5.95, 95% CI 1.08 32.68) for depression. Also, people currently living in rented houses reported more stress (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.07 9.05) and those living far from family reported higher rates of depressive symptoms (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.01 12.58). Conclusion: The study identified increased prevalence of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the initial stage of COVID 19 pandemic in Nepal. Considering the findings, there is urgent need to develop and implement appropriate community-based mental health programs targeting individuals who have had COVID 19 symptoms and who are prone to develop adverse mental health outcomes.

Longitudinal assessment of mental health during Covid-19 in a representative population-based sample, however, is currently largely missing. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in perceived stress levels and depressive symptoms measured before and during Covid-19 pandemic in a representative population-based sample. Methods: Baseline data on stress levels and depressive symptoms from a well-established population-based sample were compared with those obtained from self-administered e-questionnaires distributed during Covid-19 pandemic. A total of 715 participants completed e-questionnaires. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test repeated-measure differences, while between-group differences were analysed using Mann-Whitney and the Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Perceived stress levels and depressive symptoms increased 1.4 and 5.5 times, respectively, during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the time prior Covid-19. Changes in stress and depressive symptoms were most significant in females and did not depend on whether one quarantined alone or with others. Feeling of loneliness during Covid-19 pandemic had the greatest impact on increased stress levels and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: This population-based longitudinal study showed that Covid-19 related measures had significant impact on mental health in a general population with the feeling of loneliness identified as the biggest risk factor. This impact indicates the need of timely and tailored treatment of mental health disorders and integration of preventive mental health measures into global public health policies to protect mental health during future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan Sebastian Novotny","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Pablo Gonzalez Rivas","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarka Kunzova","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Skladana","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anna Pospisilova","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anna Polcrova","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jose R Medina Inojosa","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Francisco Lopez-Jimenez","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yonas E Geda","author_inst":"Barrow Neurological Institute"},{"author_name":"Gorazd B Stokin","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sue Kim","author_inst":"Michigan Department of Health and Human Services"},{"author_name":"Ruth Lynfield","author_inst":"Minnesota Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Salina M.

Setting Level: This study utilizes data for 125 countries for contextual variables from 1st January 2020 until the 15th June 2020. Participants: This study considers deaths from covid-19. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The contextual variables considered in this study are stringency index, stringency variability, lockdown date, population density, level of airline passengers and country health security index. Results: It is shown there is a very strong association between the level of airline passengers and covid-19 deaths. The results from regression analysis conducted in this study show significant positive relationships at the 5% level of statistical significance between Deaths from covid-19 and airline passenger levels and stringency variability; significant negative relationships are revealed for stringency index and lockdown date supporting the notion that lock down and social distancing measures mattered and were effective. The Global health security index and population density did not significantly affect deaths. Conclusion: This study highlights the strong link between a country's airline passengers and covid-19 deaths and found that the lockdown date and stringency measures had a significant effect upon deaths. The implications of the research is that lockdown and stringency measures implemented by governments around the world worked and mattered. Further, the fact that global health security did not affect deaths may indicate better preparedness required to confront future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"VINCENT J.

The emerging infections that lead to substantive epidemics or pandemics are typically zoonoses that cross species boundaries at vulnerable points of animal-human interface. The sharing of space between wildlife and humans, and their domesticated animals, has dramatically increased in recent decades and is a key driver of pathogen spillover. Increasing animal-human interface has also occurred in concert with both increasing globalisation and failing health systems, resulting in a trifecta with dire implications for human and animal health. Nevertheless, to date we lack a geographical description of this trifecta that can be applied strategically to pandemic prevention. This investigation provides the first geographical quantification of the intersection of animal-human interfaces, poor human health system performance and global connectivity via the network of air travel. In so doing, this work provides a systematic, data-driven approach to classifying spillover hazard based on the distribution of animal-human interfaces while simultaneously identifying globally connected cities that are adjacent to these interfaces and which may facilitate global pathogen dissemination. We present this geography of high-impact spillover as a tool for developing targeted surveillance systems and improved health infrastructure in vulnerable areas that may present conduits for future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael G Walsh","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Shailendra Sawleshwarkar","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Shah Hossain","author_inst":"Manipal Academy of Higher Education"},{"author_name":"Siobhan Mor","author_inst":"Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Anna Pospisilova","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anna Polcrova","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jose R Medina Inojosa","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Francisco Lopez-Jimenez","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yonas E Geda","author_inst":"Barrow Neurological Institute"},{"author_name":"Gorazd B Stokin","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sue Kim","author_inst":"Michigan Department of Health and Human Services"},{"author_name":"Ruth Lynfield","author_inst":"Minnesota Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Salina M.
