We present a tool focusing on structure-based discovery and display of these groups. Since prediction of buried group pKas is computationally intensive, solvent accessibility of ionisable groups is displayed, from which the user can iteratively select pKa calculation centers. Results are color-coded, with emphasis on buried groups. Utility is demonstrated with coronaviruses, which exhibit variable dependence on the acidic pH of the endocytotic pathway. After benchmarking with variants of murine hepatitis virus, a pair of conserved histidine residues are identified that are predicted to be electrostatically frustrated at acidic pH in a common structural core of pre- and post-fusion coronavirus spike proteins. We suggest that an intermediate expanded conformation at endosomal pH could relax the frustration, allowing histidine protonation, and facilitating conformational conversion.

The study is based on mathematical model which is a modified susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. The model takes death and recovery into consideration which in convenience is called the susceptible-infected-recovered-death (SIRD) model. The criterion for the recovered patients is assumed by COVID-19 nucleic acid testing negative. The mathematical model is constructed by retrospective study. Determination of the parameters in the model is based on the epidemic bulletin supplied by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC) from Jan 16 2020 to Mar 5 2020. The data cover the date when the epidemic situation is reported and the data showed that the epidemic situation is almost under control in China. The mathematical model mainly simulates the active cases and the deaths during the outbreak of COVID-19. Then apply the mathematical model to simulate the epidemic situations in Italy and Spain, which are suffering the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. The determination of the parameters for the 2 European countries is based on the data supplied by Worldometers. By comparing the difference of the parameters based on the same mathematical model, it is possible to evaluate the different policies in different countries. It turns out that the relatively easing control policies might lead to rapid spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Institute of Blood Transfusion Chinese Academy of Medical science and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yi Huang","author_inst":"Institute of blood transfusion Chinese academy of medical science and Peking union medical college"},{"author_name":"Huifang Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of blood transfusion Chinese academy of medical science and Peking union medical college"},{"author_name":"Xu He","author_inst":"Institute of blood transfusion Chinese academy of medical science and Peking union medical college"},{"author_name":"Yonghua Yin","author_inst":"Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jiaxin Liu","author_inst":"Institute of blood transfusion Chinese academy of medical science and Peking union medical college"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.21.042911","rel_title":"Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded Specimens","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.042911","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

We identified a suitable rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Next, we established RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Furthermore, we established a multiplex fluorescence ISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication). Finally, we developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in the same FFPE section.

Available data suggest that COVID-19 case fatality rate varies temporally (as the epidemic progresses) and spatially (among countries). Here, we attempted to identify key factors possibly explaining the variability in case fatality rate across countries. Methods We used data on the temporal trajectory of case fatality rate provided by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and country-specific data on different metrics describing the incidence of known comorbidity factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation). We also compiled data on demography, economy and political regimes for each country. Findings We first showed that temporal trajectories of case fatality rate greatly vary among countries. We found no evidence for association between comorbidities and case fatality rate at the country level. Case fatality rate was negatively associated with number of hospital beds x1,000 inhabitants. We also report evidence suggesting an association between case fatality rate and the political regime, with democracies suffering from the highest mortality burden, compared to autocratic regimes. However, most of the among-country variance in case fatality rate remained unexplained. Interpretation Overall, these results emphasize the role of socio-economic and political factors as possible drivers of COVID-19 case fatality rate at the country level.

Clinical practice has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific antibodies and viral antigens can be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID-19. However, the popular point-of-care biomarker detection technologies, such as the lateral-flow test strips, provide only yes\/no information and have very limited sensitivities. Thus, it has a high false negative rate and cannot be used for the quantitative evaluation of patients immune response. Conventional ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), on the other hand, can provide quantitative, accurate, and sensitive results, but it involves complicated and expensive instruments and long assay time. In addition, samples need to be sent to centralized labs, which significantly increases the turn-around time. Here, we present a microfluidic ELISA technology for rapid (15-20 minutes), quantitative, sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers using SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and viral antigen - S protein in serum. We also characterized various humanized monoclonal IgG, and identified a candidate with a high binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein that can serve as the calibration standard of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG in serological analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our microfluidic ELISA platform can be used for rapid affinity evaluation of monoclonal anti-S1 antibodies. The microfluidic ELISA device is highly portable and requires less than 10 L of samples for each channel. Therefore, our technology will greatly facilitate rapid and quantitative analysis of COVID-19 patients and vaccine recipients at point-of-care.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaotian Tan","author_inst":"University of Michigan-Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Cory Lin","author_inst":"Sino Biological Inc"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhang","author_inst":"Sino Biological Inc"},{"author_name":"Maung Kyaw Khaing Oo","author_inst":"Optofluidic Bioassay, LLC"},{"author_name":"Xudong Fan","author_inst":"University of Michigan-Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Spencer Fox","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Lauren Ancel Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"James G Scott","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jing Gong","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Huan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaopan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Huilong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Yufei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Third Medical Centre, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, P.R.

One of the most effective strategies in reducing the severity of the pandemic is social distancing, where members of the population systematically reduce their interactions with others to limit the transmission rate of the virus. However, the implementation of social distancing can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand the potential benefits if done correctly and the risks if not. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the effects of social distancing on the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Canada. The model is based upon a standard epidemiological SEIRD model that has been stratified to directly incorporate the proportion of individuals who are following social distancing protocols. The model parameters characterizing the disease are estimated from current epidemiological data on COVID-19 using machine learning techniques. The results of the model show that social distancing policies in Canada have already saved thousands of lives and that the prolonged adherence to social distancing guidelines could save thousands more. Importantly, our model indicates that social distancing can significantly delay the onset of infection peaks, allowing more time for the production of a vaccine or additional medical resources. Furthermore, our results stress the importance of easing social distancing restrictions gradually, rather than all at once, in order to prevent a second wave of infections. Model results are compared to the current capacity of the Canadian healthcare system by examining the current and future number of ventilators available for use, emphasizing the need for the increased production of additional medical resources.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brydon Eastman","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Cameron Meaney","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Michelle Przedborski","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Kohandel","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Xudong Fan","author_inst":"University of Michigan-Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Spencer Fox","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Lauren Ancel Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"James G Scott","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jing Gong","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Huan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaopan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Huilong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Yufei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Third Medical Centre, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, P.R.

Although complex between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 has been structurally resolved, the molecular details of the SARS-CoV-2 and TMPRSS2 complex are still elusive. TMPRSS2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites, Arg685\/Ser686 and Arg815\/Ser816. The present study aims to investigate the conformational details of complex between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike and to point candidate drug targets. Briefly, full length structural model of TMPRSS2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites. The docking simulations showed that TMPRSS2 interacts with the two different loops of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, each containing different cleavage sites. Key functional residues of TMPRSS2 (His296, Ser441 and Ser460) were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared to the N-terminal cleavage site (Arg685\/Ser686), TMPRSS2 region that interact with C-terminal cleavage site (Arg815\/Ser816) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable. In summary, the present study provide structural characteristics of molecular complex between human TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and points to the candidate drug targets that could further be exploited to direct structure base drug designing.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mushtaq Hussain","author_inst":"Dow College of Biotechnology, Dow University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nusrat Jabeen","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Karachi"},{"author_name":"Anusha Amanullah","author_inst":"Dow College of Biotechnology, Dow University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Ashraf Baig","author_inst":"Dow College of Biotechnology, Dow University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Basma Aziz","author_inst":"Dow College of Biotechnology, Dow University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sanya Shabbir","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Karachi, Dow Research Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedical Sciences, Dow College of Biotechnology, Dow University"},{"author_name":"Fozia Raza","author_inst":"Dow College of Biotechnology, Dow University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"James G Scott","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jing Gong","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Huan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaopan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Huilong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Yufei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Third Medical Centre, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, P.R.

A heuristic global Gaussian-function-based algorithm for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic trend is proposed for estimating how the temporal evolution of the pandemic develops by predicting daily COVID-19 deaths, for up to 10 days, starting with the day the prediction is made. The validity of the proposed heuristic global algorithm was tested in the case of China (at different temporal stages of the pandemic). The algorithm was used to obtain predictions in six different locations: California, New York, Iran, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the entire United States, and in all cases the prediction was confirmed. Our findings show that this algorithm offers a robust and reliable method for revealing the temporal dynamics and disease trends of SARS-CoV-2, and could be a useful tool for the relevant authorities in settings worldwide.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Panagiotis G.

The large number of patients requiring intensive care threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems globally. Likewise, there is a compelling need for a COVID-19 disease severity test to prioritize care and resources for patients at elevated risk of mortality. Here, an integrated point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score and clinical decision support system is presented using biomarker measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminus pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), myoglobin (MYO), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The COVID-19 Severity Score combines multiplex biomarker measurements and risk factors in a statistical learning algorithm to predict mortality. The COVID-19 Severity Score was trained and evaluated using data from 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China. Our analysis finds that COVID-19 Severity Scores were significantly higher for the group that died versus the group that was discharged with median (interquartile range) scores of 59 (40-83) and 9 (6-17), respectively, and area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.99). These promising initial models pave the way for a point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score system to impact patient care after further validation with externally collected clinical data. Clinical decision support tools for COVID-19 have strong potential to empower healthcare providers to save lives by prioritizing critical care in patients at high risk for adverse outcomes.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael P McRae","author_inst":"New York University College of Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Glennon W Simmons","author_inst":"New York University College of Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Nicolaos J Christodoulides","author_inst":"New York University College of Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Zhibing Lu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Department of Cardiology"},{"author_name":"Stella K Kang","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine, Departments of Radiology, Population Health"},{"author_name":"David Fenyo","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology"},{"author_name":"Timothy Alcorn","author_inst":"Latham BioPharm Group"},{"author_name":"Isaac P Dapkins","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine, Departments of Population Health, Internal Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Sharif","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine, Departments of Pediatrics and Population Health"},{"author_name":"Deniz Vurmaz","author_inst":"NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering"},{"author_name":"Sayli S Modak","author_inst":"New York University College of Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Kritika Srinivasan","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Shruti Warhadpande","author_inst":"New York University College of Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Ravi Shrivastav","author_inst":"New York University College of Dentistry"},{"author_name":"John T McDevitt","author_inst":"New York University College of Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Yang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Third Medical Centre, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 100850, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhong","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yuan Cao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, the 960th Hospital of PLA, Jinan, 250031, China"},{"author_name":"Congwen Wei","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.048751","rel_title":"REVEALING COVID-19 TRANSMISSION BY SARS-CoV-2 GENOME SEQUENCING AND AGENT BASED MODELLING","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.048751","rel_abs":"Community transmission of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major public health concern that remains difficult to assess.

SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced from 209 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between January and March 2020. Only a quarter of cases appeared to be locally acquired and genomic-based estimates of local transmission rates were concordant with predictions from a computational agent-based model.

The current gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is real-time RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Low sensitivity, exposure risks to healthcare workers, and global shortages of swabs and personal protective equipment, however, necessitate the validation of new diagnostic approaches. Saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because (1) collection is minimally invasive and can reliably be self-administered and (2) saliva has exhibited comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs in detection of other respiratory pathogens, including endemic human coronaviruses, in previous studies. To validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we tested nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients and self-collected samples from healthcare workers on COVID-19 wards. When we compared SARS-CoV-2 detection from patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples, we found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection. Furthermore, we report less variability in self-sample collection of saliva. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that saliva is a viable and more sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and could enable at-home self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.","rel_num_authors":50,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"John Fournier","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Melissa Campbell","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Tokuyama","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pavithra Vijayakumar","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bertie Geng","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"M.

The study has thus far included 10 cycles of respirator decontamination, with periodic qualitative and quantitative fit testing to verify ongoing respirator integrity through the decontamination process, and support a statistical evaluation of successful respirator fit. In addition, we have conducted virologic testing of respirator surfaces and materials to demonstrate a rigorous verification of decontamination. Given that the current pandemic entails a respiratory viral pathogen, it is critical to address these aspects of respirator safety for reuse. These measures are intended to provide a foundation for a suitable decontamination process, which maintains N95 function, and supports safe respirator reuse by healthcare providers. Current results from both respirator fit testing and virologic testing indicate that the process is effective on the basis of zero failure rate on fit-testing of selected respirators, and on complete decontamination of multiple virus species by aHP treatment, comparable to that observed with commercial spore-based biological indicators of sterilization.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"T.

In April 2020 five databases were searched for relevant literature and main findings were extracted. Thirteen papers were included in the review. The following themes were identified: negative emotional states; living with uncertainty; concerns about infection; concerns about and uptake of prophylaxis or treatment; disrupted routines; non-pharmaceutical protective behaviours; social support; demands from others; financial and occupational concerns; disrupted expectations of birth, prenatal care and postnatal care, and; sources of information. Results showed that pregnant women have unique needs during infectious disease outbreaks and could benefit from: up-to-date, consistent information and guidance; appropriate support and advice from healthcare professionals, particularly with regards to the risks and benefits of prophylaxis and treatment; virtual support groups, and; designating locations or staff specifically for pregnant women.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha K Brooks","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Dale Weston","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Neil Greenberg","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Prem P.

In the absence of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines, well-targeted social distancing measures are essential for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing strain on local health systems, and preventing mortality. Here, we provide a quantitative assessment of the efficacy of social distancing to slow COVID-19 transmission and reduce hospital surge, depending on the timing and extent of the measures imposed for a metropolitan region and its health care systems. We built a granular mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission that incorporated age-specific and risk-stratified heterogeneity, estimates for the transmission, and severity of COVID-19 using current best evidence. We performed thousands of stochastic simulations of COVID-19 transmission in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Area to project the impact of school closures coupled with social distancing measures that were estimated to reduce non-household contacts by 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 90%. We compare early versus late implementation and estimate the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU patients, ventilator needs and deaths through mid-August, 2020. We queried local emergency services and hospital systems to estimate total hospital bed, ICU, and ventilator capacity for the region. We expected COVID-19 hospital beds and ICU requirements would surpass local capacity by mid-May if no intervention was taken. Assuming a four-day epidemic doubling time, school closures alone would be expected to reduce peak hospitalizations by only 18% and cumulative deaths by less than 3%. Immediate social distancing measures that reduced non-household contacts by over 75%, such as stay-at-home orders and closing of non-essential businesses, would be required to ensure that COVID-19 cases do not overwhelm local hospital surge capacity. Peak ICU bed demand prior to mid August 2020 would be expected to be reduced from 2,121 (95% CI: 2,018-2,208) with no intervention to 698 (95% CI: 204-1,100) with 75% social distancing and 136 (95% CI: 38-308) with 90% social distancing; current ICU bed capacity was estimated at 680. A two-week delay in implementation of such measures is projected to accelerate a local ICU bed shortage by four weeks. School closures alone hardly impact the epidemic curve. Immediate social distancing measures that reduce non-household contacts by over 75% were required to ensure that COVID-19 cases do not overwhelm local hospital surge capacity. These findings helped inform the Stay Home-Work Safe order enacted by the city of Austin, Texas on March 24, 2020 as a means of mitigating the emerging COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xutong Wang","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Remy F Pasco","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Du","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Michaela Petty","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Spencer J Fox","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Alison P Galvani","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Michael Pignone","author_inst":"Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"S.

It affects every country without considering country's race, nationality and economic status. This paper aims at analysing primarily the current situations of Bangladesh and predicting infections and deaths for moderated term intervals by a proposed projection technique called Infection Trajectory-Pathway Strategy (ITPS) and for short term intervals prediction for total infections, deaths along with total number of severe patients and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients by polynomial regression modeling approach. Since April 7, Bangladesh has started to face critical situations as the number of infections has accelerated very fast in the following days. However, the fatality rate decreases considerably from 15.7 on April 1 to 4.9 on April 14, which is still high among the south asian countries. Of the 1012 cases reported on April 14, almost 70\\% are the male, 42\\% are from the capital Dhaka. We have found that the potential pathway of infections for Bangldesh would be the similar pathways that are experienced by Austria, Netherlands, Israel, France and United Kingdom. These countries are ahead a number of weeks and days in terms of infection cases since their 100-th confirmed cases. Our proposed projection method ITPS suggests that by May 10, Bangladesh will cross 12000 incidences and 720 deaths which, by May 16 will be 27000 and 1644 respectively. On the other hand, the regression model suggests that by the end of April, total number of infections, deaths, severe patients and ICU patients will be 5780, 347, 775, and 694 respectively. This study will be favorable for the administrative units of Bangladesh to plan for the next few weeks and to consider various aspects related to the control of COVID-19 outspread in Bangladesh","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Hasinur Rahaman Khan","author_inst":"University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Hossain","author_inst":"North South University, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Du","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Michaela Petty","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Spencer J Fox","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Alison P Galvani","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Michael Pignone","author_inst":"Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"S.

We aimed to collate and summarize all published systematic reviews on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods: Nine databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Sciences, PDQ-Evidence, WHO's Global Research, LILACS and Epistemonikos) were searched from December 1, 2019 to March 24, 2020. Systematic reviews analyzing primary studies of COVID-19 were included. Two authors independently undertook screening, selection, extraction (data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, diagnostic test assessment, laboratory and radiological findings) and quality assessment (AMSTAR 2). Meta-analysis on prevalence of clinical outcomes was performed. Results: Eighteen systematic reviews were included; one was empty. Using AMSTAR 2, confidence in the results of 13 reviews was rated as \"critically low\", one as \"low\", one as \"moderate\" and two as \"high\". Symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of point estimates): fever (82-95%), cough with or without sputum (58-72%), dyspnea (26-59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29-51%), sore throat (10-13%), headache (8-12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5-9%). Severe symptoms were more common in men. Elevated C-reactive protein (associated with lymphocytopenia) and lactate dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. Chest imaging described a frequent pattern of uni- or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. Only one review investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3% to 14%. Conclusions: Confidence in the results of most reviews was \"critically low\". Future studies and systematic reviews should adhere to established methodologies. The majority of included systematic reviews were hampered by imprecise search strategy and no previous protocol submission.

By February 4, 2020, the government of Singapore restricted the mobility of the vulnerable age-groups. In the current study, we study the influence of the age-based vulnerability of the population with respect to COVID-19 conditions on the recovery of COVID-19 patients. We study 245 patients in Singapore recovered and discharged during January 23--April 01. We first study the descriptive statistics of the length of in-hospital stay (LOS) of the COVID-19 patients based on demographic variables, namely age, and gender. Then, we determine the distribution of LOS, using local and generalized linear regression models. We take the approach of periodization based on critical changes in the disease transmission model. Even though the overall recovery rate has reduced drastically after a sudden spike in daily confirmations, our analysis shows that there is a considerable shift in the COVID-19 confirmations to the population in the non-vulnerable age-groups. We show that the LOS of the non-vulnerable age group is considerably lower at 9 days, as opposed to 15 or 20 days in the existing literature.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaya Sreevalsan-Nair","author_inst":"International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, Karnataka, India"},{"author_name":"Reddy Rani Vangimalla","author_inst":"International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, Karnataka, India"},{"author_name":"Pritesh Rajesh Ghogale","author_inst":"International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, Karnataka, India"},{"author_name":"Hebatullah Mohamed Abdulazeem","author_inst":"Department of Sport and Health Science, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ishanka Weerasekara","author_inst":"School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medicine, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, Australia and Department of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Allied "},{"author_name":"Ana Marusic","author_inst":"Cochrane Croatia, University of Split, School of Medicine, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Livia Puljak","author_inst":"Center for Evidence-Based Medicine and Health Care, Catholic University of Croatia, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Vinicius Tassoni Civile","author_inst":"Cochrane Brazil; Evidence-Based Health Program, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Irena Zakarija-Grkovic","author_inst":"Cochrane Croatia, University of Split, School of Medicine, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Tina Poklepovic Pericic","author_inst":"Cochrane Croatia, University of Split, School of Medicine, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Cochrane Brazil; Evidence-Based Health Program, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Santino Filoso","author_inst":"Yorkville University, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nicola Luigi Bragazzi","author_inst":"Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (LIAM), Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Milena Soriano Marcolino","author_inst":"University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Klein","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Earnest","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Simonov","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan Handoko","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nida Naushad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo R.

The aim of our study was to use the official data and predict the possible outcomes of the COVID 19 pandemic using artificial intelligence (AI) based RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), then compare and validate the predicted and observed data. Materials and Methods: We used the publicly available datasets of World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University to create the training dataset, then have used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with gated recurring units (Long Short Term Memory: LSTM units) to create 2 Prediction Models. Information collected in the first t time steps were aggregated with a fully connected (dense) neural network layer and a consequent regression output layer to determine the next predicted value. We used root mean squared logarithmic errors (RMSLE) to compare the predicted and observed data, then recalculated the predictions again. Results: The result of our study underscores that the COVID19 pandemic is probably a propagated source epidemic, therefore repeated peaks on the epidemic curve (rise of the daily number of the newly diagnosed infections) are to be anticipated. The errors between the predicted and validated data and trends seems to be low. Conclusions: The influence of this pandemic is great worldwide, impact our everyday lifes. Especially decision makers must be aware, that even if strict public health measures are executed and sustained, future peaks of infections are possible. The AI based predictions might be useful tools for predictions and the models can be recalculated according to the new observed data, to get more precise forecast of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laszlo Robert Kolozsvari","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Tamas Berczes","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Andras Hajdu","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Rudolf Gesztelyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Attila TIba","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Imre Varga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Cochrane Brazil; Evidence-Based Health Program, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Santino Filoso","author_inst":"Yorkville University, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nicola Luigi Bragazzi","author_inst":"Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (LIAM), Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Milena Soriano Marcolino","author_inst":"University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Klein","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Earnest","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Simonov","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan Handoko","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nida Naushad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo R.

In order to tackle the crisis effectively we need to know the trajectories of number of the people infected (i.e. confirmed cases). Such information is crucial to government agencies for developing effective preparedness plans and strategies. We used a statistical modeling approach (extreme value distributions, EVDs) for projecting the future confirmed cases on a global scale. Using the 69 days data (from January 22, 2020 to March 30, 2020), the EVDs model predicted the number of confirmed cases from March 31, 2020 to April 9, 2020 (validation period) with an absolute percentage error < 15 % and then projected the number of confirmed cases until the end of June 2020. Also, we have quantified the uncertainty in the future projections due to the delay in reporting of the confirmed cases on a global scale. Based on the projections, we found that total confirmed cases would reach around 11.4 million globally by the end of June 2020.The USA may have 2.9 million number of confirmed cases followed by Spain(1.52 million) and Italy (1.28 million).","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M Aadhityaa","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"},{"author_name":"KS Kasiviswanathan","author_inst":"Department of Water Resources Development and Management, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"},{"author_name":"Idhayachandhiran Ilampooranan","author_inst":"Department of Water Resources Development and Management, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"},{"author_name":"B Soundharajan","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"},{"author_name":"M Balamurugan","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jianxun He","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Cochrane Brazil; Evidence-Based Health Program, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Santino Filoso","author_inst":"Yorkville University, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nicola Luigi Bragazzi","author_inst":"Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (LIAM), Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Milena Soriano Marcolino","author_inst":"University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Klein","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Earnest","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Simonov","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan Handoko","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nida Naushad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo R.

Countries presently apply different strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Differences in population structures, decision making, health systems and numerous other factors result in various trajectories in terms of mortality at country scale. Our objective in this manuscript is to disentangle the future of second-line European countries (i.e. countries that present, today, a moderate death rate) with respect to the current COVID-19 wave. Method. We propose a data-driven approach, grounded on a mixture model, to forecast the dynamics of the number of deaths from COVID-19 in a given focal country using data from countries that are ahead in time in terms of COVID-19-induced mortality. In this approach, the mortality curves of ahead-in-time countries are used to build predictors, which are then used as the components of the mixture model. This approach was applied to eight second-line European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden), using Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom as well as the Hubei province in China to build predictors. For this analysis, we used data pooled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Results. In general, the second-line European countries tend to follow relatively mild mortality curves (typically, those of Switzerland and Hubei) rather than fast and severe ones (typically, those of Spain, Italy, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom). From a methodological viewpoint, the performance of our forecasting approach is about 80% up to 8 days in the future, as soon as the focal country has accumulated at least two hundreds of deaths. Discussion. Our results suggest that the continuation of the current COVID-19 wave across Europe will likely be mitigated, and not as strong as it was in most of the front-line countries first impacted by the wave.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Soubeyrand","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Melina Ribaud","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Virgile Baudrot","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denis Allard","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Cochrane Brazil; Evidence-Based Health Program, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Santino Filoso","author_inst":"Yorkville University, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nicola Luigi Bragazzi","author_inst":"Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (LIAM), Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Milena Soriano Marcolino","author_inst":"University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Klein","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Earnest","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Simonov","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan Handoko","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nida Naushad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo R.

We call this route self-burnout. We consider a region with (a) no influx of corona cases from the outside, (b) extensive social distancing, though not necessarily a full lockdown, and (c) high testing capacity relative to the actual number of new cases per day. These conditions can make it possible for the region to initiate the endgame phase of epidemic management, wherein the disease is slowly made to burn itself out through a combination of social distancing, sanitization, contact tracing and preventive testing. The dynamics of the case trajectories in this regime are governed by a single-variable first order linear delay differential equation, whose stability criterion can be obtained analytically. Basis this criterion, we conclude that the social mobility restrictions should be such as to ensure that on the average, one person interacts closely (from the transmission viewpoint) with at most one other person over a 4-5 day period. If the endgame can be played out for a long enough time, we claim that the Coronavirus can eventually get completely contained without affecting a significant fraction of the region's population. We present estimates of the duration for which the epidemic is expected to last, finding an interval of approximately 5-15 weeks after the self-burnout phase is initiated. South Korea, Austria, Australia, New Zealand and the states of Goa, Kerala and Odisha in India appear to be well on the way towards containing COVID by this method.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B Shayak","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Richard H Rand","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Virgile Baudrot","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denis Allard","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Cochrane Brazil; Evidence-Based Health Program, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Santino Filoso","author_inst":"Yorkville University, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nicola Luigi Bragazzi","author_inst":"Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (LIAM), Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Milena Soriano Marcolino","author_inst":"University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Klein","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Earnest","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Simonov","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan Handoko","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nida Naushad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo R.

Covid-19 infection has major international health and economic impacts and risk factors for infection are not completely understood. Cannabis smoking is linked with poor respiratory health, immunosuppression and multiple contaminants. Potential synergism between the two epidemics would represent a major public health convergence. Cigarettes were implicated with disease severity in Wuhan, China. Objective. Is cannabis use epidemiologically associated with coronavirus incidence rate (CVIR)? Design. Cross-sectional state-based multivariable study. Setting. USA. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures. CVIR. Multivariable-adjusted geospatially-weighted regression models. As the American cannabis epidemic is characterized by a recent doubling of daily cannabis use it was considered important to characterize the contribution of high intensity use. Results. Significant associations of daily cannabis use quintile with CVIR were identified with the highest quintile having a prevalence ratio 5.11 (95%C.I. 4.90-5.33), an attributable fraction in the exposed (AFE) 80.45% (79.61-81.25%) and an attributable fraction in the population of 77.80% (76.88-78.68%) with Chi-squared-for-trend (14,782, df=4) significant at P<10-500. Similarly when cannabis legalization was considered decriminalization was associated with an elevated CVIR prevalence ratio 4.51 (95%C.I. 4.45-4.58), AFE 77.84% (77.50-78.17%) and Chi-squared-for-trend (56,679, df=2) significant at P<10-500. Monthly and daily use were linked with CVIR in bivariate geospatial regression models (P=0.0027, P=0.0059). In multivariable additive models number of flight origins and population density were significant. In interactive geospatial models adjusted for international travel, ethnicity, income, population, population density and drug use, terms including last month cannabis were significant from P=7.3x10-15, daily cannabis use from P=7.3x10-11 and last month cannabis was independently associated (P=0.0365). Conclusions and Relevance. Data indicate CVIR demonstrates significant trends across cannabis use intensity quintiles and with relaxed cannabis legislation. Recent cannabis use is independently predictive of CVIR in bivariate and multivariable adjusted models and intensity of use is interactively significant. Cannabis thus joins tobacco as a SARS2-CoV-2 risk factor.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert S Reece","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Gary K Hulse","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Virgile Baudrot","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denis Allard","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Cochrane Brazil; Evidence-Based Health Program, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Santino Filoso","author_inst":"Yorkville University, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nicola Luigi Bragazzi","author_inst":"Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (LIAM), Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Milena Soriano Marcolino","author_inst":"University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Klein","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Earnest","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Simonov","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan Handoko","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nida Naushad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo R.

The infection shows the primary symptoms of pneumonia and has an incubation period, with the majority of people showing symptoms within 14 days. Online Social Networks are the closest simulations of real-world networks and have similar topology characteristics. This article simulates the spread and control of the nCoV-19 using the SIQR-t model to highlight the importance of self-quarantine and exercise of proper health care as a method to prevent the spread of the virus. Method The article uses the Susceptible-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered model with modification, introducing 14 different Infected states depending on the number of days the host has been carrying the infection. We simulate the spread of 2019-nCoV on human interaction similar graph taken from Online Social Network Epinions, of about 75000 nodes, similar to a small town or settlement. The infection rates depend on the sanitation and cleanliness these people exercise. Results When people practice self-quarantine and hygiene, aided by the governmental efforts of testing and quarantine, the cumulative number of affected people fall drastically. The decrease is apparent in time-based simulations of the spread received from the study. Conclusion The 2019-nCoV is a highly infectious zoonotic virus. It has spread like a pandemic, and governments across the world have launched quarantines. The results of the SIQR-t model indicate that hygiene and social-distancing can reduce its impact and sharply decrease the infection scale. Individual efforts are key to the control.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nipun aggarwal","author_inst":"Delhi Technological University"},{"author_name":"Gary K Hulse","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Virgile Baudrot","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denis Allard","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Cochrane Brazil; Evidence-Based Health Program, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Santino Filoso","author_inst":"Yorkville University, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nicola Luigi Bragazzi","author_inst":"Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (LIAM), Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Milena Soriano Marcolino","author_inst":"University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Klein","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Earnest","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Simonov","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan Handoko","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nida Naushad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo R.

Objective: Project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1, 2020, in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12, 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM) is an open, transparent, and continuously updated (www.cghr.org\/covid) statistical model that combines actual COVID-19 mortality counts with Bayesian inference to forecast COVID-19 deaths, the date of peak deaths, and the duration of excess mortality. The analyses covered a total of 700 million population above age 20 in 12 countries or regions: USA; Italy; Spain; France; UK; Iran; Belgium; a province of China (Hubei, which accounted for 90% of reported Chinese deaths); Germany; the Netherlands; Switzerland; and Canada; and six US states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, California, and Washington. Results: Forecasted deaths across the 12 current high-burden countries sum 167,000 to 593,000 (median 253,000). The trajectory of US deaths (49,000-249,000 deaths; median 86,000)- over half of which are expected in states beyond the initial six states analysed in this study- will have the greatest impact on the eventual total. Mortality ranges are 25,000-109,000 (median 46,000) in the UK; 23,000-31,000 (median 26,000) in Italy; 21,000-37,000 (median 26,000) in France and 21,000-32,000 (median 25,000) in Spain. Estimates are most precise for Hubei, China, where the epidemic curve is complete, and least precise in California, where it is ongoing. New York has the highest cumulative median mortality rate per million (1135), about 12-fold that of Germany. Mortality trajectories are notably flatter in Germany, California, and Washington State, each of which took physical distancing and testing strategies seriously. Using past country-specific mortality as a guide, GCAM predicts surge capacity needs, reaching more than twice existing capacity in a number of places., In every setting, the results might be sensitive to undercounts of COVID-19 deaths, which are already apparent. Conclusion and Relevance: Mortality from COVID-19 will be substantial across many settings, even in the best case scenario. GCAM will provide continually updated and increasingly precise estimates as the pandemic progresses.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Brown","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Prabhat Jha","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"CGHR COVID Mortality Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Denis Allard","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Cochrane Brazil; Evidence-Based Health Program, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Santino Filoso","author_inst":"Yorkville University, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nicola Luigi Bragazzi","author_inst":"Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (LIAM), Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Milena Soriano Marcolino","author_inst":"University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Klein","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Earnest","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Simonov","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan Handoko","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nida Naushad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo R.
