However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable. Furthermore, to increase the number of people that can be first released, lockdown should not be ended until the number of new daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold. We model a gradual release strategy by allowing different fractions of those in lockdown to re-enter the working non-quarantined population. Mathematical optimisation methods, combined with our adapted SEIR model, determine how to maximise those working while preventing the health service from being overwhelmed. The optimal strategy is broadly found to be to release approximately half the population two-to-four weeks from the end of an initial infection peak, then wait another three-to-four months to allow for a second peak before releasing everyone else. We also modelled an ''on-off'' strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism. The two quantities most critical in determining the optimal solution are transmission rate and the recovery rate, where the latter is defined as the fraction of infected people in any given day that then become classed as recovered. We suggest that the accurate identification of these values is of particular importance to the ongoing monitoring of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Rawson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tom Brewer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dessislava Veltcheva","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Huntingford","author_inst":"UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology"},{"author_name":"Michael B.

We investigated demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors, and compared them to risk factors for pneumonia and influenza in UK Biobank. Methods UK Biobank recruited 37-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population. The outcome of confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test) was linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes. Findings Among 428,225 participants, 340 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index (RR 1.24 per SD increase), smoking (RR 1.38), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.66) and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.40). Non-modifiable risk factors included older age (RR 1.10 per 5 years), male sex (RR 1.64), black ethnicity (RR 1.86), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.26 per SD increase in Townsend Index), longstanding illness (RR 1.38) and high cystatin C (RR 1.24 per 1 SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat; less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza. Interpretation These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.

Clear data about the pandemic's impact is lacking, namely regarding mortality. This work aims to study the impact of COVID-19 through the analysis of all-cause mortality data made available by different European countries, and to critique their mortality surveillance data. METHODS European countries that had publicly available data about the number of deaths per day\/week were selected (England and Wales, France, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal). Two different methods were selected to estimate the excess mortality due to COVID19: (DEV) deviation from the expected value from homologue periods, and (RSTS) remainder after seasonal time series decomposition. We estimate total, age- and gender-specific excess mortality. Furthermore, we compare different policy responses to COVID-19. RESULTS Excess mortality was found in all 5 countries, ranging from 10.6% in Portugal (DEV) to 98.5% in Italy (DEV). Furthermore, excess mortality is higher than COVID-attributed deaths in all 5 countries. DISCUSSION The impact of COVID-19 on mortality appears to be larger than officially attributed deaths, in varying degrees in different countries. Comparisons between countries would be useful, but large disparities in mortality surveillance data could not be overcome. Unreliable data, and even a lack of cause-specific mortality data undermine the understanding of the impact of policy choices on both direct and indirect deaths during COVID-19. European countries should invest more on mortality surveillance systems to improve the publicly available data.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Felix-Cardoso","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Henrique Vasconcelos","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Pedro Rodrigues","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Cruz-Correia","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Claire L Niedzwiedz","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Donald M.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+\/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+\/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+\/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+\/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled. Worldwide preparedness and vulnerability against COVID-19 should be regarded with more care.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lingling Zheng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kang Qin","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shuai Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dong Liu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Weiyao Liao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Huimin Xia","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jinling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Huiying Liang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daniel F.

Knowledge of coronavirus-related risk factors can help countries build more systematic and successful responses to COVID-19 disease outbreak. Here we used Supervised Machine Learning and Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) techniques to reveal correlates and patterns of COVID-19 Disease outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods: We analyzed time series aggregate data compiled by Johns Hopkins University on the outbreak of COVID-19 disease across SSA. COVID-19 data was merged with additional data on socio-demographic and health indicator survey data for 39 of SSA 48 countries that reported confirmed cases and deaths from coronavirus between February 28, 2020 through March 26, 2020. We used supervised machine learning algorithm, Lasso for variable selection and statistical inference. EBK was used to also create a raster estimating the spatial distribution of COVID-19 disease outbreak. Results: The lasso Cross-fit partialing out predictive model ascertained seven variables significantly associated with the risk of coronavirus infection (i.e. new HIV infections among pediatric, adolescent, and middle-aged adult PLHIV, time (days), pneumococcal conjugate-based vaccine, incidence of malaria and diarrhea treatment). Our study indicates, the doubling time in new coronavirus cases was 3 days. The steady three-day decrease in coronavirus outbreak rate of change (ROC) from 37% on March 23, 2020 to 23% on March 26, 2020 indicates the positive impact of countries' steps to stymie the outbreak. The interpolated maps show that coronavirus is rising every day and appears to be severely confined in South Africa. In the West African region (i.e. Burkina Faso, Ghana, Senegal, CotedIviore, Cameroon, and Nigeria), we predict that new cases and deaths from the virus are most likely to increase. Interpretation: Integrated and efficiently delivered interventions to reduce HIV, pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea, are essential to accelerating global health efforts. Scaling up screening and increasing COVID-19 testing capacity across SSA countries can help provide better understanding on how the pandemic is progressing and possibly ensure a sustained decline in the ROC of coronavirus outbreak.

We investigate the racial and socioeconomic associations of COVID-19 hospitalization among 418,794 participants of the UK Biobank, of whom 549 (0.13%) had been hospitalized. Both black participants (odds ratio 3.4; 95%CI 2.4-4.9) and Asian participants (odds ratio 2.1; 95%CI 1.5-3.2) were at substantially increased risk as compared to white participants. We further observed a striking gradient in COVID-19 hospitalization rates according to the Townsend Deprivation Index - a composite measure of socioeconomic deprivation - and household income. Adjusting for such factors led to only modest attenuation of the increased risk in black participants, adjusted odds ratio 3.1 (95%CI 2.0-4.8). These observations confirm and extend earlier preliminary and lay press reports of higher morbidity in non-white individuals in the context of a large population of participants in a national biobank.

At the same time, they can be contagious to highly vulnerable individuals seeking health care. This study aims at estimating the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and associated factors in HCW from a large referral hospital in Barcelona, Spain, one of the countries hardest hit by COVID-19 in the world. Methods: From 28 March to 9 April 2020, we recruited a random sample of 578 HCW from the human resources database of Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. We collected a nasopharyngeal swab for direct SARS-CoV-2 detection through real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), as well as blood for plasma antibody quantification. IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were measured by Luminex. The cumulative prevalence of infection (past or current) was defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and\/or antibody seropositivity. Results: Of the 578 total participants, 39 (6.7%, 95% CI: 4.8-9.1) had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 by rRT-PCR, 14 (2.4%, 95% CI: 1.4-4.3) had a positive rRT-PCR at recruitment, and 54 (9.3%, 95% CI: 7.2-12.0) were seropositive for IgM and\/or IgG and\/or IgA against SARS-CoV-2. Of the 54 seropositive HCW, 21 (38.9%) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, although 10 of them (47.6%) reported past COVID-19-compatible symptoms. The cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.2% (65\/578, 95% CI: 8.9-14.1). Among those with evidence of past or current infection, 40.0% (26\/65) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, of which 46.2% (12\/26) had history of COVID-19-compatible symptoms. The odds of being seropositive was higher in participants who reported any COVID-19 symptom (OR: 8.84, 95% CI: 4.41-17.73). IgM levels positively correlated with age (rho=0.36, p-value=0.031) and were higher in participants with more than 10 days since onset of symptoms (p-value=0.022), and IgA levels were higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic subjects (p-value=0.041). Conclusions: The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among HCW was lower than expected. Thus, being a high-risk population, we anticipate these estimates to be an upper limit to the seroprevalence of the general population. Forty per cent of those with past or present infection had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, which calls for active periodic rRT-PCR testing among all HCW to minimize potential risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto L Garcia-Basteiro","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Gemma Moncunill","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Marta Tortajada","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Marta Vidal","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Caterina Guinovart","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Alfons Jimenez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Rebeca Santano","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sergi Sanz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Susana Mendez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Anna Llupia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rugh Aguilar","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Selena Alonso","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Diana Barrios","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlo Carolis","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Pau Cistero","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Choliz","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Angeline Cruz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Silvia Fochs","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Chenjerai Jairoce","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Jochen Hecht","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Regulation"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Lamoglia","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Mikel J Martinez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Mitchell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ortega","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Nuria Pey","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Puyol","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Marta Ribes","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Neus Rosell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Patricia Sotomayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Torres","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Williams","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sonia Barroso","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Anna Vilella","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Munoz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Pilar Varela","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlota Dobano","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20082206","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 receptor mutation in Egyptian population","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20082206","rel_abs":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We then tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus on the West Coast. We expect the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Bryan","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Gregory Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark H.

We received a request from National Health Systems Resource Centre, a public agency in India, for a Rapid Evidence Synthesis (RES) on community health workers (CHWs) for COVID-19 prevention and control. Methods: We searched PubMed, websites of ministries, public agencies, multilateral institutions, COVID-19 resource aggregators and pre-prints (without language restrictions) for articles on the role, challenges and enablers for CHWs in pandemics. Two reviewers screened the records independently with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. One reviewer extracted data in a consensus data extraction form with another reviewer cross-checking it. A framework on CHW performance in primary healthcare not specific to pandemic was used to guide data extraction and narrative analysis. Results: We retrieved 211 records and finally included 36 articles on the role, challenges and enablers for CHWs in pandemics. We found that CHWs play an important role in building awareness, countering stigma and maintaining essential primary healthcare service delivery. It is essential that CHWs are provided adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and appropriately trained in its usage in the early stages of the pandemic. Wide range of policies and guidance is required to ensure health systems functioning. A clear guidance for prioritizing essential activities, postponing non-essential ones and additional pandemic related activities is crucial. CHWs experience stigmatization, isolation and social exclusion. Psychosocial support, non-performance-based incentives, additional transport allowance, accommodation, child-support, awards and recognition programs have been used in previous pandemics. We also created inventories of resources with guiding notes for quick utility by decision makers on guidelines for health workers (n=24), self-isolation in the community (n=10) and information, education and counselling materials on COVID-19 (n=16). Conclusions: CHWs play a critical role in pandemics like COVID-19. It is important to ensure role clarity, training, supportive supervision, as well as their work satisfaction, health and well-being. There is a need for more implementation research on CHWs in pandemics like COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soumyadeep Bhaumik","author_inst":"The George Institute for Global Health, India"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Moola","author_inst":"The George Institute for Global Health, India"},{"author_name":"Jyoti Tyagi","author_inst":"The George Institute for Global Health, India"},{"author_name":"Devaki Nambiar","author_inst":"The George Institute for Global Health, India"},{"author_name":"Misimi Kakoti","author_inst":"The George Institute for Global Health, India"},{"author_name":"Hadiseh Alimoradi","author_inst":"Kerman University of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Keith Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Anna Llupia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rugh Aguilar","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Selena Alonso","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Diana Barrios","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlo Carolis","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Pau Cistero","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Choliz","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Angeline Cruz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Silvia Fochs","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Chenjerai Jairoce","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Jochen Hecht","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Regulation"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Lamoglia","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Mikel J Martinez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Mitchell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ortega","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Nuria Pey","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Puyol","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Marta Ribes","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Neus Rosell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Patricia Sotomayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Torres","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Williams","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sonia Barroso","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Anna Vilella","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Munoz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Pilar Varela","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlota Dobano","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20082370","rel_title":"Ecologic correlation between underlying population level morbidities and COVID-19 case fatality rate among countries infected with SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20082370","rel_abs":"Background: The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unprecedented in scope. High income countries (HIC) seemingly account for the majority of the mortalities considering that these countries have screened more persons. Low middle income countries (LMIC) countries may experience far worse mortalities considering the existence of a weaker health care system and the several underlying population level morbidities. As a result, it becomes imperative to understand the ecological correlation between critical underlying population level morbidities and COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR). Method: This is an ecological study using data on COVID-19 cases, prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, adult HIV prevalence, quality of air and life expectancy. We plotted a histogram, performed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and used spearman correlation to assess the degree of correlation between COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) and other covariates mentioned above. Result: As at the 31st of March 2020, there were a total of 846,281 cases of COVID-19 from 204 countries and a global case fatality rate of 5% (range 0% to 29%). Angola and Sudan both had the highest CFR of 29%, while Italy had the highest number of deaths (i.e. 12,428) as at 31st of March 2020. Adult HIV prevalence has a significant but weak negative correlation with CFR (correlation coefficient = - 0.24, p value =0.01) while all the other variables have positive correlation with CFR due to COVID-19 though not statistically significant. Of the 204 countries analyzed, only 11 countries (i.e. 5%) had complete datasets across all 5 population level morbidities (i.e. prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy, quality of air, and adult HIV prevalence variables). Correlations of CFR from these 11 countries were similar to that from the 204 countries except for the correlation with quality of air and prevalence of tobacco use. Conclusion: While we interpret our data with caution given the fact that this is an ecological study, our findings suggest that population level factors such as prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy and quality of air are positively correlated with CFR from COVID-19 but, adult HIV prevalence has a weak and negative correlation with COVID-19 CFR and would require extensive research.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"EVAEZI OKPOKORO","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"VICTORIA IGBINOMWANHIA","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"ELIMA JEDY-AGBA","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institue of Human virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"GBENGA KAYODE","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"EZENWA ONYEMATA","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"ALASH'LE ABIMIKU","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Keith Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Anna Llupia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rugh Aguilar","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Selena Alonso","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Diana Barrios","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlo Carolis","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Pau Cistero","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Choliz","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Angeline Cruz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Silvia Fochs","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Chenjerai Jairoce","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Jochen Hecht","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Regulation"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Lamoglia","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Mikel J Martinez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Mitchell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ortega","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Nuria Pey","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Puyol","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Marta Ribes","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Neus Rosell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Patricia Sotomayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Torres","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Williams","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sonia Barroso","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Anna Vilella","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Munoz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Pilar Varela","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlota Dobano","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081885","rel_title":"Control with uncertain data of socially structured compartmental epidemic models","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081885","rel_abs":"The adoption of containment measures to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic. Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. In addition, data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must naturally be incorporated into the models. In this work we address both these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of the epidemiological model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The importance of the timing and intensity of interventions is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people.

Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected earlier, depleting the susceptible subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold (HIT) is reached. Although estimates vary, simple calculations suggest that herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 requires 60-70% of the population to be immune. By fitting epidemiological models that allow for heterogeneity to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across the globe, we show that variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection reduces these estimates. Accurate measurements of heterogeneity are therefore of paramount importance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M. Gabriela M.

Methods 50 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection and 130 controls without corona virus infection from the people's hospital of Chongqing were enrolled in current retrospective study. Four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems including seven IgM\/IgG antibody detection Kits for 2019-nCoV (A_IgM, A_IgG, B_IgM, B_IgG, C_IgM, C_IgG, D_Ab) were employed to detecting antibody concentration. Chi-square test,receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youden's index were demonstrated to verify the cutoff value of each detection system. Results The repeatability verification results of the A, B, C, and D system are all qualified. D-Ab performances best (92% sensitivity and 99.23% specificity), and B_IgM worse than other systems. Except for the system of A_IgM and C_IgG, the optimal diagnostic thresholds and cutoff value of other kits from recommendations are inconsistent with each other. B_IgM got the worst AUC and C_IgG had the best diagnostic accuracy. More importantly, B_IgG system have the highest false positive rate for testing patients with AIDS, tumor and pregnant. A_IgM system test showed highest false positive rates among elder over 90 years old. Conclusions Systems for CoVID-2019 IgM\/IgG antibody test performance difference. Serum diagnosis kit of D-Ab is the most reliable detecting system for 2019-nCoV antibody, which can be used as an alternative method for nucleic acid testing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yafang Wan","author_inst":"Chongqing General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Li","author_inst":"The General Hospital of Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Kun Wang","author_inst":"The General Hospital of Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Tian Li","author_inst":"The General Hospital of Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Pu Liao","author_inst":"The General Hospital of Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Jorge Carneiro","author_inst":"Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Guilherme Goncalves","author_inst":"Universidade do Porto, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Carlos Penha-Goncalves","author_inst":"Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Marcelo U.

Understanding the mode of viral attachment, entry and replication has become a key aspect of such interventions. The coronavirus surface features a trimeric spike (S) protein that is essential for viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry. Herein, we describe glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of hACE2 expressed in HEK293 human cells. We observed high glycan occupancy (73.2 to 100%) at all seven possible N-glycosylation sites and surprisingly detected one novel O-glycosylation site. To deduce the detailed structure of glycan epitopes on hACE2 that may be involved in viral binding, we have characterized the terminal sialic acid linkages, the presence of bisecting GlcNAc, and the pattern of N-glycan fucosylation. We have conducted extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide and glycan spectrum, in addition to using bioinformatics tools to validate the hACE2 glycosylation. Our elucidation of the site-specific glycosylation and its terminal orientations on the hACE2 receptor, along with the modeling of hACE2 glycosylation sites can aid in understanding the intriguing virus-receptor interactions and assist in the development of novel therapeutics to prevent viral entry. The relevance of studying the role of ACE2 is further increased due to some recent reports about the varying ACE2 dependent complications with regard to age, sex, race, and pre-existing conditions of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asif Shajahan","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Stephanie A Archer-Hartmann","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Nitin T Supekar","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Anne S.

There are currently no therapeutic options for mitigating this disease due to lack of a vaccine and limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 biology. As a result, there is an urgent need to create new disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 biology and to screen for therapeutics using human disease-relevant tissues. COVID-19 patients typically present with respiratory symptoms including cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress, but nearly 25% of patients have gastrointestinal indications including anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Moreover, these symptoms are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. Here, we report using human pluripotent stem cell-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the permissiveness of colonic cell types to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell RNA-seq and immunostaining showed that the putative viral entry receptor ACE2 is expressed in multiple hESC-derived colonic cell types, but highly enriched in enterocytes. Multiple cell types in the COs can be infected by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus, which was further validated in vivo using a humanized mouse model. We used hPSC-derived COs in a high throughput platform to screen 1280 FDA-approved drugs against viral infection. Mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride were found to block the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus in COs both in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed to block infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study established both in vitro and in vivo organoid models to investigate infection of SARS-CoV-2 disease-relevant human colonic cell types and identified drugs that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection, suitable for rapid clinical testing.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaohua Duan","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yuling Han","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Liuliu Yang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Nilsson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Wang","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tuo Zhang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xing Wang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Dong Xu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jenny Zhaoying Xiang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"skyler uhl","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yaoxing Huang","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan Chen","author_inst":"the University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, 201210 Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R. tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert  E.

Here we report the rapid adaption of SARS-CoV-2 in BALB\/c mice, based on which a convenient, economical and effective animal model was developed. Specifically, we found that mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 at passage 6 (MACSp6) efficiently infected both aged and young wild-type BALB\/c mice, resulting in moderate pneumonia as well as inflammatory responses. The elevated infectivity of MACSp6 in mice could be attributed to the substitution of a key residue (N501Y) in the receptorbinding domain (RBD). Using this novel animal model, we further evaluated the in vivo protective efficacy of an RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine, which elicited highly potent neutralizing antibodies and conferred full protection against SARS-CoV-2 MACSp6 challenge. This novel mouse model is convenient and effective in evaluating the in vivo protective efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\nSummaryThis study describes a unique mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and confirms protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit vaccine.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongjing Gu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Qi Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lei He","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hang Fan","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yong-qiang Deng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yanxiao Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Teng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Zhongpeng Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yuchang Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Feng Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Jiangfan Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Nana Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guangyu Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiliang Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Deyan Luo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gencheng Han","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuxian He","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Zhou","author_inst":"Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Geng","author_inst":"Beijing Joinn Biologics Co.

However, when the virus enters the body it interacts not only with the host but also with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-host-microbiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by viral invasion. With this aim we carry out a functional analysis of previously published RNA sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from eight COVID-19 patients, twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia patients, and twenty healthy controls. The resulting microbiome functional profiles and their top differentiating features clearly separate the cohorts. By examining the functional features in connection with their associated metabolic pathways, differentially abundant pathways are indicated, compared to both the community-acquired pneumonia and healthy cohorts. From this analysis, distinguishing signatures in COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes are identified, including decreased lipid and glycan metabolism pathways, and increased carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Here we present a framework for comparative functional analysis of microbiomes, the results from which can lead to new hypotheses on the host-microbiome interactions in healthy versus afflicted cohorts. The findings from this analysis call for further research on microbial functions and host-microbiome interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niina Haiminen","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Filippo Utro","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Ed Seabolt","author_inst":"IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Laxmi Parida","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Hang Fan","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yong-qiang Deng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yanxiao Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Teng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Zhongpeng Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yuchang Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Feng Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Jiangfan Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Nana Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guangyu Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiliang Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Deyan Luo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gencheng Han","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuxian He","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Zhou","author_inst":"Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Geng","author_inst":"Beijing Joinn Biologics Co.

Neutrophil activation seems to be crucial in the initiation and perpetuation of this exacerbated lung inflammation. However, the precise mechanisms by which this activation occurs remain yet elusive. To this end, this in silico study tried to identify potential proinflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs) produced by the action of the elastase released in neutrophil-extracellular traps over SARS-CoV-2 particles.

PSGL-1 has been identified as an interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3)-regulated factor that restricts HIV-1 infectivity, and has recently been found to possess broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Here we report that the expression of PSGL-1 in virus-producing cells impairs the incorporation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoproteins into pseudovirions and blocks virus attachment and infection of target cells.

COVID-19 is highly infectious and with high mortality rate. As no effective antiviral treatment is currently available, new drugs are urgently needed. We employed transcriptional analysis to uncover potential antiviral drugs from natural products or FDA approved drugs. We found liquiritin significantly inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with EC50 = 2.39 M. Mechanistically, we found liquiritin exerts anti-viral function by mimicking type I interferon. Upregulated genes induced by liquiritin are enriched in GO categories including type I interferon signaling pathway, negative regulation of viral genome replication and etc. In toxicity experiment, no death was observed when treated at dose of 300 mg\/kg for a week in ICR mice. All the organ indexes but liver and serum biochemical indexes were normal after treatment. Liquiritin is abundant in licorice tablet (~0.2% by mass), a traditional Chinese medicine. Together, we recommend liquiritin as a competitive candidate for treating COVID-19. We also expect liquiritin to have a broad and potent antiviral function to other viral pathogens, like HBV, HIV and etc.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Zhu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yong-Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Feng Li","author_inst":"Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Na-Na Zhang","author_inst":"Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zurui Liu","author_inst":"Gigaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Bowen Zhang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Chengfeng Qin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Zhengwei Xie","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yuchang Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Feng Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Jiangfan Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Nana Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guangyu Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiliang Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Deyan Luo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gencheng Han","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuxian He","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Zhou","author_inst":"Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Geng","author_inst":"Beijing Joinn Biologics Co.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic is an RNA virus prone to mutations. Formation of a stable binding interface between the Spike (S) protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host actuates viral entry. Yet, how this binding interface evolves as virus acquires mutations during pandemic remains elusive. Here, using a high fidelity bioinformatics pipeline, we analysed 31,403 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, and identified 444 non-synonymous mutations that cause 49 distinct amino acid substitutions in the RBD. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested independent emergence of these RBD mutants during pandemic. In silico structure modelling of interfaces induced by mutations on residues which directly engage ACE2 or lie in the near vicinity revealed molecular rearrangements and binding energies unique to each RBD mutant. Comparative structure analysis using binding interface from mouse that prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry uncovered minimal molecular determinants in RBD necessary for the formation of stable interface. We identified that interfacial interaction involving amino acid residues N487 and G496 on either ends of the binding scaffold are indispensable to anchor RBD and are well conserved in all SARS-like corona viruses. All other interactions appear to be required to locally remodel binding interface with varying affinities and thus may decide extent of viral transmission and disease outcome. Together, our findings propose the modalities and variations in RBD-ACE2 interface formation exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for endurance.\n\nImportanceCOVID-19, so far the worst hit pandemic to mankind, started in January 2020 and is still prevailing globally. Our study identified key molecular arrangements in RBD-ACE2 interface that help virus to tolerate mutations and prevail. In addition, RBD mutations identified in this study can serve as a molecular directory for experimental biologists to perform functional validation experiments. The minimal molecular requirements for the formation of RBD-ACE2 interface predicted using in silico structure models may help precisely design neutralizing antibodies, vaccines and therapeutics. Our study also proposes the significance of understanding evolution of protein interfaces during pandemic.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shijulal Nelson-Sathi","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Perunthottathu K Umasankar","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sreekumar Easwaran","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Radhakrishnan R Nair","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnolgoy"},{"author_name":"Iype Joseph","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sai Ravi Chandra Nori","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jamiema Sara Philip","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Roshny Prasad","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kolaparamba V Navyasree","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Shikha Ramesh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Heera Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sanu Gosh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Santhosh Kumar TR","author_inst":"RajiV Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"M Radhakrishna Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guangyu Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiliang Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Deyan Luo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gencheng Han","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuxian He","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Zhou","author_inst":"Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Geng","author_inst":"Beijing Joinn Biologics Co.

Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The sudden appearance of a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause for concern that should motivate stronger international efforts to identify the source and prevent near future re-emergence. Any existing pools of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors would be particularly dangerous if similarly well adapted for human transmission. To look for clues regarding intermediate hosts, we analyze recent key findings relating to how SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved and adapted for human transmission, and examine the environmental samples from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market. Importantly, the market samples are genetically identical to human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and were therefore most likely from human sources. We conclude by describing and advocating for measured and effective approaches implemented in the 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks to identify lingering population(s) of progenitor virus.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shing Hei Zhan","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Benjamin E Deverman","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Yulia Alina Chan","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA"},{"author_name":"Yuchen Bian","author_inst":"Baidu Research USA, Sunnyvale, California, 94089, USA"},{"author_name":"Liang Huang","author_inst":"School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA"},{"author_name":"Jamiema Sara Philip","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Roshny Prasad","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kolaparamba V Navyasree","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Shikha Ramesh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Heera Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sanu Gosh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Santhosh Kumar TR","author_inst":"RajiV Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"M Radhakrishna Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guangyu Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiliang Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Deyan Luo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gencheng Han","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuxian He","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Zhou","author_inst":"Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Geng","author_inst":"Beijing Joinn Biologics Co.

However, given that poor mental health is common in staff working in acute medicine, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of working directly with infected patients during epidemic and pandemic health emergencies. We completed a rapid review of the evidence and identified 74 relevant studies from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Due to varying caseness criteria, a meta-analysis of prevalence was not possible. However, it was clear that levels of self-reported depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related symptoms were high, and somewhat higher in clinical staff working in high exposure roles. To assess the impact of high- versus low-exposure healthcare work more formally, we estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) of scale means using a random effects meta-analysis. High exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low exposure work (anxiety: SMD=0.22, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.38; PTSD symptoms: SMD=0.21, 95% CI 0.01 - 0.4; depression: SMD=0.20, -0.07 - 0.47). This effect was potentially inflated by publication bias and there was a moderate risk of bias in the studies in the meta-analysis. A narrative review of candidate risk factors identified being a nurse, seeing colleagues infected, experiencing quarantine, non-voluntary role assignment, and experiencing stigma, as associated with particularly poor mental health outcomes. Protective factors included team and institutional support, use and faith in infection prevention measures, and a sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Notably, formal psychological support services were valued by frontline staff, although those with the highest burden of mental health difficulties were the least likely to request or receive support.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vaughan Bell","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Dorothy Wade","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals Critical Care Department"},{"author_name":"Yulia Alina Chan","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA"},{"author_name":"Yuchen Bian","author_inst":"Baidu Research USA, Sunnyvale, California, 94089, USA"},{"author_name":"Liang Huang","author_inst":"School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA"},{"author_name":"Jamiema Sara Philip","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Roshny Prasad","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kolaparamba V Navyasree","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Shikha Ramesh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Heera Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sanu Gosh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Santhosh Kumar TR","author_inst":"RajiV Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"M Radhakrishna Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guangyu Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiliang Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Deyan Luo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gencheng Han","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuxian He","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Zhou","author_inst":"Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Geng","author_inst":"Beijing Joinn Biologics Co.

This study uses typhoon eye theory to offer insights in helping clinical psychiatrists to screen people with well-being issues during COVID-19 outbreak. We collected survey data from working adults across different geographical areas in China on 20 and 21 February 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. The sample contains 308 working adults, who were in various parts of China, with varying distance to the epicenter of Wuhan. The distance of individual adults to the epicenter was negatively associated with life satisfaction ({beta} = -0.235, 95% CI -0.450 to -0.020, p = 0.032). This association between distance and life satisfaction was significant only for adults who were young or had smaller family sizes. For example, the negative relationship was strongest when the individuals were in the age bracket of 20 years old (15.7%; {beta} = -0.703, 95% CI -1.098 to -0.307; p = 0.001) and single (32.3%; {beta} = -0.767, 95% CI -1.125 to -0.408; p < 0.001). Our results that well-being deteriorates by the distance from the epicenter for specific groups of people help guide mental healthcare providers towards the regions that are further away from the epicenter in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, our results indicate the practitioners should be cautious of using typhoon eye effect for individuals who were older or had a larger family size.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pok Man Tang","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Stephen X.

Study Design: A dynamic, discrete time, stochastic individual-based model was developed to simulate COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We fit the transmission model to the observed trends in deaths and ICU beds use. Results: If Greece had not implemented the SD measures, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed between 30 March and 4 of April. Additionally, the SD interventions averted 4360 deaths and prevent the healthcare system from overwhelmed. Conclusions: The fast reflexes of the Greek government limit the burden of the Covid-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ilias Gountas","author_inst":"University of Peloponnese"},{"author_name":"Georgios Hillas","author_inst":"5th Pulmonary Department, Sotiria Chest Diseases Hospital, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Kyriakos Souliotis","author_inst":"Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, University of Peloponnese, Corinth, Greece.  & Health Policy Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Feng Wei","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Yuchen Bian","author_inst":"Baidu Research USA, Sunnyvale, California, 94089, USA"},{"author_name":"Liang Huang","author_inst":"School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA"},{"author_name":"Jamiema Sara Philip","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Roshny Prasad","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kolaparamba V Navyasree","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Shikha Ramesh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Heera Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sanu Gosh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Santhosh Kumar TR","author_inst":"RajiV Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"M Radhakrishna Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guangyu Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiliang Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Deyan Luo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gencheng Han","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuxian He","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Zhou","author_inst":"Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Geng","author_inst":"Beijing Joinn Biologics Co.
