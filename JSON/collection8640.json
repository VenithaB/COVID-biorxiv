The number of cases outside China is now growing fast, while in mainland China the virus outbreak is largely under control. We review the epidemic virus growth and decline curves in China using a phenomenological logistic growth model to summarize the outbreak dynamics using three parameters that characterize the epidemic's timing, rate and peak. During the initial phase, the number of virus cases doubled every 2.7 (range 2.2 - 4.4) days. The rate of increase in the number of reported cases peaked approximately 10 days after suppression measures were started on 23-25 January 2020. The peak in the number of reported sick cases occurred on average 18 days after the start of measures. From the time of starting measures till the peak, the number of cases increased by a factor 39 in the province Hubei, and by a factor 9.5 for all of China (range: 6.2-20.4 in the other provinces). Complete suppression took up to 2 months (range: 23-57d.), during which period severe restrictions, social distancing measures, testing and isolation of cases were in place. The suppression of the disease in China has been successful, demonstrating that suppression is a viable strategy to contain SARS-CoV2.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yi Zou","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Pan","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"},{"author_name":"Peng Zhao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"},{"author_name":"Lei Han","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxiang Wang","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lia Hemerik","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"Johannes Knops","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"},{"author_name":"Wopke van der Werf","author_inst":"Wageningen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040071","rel_title":"A special case of COVID-19 with long duration of viral shedding for 49 days","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20040071","rel_abs":"Prolonged viral shedding is associated with severe status and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

There is no highly effective medicine or vaccine, most of the patients were recovered by their own immune response, especially the virus specific IgG and IgM responses. However, the IgG\/ IgM responses is barely known. To enable the global understanding of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG\/ IgM responses, a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed. The microarray was applied to profile the IgG\/ IgM responses with 29 convalescent sera. The results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients had IgG\/ IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2, especially to protein N, S1 but not S2. S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate COVID-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to ORF9b and NSP5 were also identified. In-depth analysis showed that the level of S1 IgG positively correlate to age and the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), especially for women, while the level of S1 IgG negatively correlate to Ly% (Lymphocyte percentage). This study presents the first whole picture of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG\/ IgM responses, and provides insights to develop precise immuno-diagnostics, effective treatment and vaccine.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"He-wei Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"},{"author_name":"Hai-nan Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, Foshan 528000, China"},{"author_name":"Dong Men","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of RNA Biology, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China"},{"author_name":"Huan Qi","author_inst":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, Foshan 528000, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20039933","rel_title":"COVID-19 outbreak response: a first assessment of mobility changes in Italy following national lockdown","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20039933","rel_abs":"Italy is currently experiencing the largest COVID-19 outbreak in Europe so far, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases.

SARS-CoV-2 uses the membrane protein Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. Indeed, it was reported that the balance of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), regulated by both ACE and ACE2, was altered in COVID-19 patients. It is controversial, however, whether commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) shall be continued in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate any difference in disease severity between COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity. The included COVID-19 patients used ACEI, ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), beta blockers (BB), or thiazide to treat preexisting hypertension prior to the hospital were compared to patients who did not take any of those drugs. Methods In this multicentre retrospective study, clinical data of 511 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Patients were categorized into six sub-groups of hypertension comorbidity based on treatment using one of anti-hypertension drugs (ACEI, ARB, CCB, BB, thiazide), or none. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the use of ACEI and ARB associated with pneumonia using published studies. Findings Among the elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19-S (severe disease) was significantly decreased in patients who took ARB drugs prior to hospitalization compared to patients who took no drugs (OR=0.343, 95% CI 0.128-0.916, p=0.025). The meta-analysis showed that ARB use has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of pneumonia. Interpretation Elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity who are taking ARB anti-hypertension drugs may be less likely to develop severe lung disease compared to patients who take no anti-hypertension drugs.

Updated analysis of cases might help identify the characteristic and risk factors of the illness severity. METHODS We extracted data regarding 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 18, 2020. The degree of severity of COVID-19 patients (severe vs. non-severe) was defined at the time of admission according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). RESULTS The median age was 64.91 years, 26 cases (55.31%) were male of which, and 70.83% were severe cases. Severe patients had higher APACHE II (9.92 vs 4.74) and SOFA (3.0 vs 1.0) scores on admission, as well as the higher PSI (86.13 vs 61.39), Curb-65 (1.14 vs 0.48) and CT semiquantitative scores (5.0 vs 2.0) when compared with non-severe patients. Among all univariable parameters, APACHE II, SOFA, lymphocytes, CRP, LDH, AST, cTnI, BNP, et al were significantly independent risk factors of COVID-19 severity. Among which, LDH was most positively related both with APACHE II (R = 0.682) and SOFA (R = 0.790) scores, as well as PSI (R = 0.465) and CT (R = 0.837) scores. To assess the diagnostic value of these selected parameters, LDH (0.9727) had maximum sensitivity (100.00%) and specificity (86.67%), with the cutoff value of 283. As a protective factor, lymphocyte counts less than 1.045 x 109 \/L showed a good accuracy for identification of severe patients with AUC = 0.9845 (95%CI 0.959-1.01), the maximum specificity (91.30%) and sensitivity (95.24%). In addition, LDH was positively correlated with CRP, AST, BNP and cTnI, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte cells and its subsets, including CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that LDH coule be identified as a powerful predictive factor for early recognition of lung injury and severe COVID-19 cases. And importantly, lymphocyte counts, especially CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, which was relevant with serum LDH, were also dynamically correlated with the severity of the disease.

However, there is a lack of epidemiological tools to guide effective public policy development. Here we present epidemiological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 S type exited Wuhan or other epicenters in China earlier than L type and conferred partial resistance to the virus on infected populations. Analysis of regional disparities in incidence has revealed that a sharp decline in influenza epidemics is a useful surrogate indicator for the undocumented spread of SARS-CoV-2. The biggest concern in the world is knowing when herd immunity has been achieved and scheduling a time to regain the living activities of each country. This study provides a useful tool to guide the development of local policies to contain the virus.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yasuhiko Kamikubo","author_inst":"Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Takahashi","author_inst":"Kibi International University"},{"author_name":"Wan-Jin Yeo","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chaoyuan Jin","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Xue","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chaoyang Tong","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunfei Zha","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenju Song","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital,Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

This study aimed to assess the disease status of IBD patients in Hubei province by questionnaire online and guide to the self-management of IBD patients during this epidemic. Methods: A questionnaire was designed containing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), the Partial Mayo Score (PMS), the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and distributed to Hubei IBD patients online within one month of traffic control after the outbreak of COVID-19. This questionnaire also included some questions about patients' self-report disease conditions and their epidemiological history of COVID-19. Results: A total of 102 eligible questionnaires were included in the analysis. No patient reported infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in our study. Our result showed that 69.64% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 80.44% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were in remission. There was not a statistically significant difference in the proportion of the active disease stage between the two types of disease (p=0.103). The majority of patients (85.29%) had a good health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SIBDQ[&ge;]50). The reduction in physical exercise is a risk factor for worsening in conditions (OR=17.593, 95%CI 2.035 to 152.097, p=0.009). Conclusions: The outbreak of COVID-19 might not have a significant impact on most Hubei IBD patients within one month after the traffic control. The patient's disease condition could be assessed by our questionnaires. Doctors utilized the information and advised for IBD patients about self-management during the period of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meiping Yu","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, P"},{"author_name":"Zhenghao Ye","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, P"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, P"},{"author_name":"Tingting Qin","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiguang Kou","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Xiaogan Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dean Tian","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fang Xiao","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yunfei Zha","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenju Song","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital,Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

No studies have yet summarised the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We synthesised a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 6.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22\/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409\/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31\/139) of current smokers and 46% (13\/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%. Conclusion: Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaber S Alqahtani","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Tope Oyelade","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Abdulelah M Aldhahir","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Saeed M Alghamdi","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mater Almehmadi","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Abdullah S Alqahtani","author_inst":"Nottingham University"},{"author_name":"Shumonta Quaderi","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Swapna Mandal","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hurst","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

Our goal is to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. the true number of people currently infected with the virus, divided by the total population size. Our analysis suggests that as of March 17, 2020, there are 6,500 infections (0.34% of the population) of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Based on adjusting the parameters of our model to be optimistic (respectively pessimistic), the number of infections would be 1,400 (resp. 26,000), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.08% (resp. 1.36%). If the shelter-in-place led to R0 < 1, we would expect the number of infections to remain about constant for the next few weeks. However, even if this were true, we expect to continue to see an increase in hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in the short term due to the fact that infection of SARS-CoV-2 on March 17th can lead to hospitalizations up to 14 days later.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steve Yadlowsky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nigam Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jacob Steinhardt","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Saeed M Alghamdi","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mater Almehmadi","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Abdullah S Alqahtani","author_inst":"Nottingham University"},{"author_name":"Shumonta Quaderi","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Swapna Mandal","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hurst","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms, or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries. We estimate that clinical symptoms occur in 25% (95% CrI: 19-32%) of infections in 10-19-year-olds, rising to 76% (68-82%) in over-70s, and that susceptibility to infection in under-20s is approximately half that of older adults. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children may have a relatively small impact on total cases, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility we have estimated has implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19 because of demographic differences across settings: in younger populations, the expected clinical attack rate would be lower, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will affect disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with older populations may see disproportionally more clinical cases, particularly in the later stages of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Swapna Mandal","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hurst","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

This study sought to elucidate a novel predictor of disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cased by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients enrolled in this study were all hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed. The outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia and those with non-severe pneumonia were compared using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to explore clinical characteristics and risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to screen optimal predictors from the risk factors and the predictive power was verified by internal validation. Results: A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 117 with severe pneumonia and 260 with non-severe pneumonia. The independent risk factors for severe pneumonia were age [odds ratio (OR): 1.059, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.036-1.082; p < 0.001], N\/L (OR: 1.322, 95% CI: 1.180-1.481; p < 0.001), CRP (OR: 1.231, 95% CI: 1.129-1.341; p = 0.002), and D-dimer (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.013-1.107; p = 0.011). We identified a product of N\/L*CRP*D-dimer as having an important predictive value for the severity of COVID-19. The cutoff value was 5.32. The negative predictive value of less than 5.32 for the N\/L*CRP*D-dimer was 93.75%, while the positive predictive value was 46.03% in the test sets. The sensitivity and specificity were 89.47% and 67.42%. In the training sets, the negative and positive predictive values were 93.80% and 41.32%, respectively, with a specificity of 70.76% and a sensitivity of 89.87%.

If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contrast between the commitment of researchers to doing important research and their reporting practices reveals underlying weaknesses in reporting habits, but not necessarily their science.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Josh Q Sumner","author_inst":"Ripeta, LLC"},{"author_name":"Leah Haynes","author_inst":"Ripeta, LLC"},{"author_name":"Sarah Nathan","author_inst":"Ripeta, LLC"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Hudson-Vitale","author_inst":"Ripeta, LLC"},{"author_name":"Leslie D McIntosh","author_inst":"Ripeta"},{"author_name":"Seyed Kamran Kamrava","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Maryam Jalessi","author_inst":"Skull base research center, The five senses institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Mohebbi","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rafieh Alizadeh","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran"},{"author_name":"Ali Asghar Honarmand","author_inst":"Electronic learning Committee, Iran Medical Council"},{"author_name":"Babak Ghalehbaghi","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Salimi","author_inst":"Department of anesthesiology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

Here we show that it is possible to predict when the intensive care units will saturate, within a few days from the first cases of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Using early counts of intensive care patients, we predict the saturation for Lombardy, Italy. Governments should use the Italian outbreak as a precedent and implement appropriate containment measures to prevent the saturation of their intensive care units and protect their population, also, and above all, in anticipation of a possible second rapid spread of infections.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mariano Supino","author_inst":"Universite de Paris - IPGP - CNRS"},{"author_name":"Alberto d'Onofrio","author_inst":"International Prevention Research Institute, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Federico Luongo","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Fisica Ettore Pancini, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Occhipinti","author_inst":"Universite de Paris - Institut de Physique du Globe, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Alma Dal Co","author_inst":"Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Cambridge, USA"},{"author_name":"Seyed Kamran Kamrava","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Maryam Jalessi","author_inst":"Skull base research center, The five senses institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Mohebbi","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rafieh Alizadeh","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran"},{"author_name":"Ali Asghar Honarmand","author_inst":"Electronic learning Committee, Iran Medical Council"},{"author_name":"Babak Ghalehbaghi","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Salimi","author_inst":"Department of anesthesiology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

Methods: A preliminary list of outcomes were developed after a systematic review of protocols of clinical trials for COVID-19. Then, two rounds of the Delphi survey were conducted. Stakeholders were traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) experts, Western medicine (WM) experts, nurses and the public. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were also invited to participate in a questionnaire written in understandable language. Frontline clinicians, as well as nurse, methodologist, evidence based-medicine researcher, and staff from the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry participated by video conference to vote. Results: Ninety-seven eligible study protocols were identified from 160 clinical trials. Seventy-six outcomes were identified from TCM clinical trials and 126 outcomes were identified from WM clinical trials. Finally, 145 outcomes were included in the first round of the Delphi survey. Then, a COS for clinical trials of TCM and WM was developed. The COS include clinical outcomes (recovery\/improvement\/progression\/death), etiology (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic-acid tests, viral load), inflammatory factor (C-reactive protein), vital signs (temperature, respiration), blood and lymphatic-system parameters (lymphocytes, virus antibody), respiratory outcomes (Pulmonary imaging, blood oxygen saturation, PaO2\/FiO2 ratio, arterial blood gas analysis, mechanical ventilation, oxygen intake, pneumonia severity index), clinical efficacy (prevalence of preventing patients with mild-to-moderate disease progressing to severe disease), symptoms (clinical symptom score). Outcomes were recommended according to different types of disease. Outcome measurement instrument\/definition were also recommended. Conclusion: A COS for COVID-19 may improve consistency of outcome reporting in clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruijin Qiu","author_inst":"Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chen Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Basic Research In Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tengxiao Liang","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Xuezeng Hao","author_inst":"Cardiology Department, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Ya Huang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Zhao Chen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Xuxu Wei","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Mengzhu Zhao","author_inst":"First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Changming Zhong","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Jiayuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Third Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Songjie Han","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Tianmai He","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Baokang Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin China."},{"author_name":"Hongcai Shang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Chengyu Jiang","author_inst":"Institute of Basic Medical Science Chinese Academy of Medical Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20039438","rel_title":"Evaluation of COVID-19 RT-qPCR test in multi-sample pools","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20039438","rel_abs":"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 lead to a current pandemic of unprecedented levels.

There is limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidities for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has important implications for early treatment. Objective: Evaluate the risk of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design. A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in locations outside of Hubei Province, China, between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 2020 were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and age (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse-probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard model was performed. Results: History of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% higher risk of death (p<0.001). The estimated mortality risk in patients with CHD was three times of those without CHD (p<0.001). The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-year-old female with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI [0.34-0.82]), while it was 0.85 (95% CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased death risk: every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001).

A very large group of patients infected by HBV has been reported worldwide, especially in China. In order to answer whether specific treatment strategy on the patients coinfected with HBV and SARS-CoV-2, it requires profound understanding of the clinical characteristics on those patients. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HBV patients remain largely unknown. Approach & Results In this retrospective investigation, we included 123 COVID-19 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 5 to March 7, 2020. All enrolled patients are the laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases according to the criteria reported previously. A total of 123 patients were analyzed for their Clinical records, laboratory results including the diagnosis of HBV infection and liver function. Among 123 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 51 years old and 59.3% were females (73\/123). Fifteen were previously HBV infected patients, 66.7% of them were males (10\/15), patients with HBV infection appeared to have a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis and an increased level of total bilirubin. Seven (46.7%) patients with HBV infection were defined as severe cases, while the severity rate was 24.1% for the patients without HBV infection (26\/108). The mortality of patients with HBV infection was 13.3% (2\/15) compared to 2.8% (3\/108) for the patients without HBV infection. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause liver function damage in COVID-19 cases and the patients with HBV infection are likely to have more severe disease outcome.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoping Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qunqun Jiang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Ma","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxin Ling","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Zoonosis Science Center, University of Uppsala"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Hu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qian Cao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Pingzheng Mo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Rongrong Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, 171 65, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Yongxi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Moran Szwarcwort-Cohen","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Roy Kishony","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongcai Shang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Chengyu Jiang","author_inst":"Institute of Basic Medical Science Chinese Academy of Medical Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20042184","rel_title":"Serological diagnostic kit of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using CHO-expressed full-length SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20042184","rel_abs":"WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic with more than 300,000 confirmed cases and more than 14,000 deaths.

For indirect ELISA, CHO-expressed recombinant full length SARS-CoV-2-S1 protein with 6*His tag was used as the coating antigen to capture the SARS-CoV-2-S1 antibodies specifically. The specificity of the ELISA kit was determined to be 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human sera including 257 samples collected prior to the outbreak and 155 collected during the outbreak. The sensitivity of the ELISA kit was determined to be 97.5% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and\/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. Most importantly, in one case study, the ELISA test kit was able to identify an infected person who had previously been quarantined for 14 days after coming into contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, and discharged after testing negative twice by nucleic acid test.

Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society, but their benefits cannot be directly observed and are currently understood only through process-based simulations. Here, we compile new data on 1,717 local, regional, and national non-pharmaceutical interventions deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 38% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. Some policies have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large, beneficial, and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that across these six countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 62 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting roughly 530 million total infections. These findings may help inform whether or when these policies should be deployed, intensified, or lifted, and they can support decision-making in the other 180+ countries where COVID-19 has been reported.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Solomon Hsiang","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Daniel Allen","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Annan-Phan","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kendon Bell","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Ian Bolliger","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Trinetta Chong","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Hannah Druckenmiller","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Andrew Hultgren","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Luna Yue Huang","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Emma Krasovich","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Peiley Lau","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jaecheol Lee","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Esther Rolf","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Tseng","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Wu","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Wen Jing Cao","author_inst":"Bengbu Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20040667","rel_title":"COVID-19 in Canada: Predictions for the future and control lessons from Asia","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20040667","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has spread with unequal efficiency in various parts of the world. In several European countries including Italy, the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has followed a consistent, exponential pattern of spread. However, some countries, notably Taiwan and Hong Kong, have achieved a different outcome and have managed to bring the COVID-19 outbreak in their countries rapidly under control, without entering the exponential pattern and with very few cases. They have used several different approaches to COVID-19 outbreak control, including the innovative use of smartphone technology and the widespread use of surgical face masks. We show through our models, that Canada has followed the same, consistent COVID-19 exponential growth pattern that is seen in Italy. Both nationally and in its most heavily affected provinces, there is exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, making it possible to make predictions for the future, if no further interventions are made in public health policy. In particular, we argue for the urgent introduction of surgical face masks in health care and other settings and the harnessing of the power of smartphone technology on a national scale.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cornelius Christian","author_inst":"Brock University"},{"author_name":"Francis Christian","author_inst":"University of Saskatchewan"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Annan-Phan","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kendon Bell","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Ian Bolliger","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Trinetta Chong","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Hannah Druckenmiller","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Andrew Hultgren","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Luna Yue Huang","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Emma Krasovich","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Peiley Lau","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jaecheol Lee","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Esther Rolf","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Tseng","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Wu","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Wen Jing Cao","author_inst":"Bengbu Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041913","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in 86 healthcare workers in two Dutch hospitals in March 2020","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041913","rel_abs":"Background On February 27, 2020, the first patient with COVID-19 was reported in the Netherlands. During the following weeks, nine healthcare workers (HCWs) were diagnosed with COVID-19 in two Dutch teaching hospitals, eight of whom had no history of travel to China or Northern-Italy. A low-threshold screening regimen was implemented to determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs in these two hospitals. Methods HCWs who suffered from fever or respiratory symptoms were voluntarily tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Findings Thirteen-hundred fifty-three (14%) of 9,705 HCWs employed were tested, 86 (6%) of whom were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most HCWs suffered from relatively mild disease and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Seventy-nine (92%) HCWs met a case definition of fever and\/or coughing and\/or shortness of breath. None of the HCWs identified through the screening reported a travel history to China or Northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported to have been exposed to an inpatient known with COVID-19 prior to the onset of symptoms. Interpretation Within two weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with SARS-CoV-2, probably caused by acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, asks for less stringent use of the currently recommended case-definition for suspected COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marjolein Kluytmans","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anton Buiting","author_inst":"Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Suzan Pas","author_inst":"Bravis Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robbert Bentvelsen","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wouter van den Bijllaardt","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne van Oudheusden","author_inst":"Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miranda van Rijen","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jaco Verweij","author_inst":"Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jan Kluytmans","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peiley Lau","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jaecheol Lee","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Esther Rolf","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Tseng","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Wu","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Wen Jing Cao","author_inst":"Bengbu Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20040493","rel_title":"Modelling SARS-CoV-2 Dynamics: Implications for Therapy","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20040493","rel_abs":"The scientific community is focussed on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat \/ nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal \/ sputum \/ tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects. Our unique mathematical approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which are useful for development of antiviral therapies.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kwang Su Kim","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Keisuke Ejima","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Ito","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shoya Iwanami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Ohashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Koizumi","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Asai","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shinji Nakaoka","author_inst":"Faculty of Advanced Life Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Koichi Watashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Robin N Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Jaecheol Lee","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Esther Rolf","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Tseng","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Wu","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Wen Jing Cao","author_inst":"Bengbu Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20040501","rel_title":"Climate affects global patterns of COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20040501","rel_abs":"Environmental factors, including seasonal climatic variability, can strongly impact on spatio-temporal patterns of infectious disease outbreaks, but relationships between Covid-19 dynamics and climate remain controversial.

Here we show that Covid-19 growth rates peaked in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere with mean temperature of ~5 C, and specific humidity of 4-6 g\/m3 during the outbreak period, while they were lower both in warmer\/wetter and colder\/dryer regions. Relationships between Covid-19 and climate were robust to the potential confounding effects of air pollution and socio-economic variables, including population size, density and health expenditure.

Methods Individual demographic data, clinical outcomes, laboratory investigations of pregnant women and their newborns were collected from electronic medical records of the Maternal and Children Health Hospital of Hubei Province, during January 24 to February 29, 2020. Anaesthesia and surgery results were compared between pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection. Results Using CSEA in cesarean section was effective and safe for pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection. Administration of dezocine and morphine was effective as postoperative analgesia, and well tolerated in COVID-19 patients. The assessment of surgery outcomes also showed similar results in both confirmed and suspected cases. No respiratory failure nor distress were found in the mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection and their neonates. None of these patients experienced severe obstetric complications related to anaesthesia and surgeries. No COVID-19 infection was reported in the neonates born to the mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection and healthcare workers in these operations.

After propensity score matching with demographics, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of parturients with or without COVID-19 were analysed. The anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes of themselves and their infants were compared in these two groups of parturients. Results: A total of 1,588 patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing cesarean delivery were retrospectively included. After achieving a balanced cohort through propensity score matching, 89 patients (COVID-19 group), who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test and CT scan matched with 173 patients without COVID-19 (Control group). The SARS-CoV-2 infected parturients in the early stages of COVID-19 outbreak was much more than during the later stage. The main clinical characteristics of parturients with COVID-19 were fever (34.8%), cough (33.7%), an increased plasma CRP (52.8%) and a decreased lymphocyte counting (33.7%). A high rate of emergency and a high incidence of anaesthesia-related complications, such as pharyngalgia, multiple puncture, intraoperative hypotension, nausea, vomiting, vertigo and chills in the COVID-19 parturients. In addition, the parturients with COVID-19 had a long duration of operation and hospital stay, and an increased intraoperative oxytocin utilization and postoperative oxygen therapy. The newborns from the SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, who received general anaesthesia, had a high risk of Apgar score [&le;]8 at 1 and 5 minutes after delivery and a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission.
