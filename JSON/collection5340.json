This deluge of information makes it hard for researchers to keep track of their own field, let alone explore new directions. Standard search engines are designed primarily for targeted search and are not geared for discovery or making connections that are not obvious from reading individual papers.\n\nIn this paper, we present our ongoing work on SciSight, a novel framework for exploratory search of COVID-19 research. Based on formative interviews with scientists and a review of existing tools, we build and integrate two key capabilities: first, exploring interactions between biomedical facets (e.g., proteins, genes, drugs, diseases, patient characteristics); and second, discovering groups of researchers and how they are connected. We extract entities using a language model pre-trained on several biomedical information extraction tasks, and enrich them with data from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). To find research groups automatically, we use hierarchical clustering with overlap to allow authors, as they do, to belong to multiple groups. Finally, we introduce a novel presentation of these groups based on both topical and social affinities, allowing users to drill down from groups to papers to associations between entities, and update query suggestions on the fly with the goal of facilitating exploratory navigation.\n\nSciSight1 has thus far served over 10K users with over 30K page views and 13% returning users. Preliminary user interviews with biomedical researchers suggest that SciSight complements current approaches and helps find new and relevant knowledge.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Hope","author_inst":"Allen Institute for AI"},{"author_name":"Jason Portenoy","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kishore Vasan","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Borchardt","author_inst":"Allen Institute for AI"},{"author_name":"Eric Horvitz","author_inst":"Microsoft Research"},{"author_name":"Daniel S.

Molecular epidemiology can help monitor and adapting traditional surveillance to surpass those limitations. This work aims to contrast data-driven from traditional surveillance with parameters inferred from molecular epidemiology in Latin America (LATAM) Methods: We obtained epidemiological data up to 4th June 2020. We estimated Effective Reproductive Number (Re) and epidemic curves using maximum likelihood (ML). SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from GISAID up to June 4th 2020. We aligned sequences and generated ML phylogenetic tree, and ran a coalescent model Birth Death SIR. The phylodynamic analysis was performed for inferring Re, the number of infections and the date of introduction. Findings: A total of 1,144,077 cases were reported up to 4th June 2020. Countries with the largest cumulative cases were Chile, Peru and Panama. We found at least 18 different lineages circulating, with a predominance of B.1 and B.1.1. We inferred an underestimation of the daily incident cases. When contrasting observed and inferred Re, we did not find statistically significant differences except for Chile and Mexico. Temporal analysis of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 suggested a detection lag of at least 21 days. Interpretation: Our results support that epidemiological and genomic surveillance are two complementary approaches. Even with a low number of genomes, proper estimations of Re could be performed. We suggest that countries, especially developing countries, should consider adding genomic surveillance to their systems for monitoring and adapting epidemiological control of SARS-CoV-2.

Evolutionary dynamics, gene-specific phylogeny and emergence of the novel co-evolving mutations in nine structural and non-structural genes among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains in ten states of India have been assessed.\n\nMaterials and methods46 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences submitted from India were downloaded from the GISAID (39\/46) or from NCBI (7\/46) database. Phylogenetic study and analyses of mutation were based on the nine structural and non-structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. Secondary structure of RdRP\/NSP12 protein was predicted with respect to the novel A97V mutation.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses revealed the evolution of \"genome-type clusters\" and adaptive selection of \"L\" type SARS-CoV-2 strains with genetic closeness to the bat SARS-like coronaviruses than pangolin or MERS-CoVs. With regards to the novel co-evolving mutations, 2 groups are seen to circulate in India at present: the \"major group\" (52.2%) and the \"minor group\" (30.4%), harboring four and five co-existing mutations, respectively. The \"major group\" mutations fall in the A2a clade. All the minor group mutations, except 11083G>T (L37F, NSP6) were unique to the Indian isolates.\n\nConclusionThe study highlights rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and co-circulation of multiple clades and sub-clades, driving this pandemic worldwide.

To develop a therapeutic drug for COVID-19, a model that can reproduce the viral life cycle and evaluate the drug efficacy of anti-viral drugs is essential. In this study, we established a method to generate human bronchial organoids (hBO) from commercially available cryopreserved human bronchial epithelial cells and examined whether they could be used as a model for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) research. Our hBO contain basal, club, ciliated, and goblet cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2), which is an essential serine protease for priming spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, were highly expressed. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, not only the intracellular viral genome, but also progeny virus, cytotoxicity, pyknotic cells, and moderate increases of the type I interferon signal could be observed. Treatment with camostat, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, reduced the viral copy number to 2% of the control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile in SARS-CoV-2-infected hBO was obtained by performing RNA-seq analysis. In conclusion, we succeeded in generating hBO that can be used for SARS-CoV-2 research and COVID-19 drug discovery.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/115600v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (99K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13a6908org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c59300org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@362167org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cb31ed_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tatsuya Suzuki","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Yumi Ito","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Sakai","author_inst":"Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University"},{"author_name":"Akatsuki Saito","author_inst":"Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki"},{"author_name":"Daisuke Okuzaki","author_inst":"Osaka University Research Institute for Microbial Diseases"},{"author_name":"Daisuke Motooka","author_inst":"Osaka University Research Institute for Microbial Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shohei Minami","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Kobayashi","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamamoto","author_inst":"Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Toru Okamoto","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Kazuo Takayama","author_inst":"Kyoto University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111013","rel_title":"Noninvasive respiratory support in acute hypoxemicrespiratory failure associated with COVID-19 and other viralinfections","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111013","rel_abs":"Introduction: Noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) such as noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and high flow nasal therapy (HFNT) have been used in the treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and other viral infections. However, there is a lack of consensus in favor of or against NRS use due to the risks of worsening hypoxemia, intubation delay, and aerosols environmental contamination associated with the use of these tools. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the use of NRS in adult patients with COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia (i.e. H1N1, SARS, MERS) and AHRF. We also searched for studies evaluating the risk of aerosolization\/contamination with these tools. Evidence Acquisition: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed EMBASE and two major preprint servers (biorXiv and medRxiv) from inception to April 14, 2020, for studies on the use of respiratory support in AHRF and viral pneumonia. Evidence Synthesis: The search identified 4086 records and we found only one randomized controlled trial out of 58 studies included, with great variabilities in support utilization and failure rates. Fifteen studies explored the issue of aerosolization\/contamination showing a high risk of airborne transmission via droplets generation during the use of these modalities Conclusions: Use of NRS and treatment failure in the context of COVID-19 and viral infection associated-AHRF, varied widely. Dispersion of exhaled air is different depending on the type of respiratory therapies and interfaces.

Covid-19 may cause fatality especially among elderly, and people with chronic health problems. After human to human transmissions of the disease, it has rapidly spread throughout China, and then the outbreak has reached to neighboring countries in Asia. Now, the spread of the virus is accelerating in the world, and increasing number of new cases has been reported daily in Europe, Middle East, Africa and America regions. Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) also announced Covid-19 as a Pandemic. As of 3 April, worldwide around more than 1 million cases and around 60,000 fatalities are reported. Thus, forecasting regional and worldwide outbreak size of Covid-19 is important in order to take necessary actions regarding to preparedness plans and mitigation interventions. In this work, we design a deep learning model, which is an effective artificial intelligence method, to provide regional and worldwide forecasts. Particularly for worldwide, our approach predicts the cumulative number of cases, cumulative number of deaths and daily new cases. For Europe and Middle East regions, we predict the cumulative number of cases, and for Mainland China we predict daily new cases and the cumulative number of deaths. We predict the next 10 days based on the previously reported actual time series data of Covid-19. For worldwide forecasts, we use the data provided by Worldometers. For Europe and Middle East forecasts, we use the data provided by World Health Organization, and for China Mainland forecasts, the data is obtained from Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the first time that a deep learning model has been employed for Covid-19 spread prediction, solely based on the known reported cases of Covid-19. The proposed deep learning architecture consists of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layers to predict regional and worldwide forecasts. We evaluate our approach with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. For forecasting, we use the network models that give the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days of actual data. Networks, which achieves the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days, are used to predict the next 10 days. Every day, the spread and situations are changing. Our approach can take into account these real-time changes; the deep learning model can be re-trained with new daily data and perform real-time forecasting. Results show that the proposed deep learning model is promising, it can predict possible scenarios regionally and globally for the spread of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cem Direkoglu","author_inst":"Middle East Technical University - Northern Cyprus Campus"},{"author_name":"Melike Sah","author_inst":"Near East University"},{"author_name":"Zeyi Zhang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Liu","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jianwei Cheng","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Fengjiao Ding","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiaofei Wang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Lun Xi","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuang Wang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xichong Yan","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Rongkun Zhang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Fangxing Ouyang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hui Ding","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Tianyi Ke","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.116608","rel_title":"Structure, function and variants analysis of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2, a drug target candidate for COVID-19 infection","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.116608","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus causing mainly respiratory, but also gastrointestinal symptoms. Elucidating the molecular processes underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how the genetic background of an individual is responsible for the variability in clinical presentation and severity of COVID-19 is essential in understanding this disease.\n\nCell infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires binding of its Spike (S) protein to the ACE2 cell surface protein and priming of the S by the serine protease TMPRSS2. One may expect that genetic variants leading to a defective TMPRSS2 protein can affect SARS-CoV-2 ability to infect cells. We used a range of bioinformatics methods to estimate the prevalence and pathogenicity of TMPRSS2 genetic variants in the human population, and assess whether TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are co-expressed in the intestine, similarly to what is observed in lungs.\n\nWe generated a 3D structural model of the TMPRSS2 extracellular domain using the prediction server Phyre and studied 378 naturally-occurring TMPRSS2 variants reported in the GnomAD database. One common variant, p.V160M (rs12329760), is predicted damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen2 and has a MAF of 0.25. Valine 160 is a highly conserved residue within the SRCS domain. The SRCS is found in proteins involved in host defence, such as CD5 and CD6, but its role in TMPRSS2 remains unknown. 84 rare variants (53 missense and 31 leading to a prematurely truncated protein, cumulative minor allele frequency (MAF) 7.34x10-4) cause structural destabilization and possibly protein misfolding, and are also predicted damaging by SIFT and PolyPhen2 prediction tools. Moreover, we extracted gene expression data from the human protein atlas and showed that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the small intestine, duodenum and colon, as well as the kidneys and gallbladder.\n\nThe implications of our study are that: i. TMPRSS2 variants, in particular p.V160M with a MAF of 0.25, should be investigated as a possible marker of disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19 and ii. in vitro validation of the co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in gastro-intestinal is warranted.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessia David","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tarun Khanna","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Melina Beykou","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gordon Hanna","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael J.E.

Methods This is a retrospective study of 6 COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma at Guizhou Provincial Jiangjunshan Hospital [boxh] a tertial hospital, in Guiyang, Guizhou, China, from January 29, to April 30, 2020; final data of follow-up was May 12, 2020. Through the review of the electronic medical records of Guizhou Jiangjunshan Hospital, clinical data of 6 patients were obtained. Three patients with worsening symptoms after empirical treatment with antivirals were transfused convalescent plasma therapy for the first treatment, while the other three severe or critical COVID-19 patients with rapid progression were transfused. The efficacy of convalescent plasma depends on the relief of symptoms, changes in laboratory indicators and chest imaging abnormalities. Results The PaO2 \/ FiO2 and lymphocyte count of patients 1, 2 and 3 treated with convalescent plasma treatment for the first treatment period were changed from abnormal to normal. The levels of inflammation markers CRP and IL-6 of the patients decreased significantly. Chest imaging examination showed that the lung lesions gradually subsided. The relapsed patients (No. 4 and No. 6), after using convalescent plasma therapy, turned negative on two consecutive throat swab tests on Day 24 and Day 3, respectively. Conclusions Convalescent plasma treatment of COVID-19 is beneficial for those patients with be difficult to turn to negative or re-positive RT-PCR.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Can Jin","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Juan Gu","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Youshu Yuan","author_inst":"Guizhou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qinying Long","author_inst":"Guizhou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Guizhou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hourong Zhou","author_inst":"Guizhou Provincial People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weidong Wu","author_inst":"Guizhou Normal College"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chuang Wang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xichong Yan","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Rongkun Zhang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Fangxing Ouyang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hui Ding","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Tianyi Ke","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.116020","rel_title":"Simeprevir suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication and synergizes with remdesivir","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.116020","rel_abs":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global threat to human health.

Analysis of these genes, present in network, highlights their biological functions and related cellular pathways. With the assistance of these information, a drug(s) can be identified to treat COVID-19. A detailed analysis of the human host response to SARS CoV 2 with expression profiling by high throughput sequencing has executed with primary human lung epithelium cell lines. Clustered genes annotation and gene network construction are performed with the help of String database. Among four cluster of genes from microarray data, cluster 1 is identified as basal cells with p= 1.37e-05 with 44 genes. Functional enrichment analysis of genes present in gene network has completed using String database, ToppFun online tool and NetworkAnalyst tool. For SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell, play a major role in cell to cell virus particle transmission. Among three types of cell- cell communication, only anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is involved in this virus transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital role in virus spread from one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. In this protein complex structure, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell is used to promote the spread of virus infection into extracellular matrix. So, small molecular blockers of different anchoring junction proteins i.e. ITGA3, ITGA2 can provide efficient protection against this deadly virus disease. Understanding the human host response against this virus is very important to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV 2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anamika Basu","author_inst":"Gurudas College"},{"author_name":"Anasua Sarkar","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Ujjwal Maulik","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Daniel C McGillicuddy","author_inst":"Departments of Emergency Medicine, Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital & University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"},{"author_name":"Dmitriy Burmistrov","author_inst":"Independent Statistical Analyst, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Leon D Sanchez","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center & Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Zhongqi Li","author_inst":"Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Anthony K.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labeled as a pandemic by WHO. Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial for epidemic prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model is developed to study the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of non-linear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R0 was computed. The stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increase while placing interstates individuals and foreigners under quarantine, decreases the chances of exposure and subsequent infection, leading to an increase in the recovery rate. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, help in effectively controlling the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nita H Shah","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"Nisha Sheoran","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"Ekta N Jayswal","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"Dhairya Shukla","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Nehal Shukla","author_inst":"Columbus State University"},{"author_name":"Jagdish Shukla","author_inst":"Department Of Medical Education, Piedmont Columbus Regional"},{"author_name":"Yash Shah","author_inst":"GCS Medical College"},{"author_name":"Anthony K.

We aimed to design a peptide vaccine for COVID-19 particularly for the envelope protein using computational methods to predict epitopes inducing the immune system and can be used later to create a new peptide vaccine that could replace conventional vaccines. A total of available 370 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from NCBI for bioinformatics analysis using Immune Epitope Data Base (IEDB) to predict B and T cells epitopes. Then we docked the best predicted CTL epitopes with HLA alleles. CTL cell epitopes namely interacted with MHC class I alleles and we suggested them to become universal peptides based vaccine against COVID-19. Potentially continuous B cell epitopes were predicted using tools from IEDB. The Allergenicity of predicted epitopes was analyzed by AllerTOP tool and the coverage was determined throughout the worlds. We found these CTL epitopes to be T helper epitopes also. The B cell epitope, SRVKNL and T cell epitope, FLAFVVFLL were suggested to become a universal candidate for peptide-based vaccine against COVID-19.

The lack of approved specific therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19 associated with SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led to the rapid implementation and\/or randomised controlled trials of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) in many countries including the UK. Effective CPT is likely to require high titres of neutralising antibody levels in convalescent donations. Understanding the relationship between functional neutralising antibodies and antibody levels to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins in scalable assays will be crucial for the success of large-scale collection and use of convalescent plasma. We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with reactivity in a range of ELISA assays targeting the spike (S) protein, the main target for human immune response. Methods. Blood samples were collected from 52 individuals with a previous laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 28 days after symptom resolution. These were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies by microneutralisation and pseudotype assays, and for antibodies by four different ELISAs. ROC analysis was used to further identify sensitivity and specificity of selected assays to identify samples containing high neutralising antibody levels suitable for clinical use of convalescent plasma. Results. All samples contained SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, whereas neutralising antibody titres of greater than 1:20 were detected in 43 samples (83% of those tested) and >1:100 in 22 samples (42%). The best correlations were observed with EUROimmun IgG ELISA S\/CO reactivity (Spearman Rho correlation co-efficient 0.88; p<0.001). Based on ROC analysis, EUROimmun would detect 60% of samples with titres of >1:100 with 100% specificity using a reactivity index of 9.1 (13\/22). Discussion. Robust associations between virus neutralising antibody titres and reactivity in several ELISA-based antibody tests demonstrate their possible utility for scaled-up production of convalescent plasma containing potentially therapeutic levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"National Microbiology Services, NHS Blood and Transplant, London UK"},{"author_name":"Matthew Robb","author_inst":"Statistics and Clinical Studies, NHS Blood and Transplant, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Watkins","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant Cambridge, Long Road, Cambridge, CB2 0PT, UK"},{"author_name":"Samreen Ijaz","author_inst":"Virology Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Steven Dicks","author_inst":"Virology Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mokika Patel","author_inst":"High Containment Microbiology, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Pyadai Supasa","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Wanwisa Dejnirattisai","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Abbie Brown","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bailey","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Vipond","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Grayson","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Medicine, University of Oxford, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, ME4 4BF, UK"},{"author_name":"Jai Bolton","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Fyfe","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"High Containment Microbiology, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Craig P Thompson","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Virology Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Gail Miflin","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant, North Bristol Park, Filton, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"David Roberts","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9BQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Ho Ko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Shen Aik","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Michael C.

However, the pathogenetic mechanisms of CRS in COVID-19 are poorly understood. Here we show single cell-level mechanisms for T-cell dysregulation in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thereby demonstrate the mechanisms underlying T-cell hyperactivation and paralysis in severe COVID-19 patients. By in silico sorting CD4+ T-cells from a single cell RNA-seq dataset, we found that CD4+ T-cells were highly activated and showed unique differentiation pathways in the lung of severe COVID-19 patients. Notably, those T-cells in severe COVID-19 patients highly expressed immunoregulatory receptors and CD25, whilst repressing the expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 and interestingly, both the differentiation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and Th17 was inhibited. Meanwhile, highly activated CD4+ T-cells express PD-1 alongside macrophages that express PD-1 ligands in severe patients, suggesting that PD-1-mediated immunoregulation was partially operating. Furthermore, we show that CD25+ hyperactivated T-cells differentiate into multiple helper T-cell lineages, showing multifaceted effector T-cells with Th1 and Th2 characteristics. Lastly, we show that CD4+ T-cells, particularly CD25-expressing hyperactivated T-cells, produce the protease Furin, which facilitates the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, CD4+ T-cells from severe COVID-19 patients are hyperactivated and FOXP3-mediated negative feedback mechanisms are impaired in the lung, while activated CD4+ T-cells continue to promote further viral infection through the production of Furin. Therefore, our study proposes a new model of T-cell hyperactivation and paralysis that drives pulmonary damage, systemic CRS and organ failure in severe COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bahire Kalfaoglu","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Almeida-Santos","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Chanidapa Adele Tye","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yorifumi Satou","author_inst":"Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University"},{"author_name":"Masahiro Ono","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mokika Patel","author_inst":"High Containment Microbiology, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Pyadai Supasa","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Wanwisa Dejnirattisai","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Abbie Brown","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bailey","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Vipond","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Grayson","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Medicine, University of Oxford, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, ME4 4BF, UK"},{"author_name":"Jai Bolton","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Fyfe","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"High Containment Microbiology, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Craig P Thompson","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Virology Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Gail Miflin","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant, North Bristol Park, Filton, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"David Roberts","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9BQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Ho Ko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Shen Aik","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Michael C.

Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and the preprint databases MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies that assessed the association among inflammation level, application of ACEI\/ARB, infection severity and death in patients with COVID-19. Odd risks(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were combined using random-effects or fixed models depending on heterogeneity. Results: Eleven studies were included with a total of 33,483 patients. Our review showed ACEI\/ARB therapy might be associated with the reduced inflammatory factor (interleukin-6) and elevated level of immune cells(CD3, CD8). Meta-analysis showed no significant increase in the risk of COVID-19 infection(OR:0.95, 95%CI:0.89-1.05) in patients receiving ACEI\/ARB therapy, and ACEI\/ARB therapy was associated with a decreased risk of severe COVID-19 (OR:0.75, 95%CI: 0.59-0.96) and mortality (OR:0.52, 95%CI: 0.35-0.79). Subgroup analyses showed that, among the general population, application of ACEI\/ARB therapy was associated with reduced risks of all-cause death(OR:0.31, 95%CI: 0.13-0.75), and the risk of severe COVID-19(OR:0.79, 95%CI: 0.60-1.05) infection and COVID-19 infection(OR:0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.08) were not increased. Among patients with hypertension, the use of an ACEI\/ARB was associated with a lower severity of COVID-19(OR:0.73, 95%CI: 0.51-1.03) and lower mortality(OR:0.57, 95%CI: 0.37-0.87), without evidence of an increased risk of COVID-19 infection(OR:1.00, 95%CI: 0.90-1.12). Conclusion: On the basis of the available evidence, this is the first meta-analysis showed that, in general population, the use of ACEI\/ARB therapy was safe without an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and with a decreasing trend of severe COVID-19 infection and lower mortality. In patients with hypertension, the use of ACEI\/ARB therapy should be encouraged, without increased risk of COVID-19 inflection, and better prognosis (a decreasing trends of severe COVID-19 and reduced all-cause death). Overall, ACEI\/ARB therapy should be continued in patients who are at risk for, or have COVID-19, either in general population or hypertension patients. Our results need to be interpreted with caution considering the potential for residual confounders, and more well-designed studies that control the clinical confounders are necessary to confirm our findings.

Viruses are expected to quickly acquire beneficial mutations upon jumping to a new host species. Advantageous nucleotide substitutions can be identified by their parallel occurrence in multiple independent lineages and are likely to result in changes to protein sequences. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is acquiring mutations more slowly than expected for neutral evolution, suggesting purifying selection is the dominant mode of evolution during the initial phase of the pandemic. However, several parallel mutations arose in multiple independent lineages and may provide a fitness advantage over the ancestral genome. We propose plausible reasons for several of the most frequent mutations. The absence of mutations in other genome regions suggests essential components of SARS-CoV-2 that could be the target of drug development. Overall this study provides genomic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 has adapted and will continue to adapt to humans.\n\nSUMMARYIn this study we sought signals of evolution to identify how the SARS-CoV-2 genome has adapted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As COVID-19 pandemic reached and endured in every corner on earth, countries with moderate to strong healthcare support and expenditure seemed to struggle in containing disease transmission and casualties. COVID-19 affected countries have variability in demographic, socioeconomic and life style health indicators. At this context it is important to find out at what extent these parametric variations are actually modulating disease outcomes. To answer this, we have selected demographic, socioeconomic and health indicators e.g. population density, percentage of urban population, median age, health expenditure per capita, obesity, diabetes prevalence, alcohol intake, tobacco use, case fatality of non communicable diseases (NCDs) as independent variables. Countries were grouped according to these variables and influence on dependent variables e.g. COVID-19 test positive, case fatality and case recovery rates were statistically analyzed. The results suggest that countries with variable median age has significantly different outcome on test positive rate (P<0.01). Both median age (P=0.0397) and health expenditure per capita (P=0.0041) has positive relation with case recovery. Increasing number of test per 100K population showed positive and negative relation with number of positives per 100K population (P=0.0001) and percentage of test positives (P<0.0001) respectively. Alcohol intake per capita in liter (P=0.0046), diabetes prevalence (P=0.0389) and NCDs mortalities (P=0.0477) also showed statistical relation with case fatality rate. Further analysis revealed that countries with high healthcare expenditure along with high median age and increased urban population showed more case fatality but also had better recovery rate. Investment in health sector alone is insufficient in controlling pandemic severity. Intelligent and sustainable healthcare both in urban and rural settings and healthy lifestyle acquired immunity may reduce disease transmission and comorbidity induced fatalities respectively.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asif Ahmed","author_inst":"Khulna University"},{"author_name":"Tasnima Haque","author_inst":"BIHS General Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mahmudur Rahman","author_inst":"Bangladesh University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jianyong Ma","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Chen Chen","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Yuhao Su","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Kui Hong","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Hourong Zhou Jr.","author_inst":"Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Abbie Brown","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bailey","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Vipond","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Grayson","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Medicine, University of Oxford, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, ME4 4BF, UK"},{"author_name":"Jai Bolton","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Fyfe","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"High Containment Microbiology, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Craig P Thompson","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Virology Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Gail Miflin","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant, North Bristol Park, Filton, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"David Roberts","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9BQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Ho Ko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Shen Aik","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Michael C.

We hypothesize that this would project lower cases of infection for the Philippines because of our country's low median age. We introduce the variable U that is multiplied to the incubation rate sigma; when exposed individuals become infected. U is the dot product of the proxy infection probabilities stratified per age group (F) and the population stratified per age group (P) divided by the total population, similar to calculating mathematical expectation. Proxies were taken from two data sets: Hubei, China with a calculated value of U_CHN=0.4447 and Quezon City, Philippines with U_QC=0.5074. When the majority age group, represented by the median age, is far from the age group with the highest number of infections the number of infected individuals decreases and produces a delayed peaking effect. This new method gives a much lower estimate on peak number of infected cases by 65.2% compared with age-stratification alone; and by 75.2% compared with Q-SEIR alone.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua Frankie Rayo","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Diliman"},{"author_name":"Romulo de Castro","author_inst":"Center for Informatics, University of San Agustin, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Jesus Emmanuel Sevilleja","author_inst":"National Center for Mental Health, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Vena Pearl Bongolan","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Diliman"},{"author_name":"Chen Chen","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Yuhao Su","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Kui Hong","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Hourong Zhou Jr.","author_inst":"Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Abbie Brown","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bailey","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Vipond","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Grayson","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Medicine, University of Oxford, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, ME4 4BF, UK"},{"author_name":"Jai Bolton","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Fyfe","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"High Containment Microbiology, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Craig P Thompson","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Virology Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Gail Miflin","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant, North Bristol Park, Filton, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"David Roberts","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9BQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Ho Ko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Shen Aik","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Michael C.

Lymphopenia and cytokine levels are tightly associated with disease severity. However, virus-induced immune dysregulation at cellular and molecular levels remains largely undefined. Here, the leukocytes in the pleural effusion, sputum, and peripheral blood biopsies from severe and mild patients were analyzed at single-cell resolution. Drastic T cell hyperactivation accompanying elevated T cell exhaustion was observed, predominantly in pleural effusion. The mechanistic investigation identified a group of CD14+ monocytes and macrophages highly expressing CD163 and MRC1 in the biopsies from severe patients, suggesting M2 macrophage polarization. These M2-like cells exhibited up-regulated IL10, CCL18, APOE, CSF1 (M-CSF), and CCL2 signaling pathways. Further, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were observed in pleural effusion earlier than in peripheral blood. Together, our results suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune dysregulation by inducing M2 polarization and subsequent T cell exhaustion. This study improves our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National

The logic is that face masks are low cost and might help prevent some transmission. However, from the start, the assumption that face masks are \"low cost\" was questioned. Early on, there were warnings of the opportunity cost of public use of medical masks given shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare providers. This led to recommendations for cloth masks and other face coverings, with little evidence of their ability to prevent transmission. However, there may also be a high cost to these recommendations if people rely on face masks in place of other more effective ways to break transmission, such as staying home. We use SafeGraph smart device location data to show that the representative American in states that have face mask mandates spent 20-30 minutes less time at home, and increase visits to a number of commercial locations, following the mandate. Since the reproductive rate of SAR-COV2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19 is hovering right around one, such substitution behavior could be the difference between controlling the epidemic and a resurgence of cases.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Youpei Yan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jude Bayham","author_inst":"Colorado State

pulmonary disease severity on chest radiographs (CXRs), for longitudinal disease evaluation and clinical risk stratification. Materials and Methods A convolutional Siamese neural network-based algorithm was trained to output a measure of pulmonary disease severity on anterior-posterior CXRs (pulmonary x-ray severity (PXS) score), using weakly-supervised pretraining on ~160,000 images from CheXpert and transfer learning on 314 CXRs from patients with COVID-19. The algorithm was evaluated on internal and external test sets from different hospitals, containing 154 and 113 CXRs respectively. The PXS score was correlated with a radiographic severity score independently assigned by two thoracic radiologists and one in-training radiologist. For 92 internal test set patients with follow-up CXRs, the change in PXS score was compared to radiologist assessments of change. The association between PXS score and subsequent intubation or death was assessed. Results The PXS score correlated with the radiographic pulmonary disease severity score assigned to CXRs in the COVID-19 internal and external test sets ({rho}=0.84 and {rho}=0.78 respectively). The direction of change in PXS score in follow-up CXRs agreed with radiologist assessment ({rho}=0.74). In patients not intubated on the admission CXR, the PXS score predicted subsequent intubation or death within three days of hospital admission (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve=0.80 (95%CI 0.75-0.85)). Conclusion A Siamese neural network-based severity score automatically measures COVID-19 pulmonary disease severity in chest radiographs, which can be scaled and rapidly deployed for clinical triage and workflow optimization.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew D Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nishanth Thumbavanam

Till now, there is no remedy for this epidemic. However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective to control this pandemic. In this paper, we provide an analytical model on the effectiveness of the sustainable lockdown policy that accommodates both isolation and social distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we analyze a noncooperative game environment that provides an incentive for maintaining social distancing. Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is also interpreted with the help of a game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social distancing. Finally, an extensive numerical analysis is provided to study the impact of maintaining a social-distancing measure to prevent the Covid-19 outbreak. Numerical results show that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The numerical results also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home isolation, the individual incentive decreases with an increasing number of individuals.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anupam Kumar Bairagi","author_inst":"Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Rep. of Korea and Computer Science and Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna-9208, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mehedi Masud","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Taif University, Taif, KSA"},{"author_name":"Do Hyeon Kim","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Rep. of Korea"},{"author_name":"Md.
