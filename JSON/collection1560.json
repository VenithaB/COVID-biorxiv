Deregulated complement activation may fuel thrombotic microangiopathy and NET-driven immunothrombosis, thereby exacerbating cytokine-driven hyper-inflammation and multi-organ failure. Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) can elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we have compared the clinical efficacy of the C5-targeting mAb eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe, mainly non-intubated COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in CRP and IL-6 levels, associated with marked lung function improvement and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS. C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile of anti-C3 treatment was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, a greater decline of median LDH levels and more prominent lymphocyte recovery within the first 7 days of treatment. These early clinical results offer important insight into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19. They point to a broader pathogenic involvement of C3-mediated pathways and set the stage for larger prospective trials that will benchmark these complement-targeting agents in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dimitrios C.

This creates their mental issues such as distress, depression and anxiety. Exploring healthcare staff's mental health during the pandemic contributes to improving their persistence in the growing challenges created by COVID-19 and enabling effective management of their mental health. Methods: An online survey of 280 healthcare staff in all the 31 provinces of Iran was conducted during April 5-20, 2020. The survey assessed staff's distress, depression and anxiety in the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Nearly a third of healthcare staff suffered from distress, depression and anxiety. Females and more educated healthcare staff were more likely to experience distress. Compared to personnel who did not have COVID-19, those who were unsure whether they had COVID-19 were more likely to experience distress and depression. The number of COVID-19 cases among the staff's colleagues or friends positively predicted their anxiety. Compared to radio technologists, doctors were less likely to experience distress and anxiety. Technicians and obstetrics experienced less anxiety. Analysis the interaction between weekly working days and age of the staff indicated the chance of experiencing distress and depression varied greatly by working days among younger but not older healthcare staff. Conclusion: The predictors of mental health issues assists healthcare organizations to identify healthcare staff with mental health issues in sever crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research highlight the need to identify more working characteristics as predictors for healthcare staff at different ages.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xingzi Xu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Stephen X.

While the importance of wearing face masks has been acknowledged, there remains a lack of understanding about the role of good fit in rendering protective equipment useful. In addition, supply chain constraints have caused some organizations to abandon traditional quantitative or qualitative fit testing, and instead, have implemented subjective fit checking. Our study seeks to quantitatively evaluate the level of fit offered by various types of masks, and most importantly, assess the accuracy of implementing fit checks by comparing fit check results to quantitative fit testing results. Methods: Seven participants first evaluated N95 and KN95 masks by performing a fit check. Participants then underwent quantitative fit testing wearing five N95 masks, a KN95 mask, a surgical mask, and fabric masks. Results: N95 masks offered higher degrees of protection than the other categories of masks tested; however, it should be noted that most N95 masks failed to fit the participants adequately. Fit check responses had poor correlation with quantitative fit scores. All non-N95 masks achieved low fit scores. Conclusion: Fit is critical to the level of protection offered by masks. For an N95 mask to provide the promised protection, it must fit the participant. Performing a fit check was an unreliable way of determining fit.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eugenia O'Kelly","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Anmol Arora","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Sophia Pirog","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"James Ward","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"P John Clarkson","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Khaled Nawaser","author_inst":"Arvandan Non-profit Higher Education Institute"},{"author_name":"Annalisa Ruggeri","author_inst":"Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Marina Sironi","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Peter Radermacher","author_inst":"Sektion Anasthesiologische Pathophysiologie und Verfahrensentwicklung (APV), University Hospital of Ulm"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis Skendros","author_inst":"Democritus University of Thrace"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"Democritus University of Thrace"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Manfra","author_inst":"AORN San Giuseppe Moscati"},{"author_name":"Simona Iacobelli","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Markus Huber-Lang","author_inst":"Institute for Clinical and Experimental Trauma-Immunology, University Hospital of Ulm"},{"author_name":"Bo Nilsson","author_inst":"Uppsala University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Despina Yancopoulou","author_inst":"Amyndas Pharmaceuticals"},{"author_name":"E.

A pre-requisite to an effective control strategy is that predictions need to be accompanied by estimates of their precision, to guard against over-reaction to potentially spurious features of 'best guess' predictions. In the UK, important emerging risk-factors such as social deprivation or ethnicity vary over small distances, hence risk needs to be modelled at fine spatial resolution to avoid aggregation bias. We demonstrate that existing geospatial statistical methods originally developed for global health applications are well-suited to this task and can be used in an anonymised databank environment, thus preserving the privacy of the individuals who contribute their data.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Fry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Joe Hollinghurst","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Helen R Stagg","author_inst":"Edinburgh University"},{"author_name":"Daniel A Thompson","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Claudio Fronterre","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Chris Orton","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"David V Ford","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Aziz Sheikh","author_inst":"Edinburgh University"},{"author_name":"Peter J Diggle","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"Democritus University of Thrace"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Manfra","author_inst":"AORN San Giuseppe Moscati"},{"author_name":"Simona Iacobelli","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Markus Huber-Lang","author_inst":"Institute for Clinical and Experimental Trauma-Immunology, University Hospital of Ulm"},{"author_name":"Bo Nilsson","author_inst":"Uppsala University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Despina Yancopoulou","author_inst":"Amyndas Pharmaceuticals"},{"author_name":"E.

However, air travel would continue to be the dominant mode of intercontinental transportation for humans. In this study, we perform a comprehensive computational analysis of typical intercontinental aircraft ventilation systems to determine the seat where environmental factors are most conducive to human comfort with regards to air quality, protection from orally or nasally released pollutants such as CO2 and coronavirus, and thermal comfort levels. Air velocity, temperature, and air pollutant concentration emitted from the nose\/mouth of fellow travelers are considered for both Boeing and Airbus planes. In each plane, first class, business class, and economy class sections were analyzed. We present conclusions as to which is the optimum seat in each section of each plane and provide the data of the environmental conditions to support our inferences. The findings may be used by the general public to decide which seat to occupy for their next intercontinental flight.

Materials and Methods A retrospective cohort study in a UK tertiary level oncology centre between 1st March and 23 June 2020, including patients with HNC who were either newly diagnosed, had developed new recurrent\/metastatic disease, or were already scheduled to receive treatment during that period. Results 200 patients were evaluated. Median age was 64 years, 65.5% had multiple co-morbidities, 77.5% were current or ex-smokers and 59.5% lived in areas of deprivation. 99 patients were treated with 6 weeks of radical (chemo) radiotherapy. Systemic anti-cancer treatment was delivered to 40 patients. 2 (1.0%) patients with HNC had confirmed COVID-19 infection; 1 patient prior to primary radical RT - no delay to treatment was required and RT was completed as planned, 1 patient acquired COVID-19 after primary surgery but recovered well and started adjuvant RT 9.7 weeks after surgery. The proportion of patients receiving supportive care only (19.5%) was in keeping with that pre-COVID-19.

Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of various biomedical features and appropriate technical approaches to accurately detecting COVID-19 patients. In this study, we recruited 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients in non-severe (NS) and 148 in severe (S) clinical type, 198 non-infected healthy (H) participants and 129 non-COVID viral pneumonia (V) patients. The participants' clinical information (23 features), lab testing results (10 features), and thoracic CT scans upon admission were acquired as three input feature modalities. To enable late fusion of multimodality data, we developed a deep learning model to extract a 10-feature high-level representation of the CT scans. Exploratory analyses showed substantial differences of all features among the four classes. Three machine learning models (k-nearest neighbor kNN, random forest RF, and support vector machine SVM) were developed based on the 43 features combined from all three modalities to differentiate four classes (NS, S, V, and H) at once. All three models had high accuracy to differentiate the overall four classes (95.4%-97.7%) and each individual class (90.6%-99.9%). Multimodal features provided substantial performance gain from using any single feature modality. Compared to existing binary classification benchmarks often focusing on single feature modality, this study provided a novel and effective breakthrough for clinical applications. Findings and the analytical workflow can be used as clinical decision support for current COVID-19 and other clinical applications with high-dimensional multimodal biomedical features.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ming Xu","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Disease Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Liu Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Gao","author_inst":"Institute of Suzhou Biobank, Suzhou Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Suzhou 215004, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanfang Chen","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Tingting Yu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medical Science Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Xenotransplantation, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Li","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Kunshan Hospital of Jiangsu University, Kunshan 215300, China"},{"author_name":"Kai Sun","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, the First Hospital with Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Forrest S Bao","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, USA"},{"author_name":"Lida Safarnejad","author_inst":"Department of Software and Information Systems, College of Computing and Informatics, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223"},{"author_name":"Jing Wen","author_inst":"Ultrasound Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China"},{"author_name":"Chao Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, School of Medicine and Life Science, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210046, China"},{"author_name":"Tianyang Chen","author_inst":"Center for Applied Geographic Information Science, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte 28262, USA"},{"author_name":"Lei Han","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Hengdong Zhang","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Gao","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengmin Yu","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowen Liu","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Tianyu Yan","author_inst":"Department of Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA"},{"author_name":"Hebi Li","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, USA"},{"author_name":"Patrick Robinson","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Health and Human Services, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223, USA"},{"author_name":"Baoli Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Liu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Zengli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China"},{"author_name":"Yaorong Ge","author_inst":"Department of Software and Information Systems, College of Computing and Informatics, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223, USA"},{"author_name":"Shi Chen","author_inst":"UNC Charlotte"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.20175950","rel_title":"Decline of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, IgM and IgA in convalescent COVID-19 patients within 100 days after hospital discharge","rel_date":"2020-08-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.20175950","rel_abs":"Monitoring the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies such as IgG, M and A in COVID-19 patient is an alternative method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and an simple way to monitor immune responses in convalescent patients and after vaccination.

Almost all patient who had severe or moderate COVID-19 symptoms and a high-level of IgG during the hospitalization showed a significant reduction at revisit. The remaining patients who had a low-level IgG during hospitalization stayed low at revisit. As expected, IgM levels in almost all convalescent patients reduced significantly or stayed low at revisit. The RBD-specific IgA levels were also reduced significantly at revisit. We also attempted to estimate decline rates of virus-specific antibodies using a previously established exponential decay model of antibody kinetics after infection. The predicted days when convalescent patients' RBD-specific IgG reaches to an undetectable level are approximately 273 days after hospital discharge, while the predicted decay times are 150 days and 108 days for IgM and IgA, respectively.

Objective: We characterized and compared 11 different lateral flow assays for their performance in diagnostic or epidemiological settings. Design, Setting, Participants: We used two cohorts to determine the speci- ficity: (i) up to 350 blood donor samples from past influenza seasons and (ii) up to 110 samples which tested PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Switzerland. The sensitivity was determined using up to 370 samples which tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the same time and is representative for age distribution and severity. Main Outcome: We found a single test usable for epidemiological studies in the current low-prevalence setting, all other tests showed lacking sensitivity or specificity for a usage in either epidemiological or diagnostic setting. However, orthogonal testing by combining two tests without common cross-reactivities makes testing in a low-prevalence setting feasible. Results: Nine out of the eleven tests showed specificities below 99%, only five of eleven tests showed sensitivities comparable to established ELISAs, and only one ful- filled both criteria. Contrary to previous results from lab assays, five tests measured an IgM response in >80% of the samples. We found no common cross-reactivities, which allows orthogonal testing schemes for five tests of sufficient sensitivities. Conclusions and Relevance: This study emphasizes the need for large and diverse negative cohorts when determining specificities, and for diverse and repre- sentative positive samples when determining sensitivities of lateral flow assays for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Failure to adhere to statistically relevant sample sizes or cohorts exclusively made up of hospitalised patients fails to accurately capture the performance of these assays in epidemiological settings. Our results allow a rational choice between tests for different use cases.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabian Rudolf","author_inst":"eth zurich"},{"author_name":"Hans-Michael Kaltenbach","author_inst":"eth Zurich"},{"author_name":"Janina Linnik","author_inst":"eth Zurich"},{"author_name":"Marie-Therese Ruf","author_inst":"Swiss TPH and Uni Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"IRB Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Nickel","author_inst":"Swiss TPH and Uni Basel, Switerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Gygax","author_inst":"FHNW Muttenz, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Miodrag Savic","author_inst":"Uni Basel and University Hospital Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Xueying Zheng","author_inst":"Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Tengchuan Jin","author_inst":"Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Chao Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, School of Medicine and Life Science, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210046, China"},{"author_name":"Tianyang Chen","author_inst":"Center for Applied Geographic Information Science, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte 28262, USA"},{"author_name":"Lei Han","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Hengdong Zhang","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Gao","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengmin Yu","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowen Liu","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Tianyu Yan","author_inst":"Department of Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA"},{"author_name":"Hebi Li","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, USA"},{"author_name":"Patrick Robinson","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Health and Human Services, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223, USA"},{"author_name":"Baoli Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Liu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Zengli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China"},{"author_name":"Yaorong Ge","author_inst":"Department of Software and Information Systems, College of Computing and Informatics, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223, USA"},{"author_name":"Shi Chen","author_inst":"UNC Charlotte"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.18.20177071","rel_title":"Use, reuse or discard: quantitatively defined variance in N95 respirator integrity following vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-08-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.18.20177071","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 has stretched the ability of many institutions to supply needed personal protective equipment, especially N95 respirators. N95 decontamination and reuse programs provide one potential solution to this problem. Unfortunately, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of decontamination on the integrity of various N95 models using a quantitative fit test (QTFT) approach is lacking. Aims: 1) To investigate the effects of up to eight rounds of vaporized H2O2 (VHP) decontamination on the integrity of N95 respirators currently in use in a hospital setting. 2) To examine if N95 respirators worn by one user can adapt to the face shape of a second user with no compromise of integrity following VHP decontamination. Methods: The PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester Model 8038 was used to quantitatively define the integrity, measured by fit, of N95 respirators following decontamination with VHP. Findings: There was an observable downward trend in the integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators throughout eight cycles of decontamination with VHP. The integrity of 3M 1870 N95 respirators was significantly reduced after the respirator was worn, decontaminated with VHP, and then quantitatively fit tested on a second user. Furthermore, we uncovered inconsistencies between qualitative fit test and QTFT results that may have strong implications on the fit testing method used by institutions. Conclusions: Our data revealed variability in the integrity of different N95 models after VHP decontamination and exposed potential limitations of N95 decontamination and reuse programs.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carly Levine","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Courtney Grady","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Block","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Harry Hurley","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Russo","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Blas Peixoto","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Alexis Frees","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Ruiz","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"David Alland","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Tengchuan Jin","author_inst":"Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Chao Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, School of Medicine and Life Science, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210046, China"},{"author_name":"Tianyang Chen","author_inst":"Center for Applied Geographic Information Science, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte 28262, USA"},{"author_name":"Lei Han","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Hengdong Zhang","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Gao","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengmin Yu","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowen Liu","author_inst":"Public Health Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Tianyu Yan","author_inst":"Department of Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA"},{"author_name":"Hebi Li","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, USA"},{"author_name":"Patrick Robinson","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Health and Human Services, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223, USA"},{"author_name":"Baoli Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Liu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Zengli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China"},{"author_name":"Yaorong Ge","author_inst":"Department of Software and Information Systems, College of Computing and Informatics, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223, USA"},{"author_name":"Shi Chen","author_inst":"UNC Charlotte"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.18.20176743","rel_title":"Breastmilk; a source of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies","rel_date":"2020-08-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.18.20176743","rel_abs":"Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many put their hopes in the rapid development of effective immunizations. For now patient isolation, physical distancing and good hygiene are the sole measures for prevention. Processed breast milk with antibodies against SaRS-CoV-2 may serve as additional protection. We aimed to determine the presence and neutralization capacity of antibodies against SaRS-CoV-2 in breastmilk of mothers who have recovered from COVID-19. Methods: This prospective case control study included lactating mothers, recovered from (suspected) COVID-19 and healthy controls. Serum and breastmilk was collected. To assess the presence of antibodies in breastmilk and serum, we used multiple complementary assays, namely ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein for IgG and bridging ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and N protein for total Ig. To assess the effect of pasteurization breastmilk was exposed to Holder Pasteurization and High Pressure Pasteurization. Results: Breastmilk contained antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using any of the assays in 24 out of 29 (83%) proven cases, in six out of nine (67%) suspected cases and in none of the 13 controls. In vitro neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate virus strain was successful in a subset of serum (13%) and milk samples (26%). Although after pasteurization of the milk SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected with both methods of pasteurization, virus neutralizing capacity of those antibodies was only retained with the HPP approach. Conclusion: Breastmilk of mothers who recovered from COVID-19 contains significant amounts of IgA against SARS-CoV-2, both before and after pasteurization.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Britt J van Keulen","author_inst":"Emma Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michelle Romijn","author_inst":"Emma Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Albert Bondt","author_inst":"University of Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Dingess","author_inst":"University of Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Eva Kontopodi","author_inst":"Wageningen University and Research"},{"author_name":"Karlijn van der Straten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Maurits A den Boer","author_inst":"University of Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Berend J Bosch","author_inst":"University of Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Philip J.M.

To assess whether this impaired our ability to detect and control early introductions of the virus into the UK, we PCR-tested archival specimens collected on admission to a large UK teaching hospital who retrospectively were identified as having a clinical presentation compatible with COVID-19. In addition, we screened available archival specimens submitted for respiratory virus diagnosis, and dating back to early January 2020, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our data provides evidence for widespread community circulation of SARS-CoV2 in early February 2020 and into March that was undetected at the time due to restrictive case definitions informing testing policy. Genome sequence data showed that many of these early cases were infected with a distinct lineage of the virus. Sequences obtained from the first officially recorded case in Nottinghamshire - a traveller returning from Daegu, South Korea - also clustered with these early UK sequences suggesting acquisition of the virus occurred in the UK and not Daegu. Analysis of a larger sample of sequences obtained in the Nottinghamshire area revealed multiple viral introductions, mainly in late February and through March. These data highlight the importance of timely and extensive community testing to prevent future widespread transmission of the virus.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph G Chappell","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Theocharis Tsoleridis","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Gemma Clark","author_inst":"Nottingham University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Louise Berry","author_inst":"Nottingham University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nadine Holmes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Christopher Moore","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Matthew Carlile","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Fei Sang","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Johnny Debebe","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Victoria Wright","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"William Irving","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Brian J Thomson","author_inst":"Nottingham University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Timothy C.J.

However, mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated thrombo-coagulopathy, and its impact on patient morbidity and mortality, are still poorly understood. Methods: We performed a comprehensive analysis of coagulation and thromboinflammatory factors in plasma from COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity. Furthermore, we assessed the functional impact of these factors on clot formation and clot lysis. Results: Across all COVID-19 disease severities (mild, moderate and severe) we observed a significant increase (6-fold) in the concentration of ultra-large von Willebrand factor (UL-VWF) multimers compared to healthy controls. This is likely the result of an interleukin (IL)-6 driven imbalance of VWF and the regulatory protease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13). Upregulation of this key pro-coagulant pathway may also be influenced by the observed increase (~6-fold) in plasma -defensins, a consequence of increased numbers of neutrophils and neutrophil activation. Markers of endothelial, platelet and leukocyte activation were accompanied by increased plasma concentrations of Factor XIII (FXIII) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1. In patients with high FXIII we observed alteration of the fibrin network structure in in vitro assays of clot formation, which coupled with increased PAI-1, prolonged the time to clot lysis by the t-PA\/plasmin fibrinolytic pathway by 52% across all COVID-19 patients (n=23). Conclusions: We show that an imbalance in the VWF\/ADAMTS13 axis causing increased VWF reactivity may contribute to the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients. Through immune and inflammatory responses, COVID-19 also alters the balance of factors involved in fibrin generation and fibrinolysis which accounts for the persistent fibrin deposition previously observed in post-mortem lung tissue.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kieron South","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Lucy Roberts","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Lucy Victoria Morris","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Mann","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Madhvi Menon","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Sean Knight","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Joanne E Konkel","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ustianowsk","author_inst":"Regional Infectious Diseases Unit, North Manchester General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nawar D Bakerly","author_inst":"Respiratory Department, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul M Dark","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Angela Simpson","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Timothy Felton","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Alexander Horsley","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"- CIRCO","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Tracy Hussell","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"John R.

Pregnant and puerperal women comprise the population most vulnerable to impacts on mental health. Objective: To synthesize the scientific evidence on the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnant and puerperal women. Methods: systematic review focused on answering the question what is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnan and puerperal women?. In order to perform the search of the studies, we used combinations among the keywords: pregnan*, puerper*, prenatal, perinatal, mental health, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. In total, we identified 150 studies from the databases and 14 studies were selected from preprints. We identified another four studies through manual search, totaling 18 studies to compose the final sample of this review. Results: Anxiety and depression were the main outcomes found, being shown in 15 and 11 studies, respectively. Other outcomes found in more than one study were: concerns related to several factors, loneliness, stress and fear. Conclusion: From this review, we can infer that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of pregnant and puerperal women, with depression and anxiety being the most frequent changes. The social detachment, the media pressure, the fear of contracting the infection, the economic scenario and the rupture of family rituals are shown as intensifying factors of psychological distress, thus causing changes in the mental health of these women.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leticia Genova Vieira","author_inst":"Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Emerson Lucas SIlva Camargo","author_inst":"Universidade de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto"},{"author_name":"Guilherme Schneider","author_inst":"Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gabrielly Pereira Rocatti da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto"},{"author_name":"Micaella Thomazini Sr.","author_inst":"Universidade de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto"},{"author_name":"Matheus Arantes Possani","author_inst":"Universidade de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto"},{"author_name":"Matheus Roz\u00e1rio Matioli","author_inst":"Universidade de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto"},{"author_name":"Aline Raquel de Sousa Ibiapina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Piau\u00ed"},{"author_name":"Nawar D Bakerly","author_inst":"Respiratory Department, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul M Dark","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Angela Simpson","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Timothy Felton","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Alexander Horsley","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"- CIRCO","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Tracy Hussell","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"John R.

Materials: We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning-based approach to predict the need for mechanical ventilation as early as at the time of initial radiographic evaluation. We exploited the well-established DenseNet121 deep learning architecture for this purpose on 663 X-ray images derived from 528 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts blindly and independently evaluated the same X-ray images for purpose of validation. Results: We found that our deep learning model predicted the need for ventilation with a high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (90.06%, 86.34% and 84.38%, respectively). This prediction was done approximately three days ahead of the actual intubation event. Our model also outperformed two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts who evaluated the same X-ray images and provided an incremental accuracy of 7.24-13.25%. Conclusion: Our deep learning model accurately predicted the need for mechanical ventilation early during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. Until effective preventive or treatment measures become widely available for COVID-19 patients, prognostic stratification as provided by our model is likely to be highly valuable.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anoop R Kulkarni","author_inst":"Innotomy Consulting, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Ambarish M Athavale","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Ashima Sahni","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep, and Allergy, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Shashvat Sukhal","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Abhimanyu Sahni","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Matthew Itteera","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Sara Zhukovsky","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA"},{"author_name":"Jane Vernik","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Mohan Abraham","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Amit Joshi","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Amatur Amarah","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Juan Ruiz","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Peter Hart","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Hemant Kulkarni","author_inst":"M&H Research, LLC"},{"author_name":"Tracy Hussell","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"John R.

This broad platform technology can be used to assess the diversity of the cellular adaptive immune system and track disease-associated TCRs and BCRs during the course of infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is spreading rapidly throughout the world, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Researchers, governments, and biotechnology companies are mobilizing to develop and distribute diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives to try to curb this global pandemic. Methods: In collaboration with our partners LabCorp\/Covance, Adaptive Biotechnologies has opened the ImmuneRACE study to prospectively collect samples from individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, or who have been exposed to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2. Discussion: We believe that the information contained within the genetics of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can improve our understanding of the immunobiology of this devasting virus and may inform efforts to improve current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. To facilitate scientific and clinical advancement in the fight against COVID-19, the TCR sequence data resulting from the primary aims of this study will be made publicly available to scientists and researchers across the globe, an effort made possible through a collaboration with Microsoft.

For example, in the US, estimate the proportion P(t) = N\/330 where N is the US total who have ever been infected (in millions)at time t (months, t =0 being March 20). This is important for decisions on social restrictions, and allocation of medical resources, etc. However, the demand for extensive testing has not produced good estimates. In the US, the CDC has used the blood supply to sample for anti-bodies. Anti-bodies do not tell the whole picture, according to the Karolinska Instituet , many post infection cases show T-cell immunity, but no anti-bodies. We introduce a method based on a difference-differential equation (dde) for P(t). We emphasize that this is just for the present, with no prediction on how the pandemic will evolve. The dde uses only x=x(s), which is the number\/million testing positive, and y=y(s), the number\/million who have been tested for all time 0 < s < t (months), with no assumptions on the dynamics of the pandemic. However, we need two parameters. First, R , the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infected cases. Second, T , the period of active infection when the virus can be detected. Both are random variables with distribution which can be estimated. For fixed R, we prove uniform bounds (1+ R) x\/(y +1) < P(t) < (1+ R) x(t) , are best possible, with range depending on T . One advantage of our theory is being able to estimate P for many regions and countries where x and y is the only information available.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David H Hamilton","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Thomas J.

To evaluate association of state-level sociodemographics with incident cases and deaths we performed an ecological study. Methods: Publicly available data sources were used. Absolute number of covid-19 cases and deaths were obtained and cases and deaths\/million in each state calculated from February to July 2020. To assess association of state level disease burden with sociodemographic variables (urbanization, human development, healthcare availability, healthcare access and quality etc.) we determined Pearson correlation and logarithmic trends. Results: Covid-19 in India has led to more than 2,000,000 cases and 45,000 deaths by end July 2020. There is large variation in state-level cases\/million ranging from 7247 (Delhi), 3728 (Goa) and 3427 (Maharashtra) to less than 300\/million in a few. Deaths\/million range from 212 (Delhi), 122 (Maharashtra) and 51 (Tamilnadu) to 2 in north-eastern states. Most of the high burden states (except Delhi) are reporting increasing burden and deaths with the largest increase in July 2020. There is a significant positive correlation of urbanization with covid-19 cases (r= 0.65, R squared= 0.35) and deaths (r= 0.60, R squared= 0.28) and weaker correlation with other sociodemographic variables. From March to July 2020, stable R squared value for urbanization is observed with cases (0.37 to 0.39) while it is increasing for deaths (0.10 to 0.28). Conclusions: Covid-19 epidemic is escalating in India and cases as well as deaths are significantly greater in more urbanized states. Prevention, control and treatment should focus on urban health systems.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajeev Gupta","author_inst":"Eternal Heart Care Centre & Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajinder K Dhamija","author_inst":"Lady Hardinge Medical College, SSKM Hospital, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Kiran Gaur","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Mathematics and Computer Science, SKN Agriculture College, SKN Agriculture University, Jobner, Jaipur, India"},{"author_name":"Raghubir S Khedar","author_inst":"Eternal Heart Care Centre & Research Institute, Jaipur, India"},{"author_name":"Ruth Taniguchi","author_inst":"Adaptive Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Mark Klinger","author_inst":"Adaptive Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Lance Baldo","author_inst":"Adaptive Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Harlan Robins","author_inst":"Adaptive Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Mohan Abraham","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Amit Joshi","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Amatur Amarah","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Juan Ruiz","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Peter Hart","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Hemant Kulkarni","author_inst":"M&H Research, LLC"},{"author_name":"Tracy Hussell","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"John R.

The objective of the study was to report the clinical manifestation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients. Methods: A online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted for initial recruitment of participants with subsequent telephone interview by the three trained physicians in 237 adults with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh. The study period was between 27 April to 26th May, 2020. Consent was ensured before commencing the interview. Collected data were entered in a predesigned case report form and subsequently analyzed by SPSS 20. Results: The mean age at presentation was 41.59 (13.73 SD) years and most of the cases were male (73%). A total of 90.29% of patients reside in urban areas. Among the positive cases, 13.1% (n=31) were asymptomatic. Asymptomatic cases were significantly more common in households with 2 to 4 members (p=.008). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients shared similar ages of presentation (p=0.23), gender differences (p=0.30), and comorbidities (p=0.11). Only 5.3% of patients received ICU care during their treatment. The most frequent presentation was fever (88.3%), followed by cough (69.9%), chest pain (34.5%), body ache (31.1%), and sore throat (30.1%). Thirty-nine percent (n=92) of the patients had comorbidities, with diabetes and hypertension being the most frequently observed. Conclusion: There has been an upsurge in COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh. Patients were mostly middle-aged and male. Typical presentations were fever and cough. Maintenance of social distancing and increased testing are required to meet the current public health challenge.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Jahid Hasan","author_inst":"Pi Research Consultancy Center"},{"author_name":"Sayeda Mukta Chowdhury","author_inst":"Pi Research Consultancy Center"},{"author_name":"Md Abdullah Saeed Khan","author_inst":"Pi Research Consultancy Center"},{"author_name":"Monjur Rahaman","author_inst":"Pi Research Consultancy Center"},{"author_name":"Jannatul Fardous","author_inst":"Pi Research Consultancy Center"},{"author_name":"Tanjir Adit","author_inst":"Keranigonj Health Complex"},{"author_name":"Mustafizur Rahman","author_inst":"Kuet Moitri Hospital, Dhaka"},{"author_name":"Md.

Methods In an outbreak study (cohort 1), we performed FMS and NPS for 21 consecutive days after diagnosis on six healthcare workers who were screened positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a second hospitalised cohort (cohort 2), we performed FMS on 47 patients within 24 hours of a positive diagnosis. COVID-19 severity was graded according to WHO recommendations. Findings In cohort 1, SARS-COV-2 was detected by FMS in 10\/40 (25%) samples (4\/6 individuals), with no correlation between NPS and FMS RNA signals. All samples were negative by day 14 post diagnosis. Sustained FMS positivity with higher viral RNA signals showed a trend towards disease severity. In cohort 2, 19\/47 (40%) individuals exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA extending over five orders of magnitude. FMS positive participants were older (positive: median age [IQR] 71 [61-84] vs negative: 61 [45-73], p=0.04) with more comorbidities (positive: 2 [1-3] vs negative: 1 [0-2], p<0.001) and have active cough (positive: 68% vs negative: 24%, p=0.003) and breathlessness (positive: 74% vs negative: 32%, p=0.005) during sampling, compared to FMS negative patients. Of five patients who were FMS positive and asymptomatic at time of sampling, two died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia within one month of follow up. Interpretation FMS detects exhaled SARS-COV-2, with stronger signals in those who develop severe disease.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caroline Williams","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Daniel Pan","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Decker","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Anika Wisniewska","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Shirley Sze","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Eve Fletcher","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Richard Haigh","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Mohamad Abdulwhhab","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Paul Bird","author_inst":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Christopher Holmes","author_inst":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Alaa Al-Taie","author_inst":"Al-Nahrain University"},{"author_name":"Baber Saleem","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Jingzhe Pan","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Natalie Garton","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Manish Pareek","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Michael Barer","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Craig J Smith","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Stuart M Allan","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Michelle M.

Congruently, SARS-CoV-2 virus, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, has been demonstrated to infect the gastrointestinal tissues, and be shed in feces. In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater, sludge, surface water, ground water, and soil samples of municipal and hospital wastewater systems and related environment in Wuhan during the COVID-19 middle and low risk periods, and the viral RNA copies quantified using RT-qPCR. From the findings of this study, during the middle risk period, one influent sample and three secondary treatment effluents collected from Waste Water Treatment Plant 2 (WWTP2), as well as two influent samples from wastewater system of Hospital 2 were SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive. One sludge sample collected from Hospital 4; which was obtained during low risk period, was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These study findings demonstrate the significance of WBE in continuous surveilling and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level, even when the COVID19 prevalence is low. Therefore, the application of WBE is principally useful in tracking the level of infections in communities and the risk assessment of the secondary environment.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lu Zhao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Evans Atoni","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Yao Du","author_inst":"School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Huaiyu Zhang","author_inst":"Central and Southern China Municipal Design & Research Institute Co., Ltd., Wuhan China"},{"author_name":"Oscar Donde","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Science, Egerton University, P.

This study presents a computational model of virus propagation within the respiratory tract network. The model includes the generation network branch structure of the respiratory tract, biophysical and infectivity properties of the virus, as well as air flow models that aid the circulation of the virus particles. The model can also consider the impact of the immune response aim to inhibit virus replication and spread. The model was applied to the SARS-CoV-2 virus by integrating data on its life-cycle, as well as density of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2) expressing cells along the respiratory tract network. Using physiological data associated with the respiratory rate and virus load that is inhaled, the model can improve our understanding of the concentration and spatiotemporal dynamics of virus.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dixon Vimalajeewa","author_inst":"Waterford Institute ofTechnology"},{"author_name":"Sasitharan Balasubramaniam","author_inst":"Waterford Institute of technology"},{"author_name":"Donagh P Berry","author_inst":"Teagasc, Animal & Grassland Research and Innovation"},{"author_name":"Gerald Barry","author_inst":"University Collage Dublin"},{"author_name":"Oscar Donde","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Science, Egerton University, P.

However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in patients, including headache, seizures, stroke, and fatigue. The cause of these complications is not yet known, and whether they are due to a direct infection of neural cells, such as neurons and astrocytes, or through indirect effects on supportive brain cells, is unknown. Here, we use brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We examine expression of the key viral receptor ACE2 in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealing that only a subset of choroid plexus cells but not neurons or neural progenitors express this entry factor. We then challenge organoids with both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate high viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but not stromal cells, and little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells of the choroid plexus are an apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing subset of epithelial barrier cells. Finally, we show that infection with live SARS-CoV-2 leads to barrier breakdown of the choroid plexus. These findings suggest that neurological complications may result from effects on the choroid plexus, an important barrier that normally prevents entry of immune cells and cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Pellegrini","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Anna Albecka","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Donna L Mallery","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Max J Kellner","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"David Paul","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Carter","author_inst":"MRC Lab of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Leo C James","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Madeline A Lancaster","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Zhu Shu","author_inst":"School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiming Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Lei Tong","author_inst":"School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Han Xia","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Jingzhe Pan","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Natalie Garton","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Manish Pareek","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Michael Barer","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Craig J Smith","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Stuart M Allan","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Michelle M.

Furthermore, it is expected that COVID-19 patients recovered from severe disease may experience long-term metabolic disorders. Thereby understanding the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host metabolism can facilitate efforts for effective treatment option. We have previously shown that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells undergo a shift towards glycolysis and that 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we show that also pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is remarkably deregulated. Since PPP supplies ribonucleotides for SARS-CoV-2 replication, this could represent an attractive target for an intervention. On that account, we employed the transketolase inhibitor benfooxythiamine and showed dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in non-toxic concentrations. Importantly, the antiviral efficacy of benfooxythiamine was further increased in combination with 2DG.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology"},{"author_name":"Rui Costa","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Marco Bechtel","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Goethe Universtiy Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Martin Michaelis","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinatl Jr.","author_inst":"Klinikum der Goethe-Universitaet"},{"author_name":"Leo C James","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Madeline A Lancaster","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Zhu Shu","author_inst":"School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiming Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Lei Tong","author_inst":"School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Han Xia","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Jingzhe Pan","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Natalie Garton","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Manish Pareek","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Michael Barer","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Craig J Smith","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Stuart M Allan","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Michelle M.

Thus the analysis of genomic mutations of these circulatory strains may give an insight into the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and evolution favoring the development of effective treatment and containment strategies. With this target, the current study traced the evolutionary route and mutational frequency of 198 Bangladesh originated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform over a period of 13 weeks as of 14 July 2020. The analyses were performed using MEGA 7, Swiss Model Repository, Virus Pathogen Resource and Jalview visualization. Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains in the country belong to B and\/or L type among cluster A to Z and strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in Nonspecific protein 2 (NSP2), NSP3, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Helicase, Spike, ORF3a, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations(UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, E (Envelope), NSP7a, ORF 6, and ORF 7b suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed an association with sex and age of the COVID-19 positive cases. So, identification of these mutational accumulation patterns may greatly facilitate drug\/ vaccine development deciphering the age and the sex dependent differential susceptibility to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Otun Saha","author_inst":"Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Rokaiya Nurani Shatadru","author_inst":"University of Dhaka"},{"author_name":"Nadira Naznin Rakhi","author_inst":"Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Israt Islam","author_inst":"University of Dhaka"},{"author_name":"Md.

Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the {beta}-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich information on the molecular basis of the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future novel {beta}-CoVs.\n\nSignificanceUnraveling the molecular basis for host cell receptor usage among {beta}-CoVs is crucial to our understanding of cross-species transmission, adaptation and for molecular-guided epidemiological monitoring of potential outbreaks. In the present study, we survey the sequence conservation patterns of the {beta}-CoV spike protein family to identify the evolutionary constraints shaping the functional specificity of the protein across the {beta}-CoV lineage. We show that the unsupervised analysis of statistical patterns in a MSA of the spike protein family can help tracing the amino acid space encoding the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to their cognate host cell receptors. We argue that the results obtained in this work can provide a framework for monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 specificity to the hACE2 receptor, as the virus continues spreading in the human population and differential virulence starts to arise.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Camila Pontes","author_inst":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), 08034 Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Victoria Isabel Ruiz-Serra","author_inst":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), 08034 Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Rosalba Lepore","author_inst":"BSC-CNS Barcelona Supercomputing Center"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Valencia","author_inst":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), 08034 Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Md.
