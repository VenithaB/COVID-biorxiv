The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matteo Chinazzi","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T.

Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a \"public-health emergency of international concern\" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach.\n\nMethodSeveral techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.\n\nResultsExtensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.\n\nConclusionT cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety, immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miyssa I.

As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China. Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days. Conclusions: The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further reduce the Rc to below one in order to end the current epidemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chong You","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yuhao Deng","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Hu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Jiarui Sun","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qiushi Lin","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhou","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Heng Pang","author_inst":"University of Nottingham Ningbo China"},{"author_name":"Yuan Zhang","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Family Planning"},{"author_name":"Zhengchao Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Xiong","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"M.

This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. Hopefully, this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive treatment against this lethal virus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bishajit Sarkar","author_inst":"Jahangirnagar University"},{"author_name":"Md.

The entry of SARS-CoV into host cells mainly depends on the cell receptor (ACE2) recognition and spike protein cleavage-induced cell membrane fusion3,4. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 with a similar affinity, whereas its spike protein cleavage remains unclear5,6. Here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enhances the cleavage efficiency, and besides pulmonary alveoli, intestinal and esophagus epithelium were also the target tissues of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found a SPRR insertion in the S1\/S2 protease cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence aligment and furin score calculation. Additionally, the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for protease recognition by the homology modeling and molicular docking. Furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that ACE2 and TMPRSSs are highly coexpressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. Our results provide the bioinformatics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate its potential target cells.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tong Meng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Hao Cao","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Biopharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Hao Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zijian Kang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Da Xu","author_inst":"Depanrtment of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haiyi Gong","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Changhai hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zifu Li","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Changhai hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xingang Cui","author_inst":"Depanrtment of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huji Xu","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haifeng Wei","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Pan","author_inst":"Depanrtment of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rongrong Zhu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Spine and Spinal Cord Injury Repair and Regeneration of Ministry of Education, Orthopaedic Department of Tongji Hospital, School of Life Scien"},{"author_name":"Jianru Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wang Zhou","author_inst":"Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, TsinghuaUniversity"},{"author_name":"Liming Cheng","author_inst":"Division of Spine, Department of Orthopedics, Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jianmin Liu","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Changhai hospital, Second Military Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.10.936898","rel_title":"Alpha-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication","rel_date":"2020-02-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.10.936898","rel_abs":"The main protease of coronaviruses and the 3C protease of enteroviruses share a similar active-site architecture and a unique requirement for glutamine in the P1 position of the substrate. Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued structure-based design of peptidomimetic -ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease:inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the -ketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera. The best near-equipotent inhibitors, 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl) and 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl), display low-micromolar EC50 values against enteroviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures.

Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China. Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification. Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification. Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qingyuan Zhao","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Yang Chen","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Dylan S Small","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lei Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongbing Song","author_inst":"Chinese PLA Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tao Pei","author_inst":"Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Jia","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Dajun Zeng","author_inst":"Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Johan Neyts","author_inst":"Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Adriaan de Wilde","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Eric J.

We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces\/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P<0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte\/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray\/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei-jie Guan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Zheng-yi Ni","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wen-hua Liang","author_inst":"department of thoracic oncology, The First Affiliated Hosptial of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun-quan Ou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Jian-xing He","author_inst":"department of thoracic surgery and oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectio"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"The fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun-liang Lei","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"David SC Hui","author_inst":"Department of Medicine & Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Bin Du","author_inst":"Medical ICU, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lan-juan Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospita"},{"author_name":"Guang Zeng","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kowk-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Control, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, People's Republic of China;

Local cycles of transmission already occurred in 7 countries following case importation. No African country has reported cases yet. The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marius Gilbert","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Pinotti","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Valdano","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States"},{"author_name":"Chiara Poletto","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Yves Boelle","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Eric D'Ortenzio","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Serge Paul Eholie","author_inst":"Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Treichville, Abidjan, Ivory Coast"},{"author_name":"Mathias Altmann","author_inst":"IDLIC, Bordeaux, France"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Gutierrez","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Moritz U.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun

We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia and Europe, and we investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Boldog","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Tamas Tekeli","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Vizi","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Attila Denes","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Ferenc Bartha","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Gergely Rost","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Manyun Liu","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sylvia K.

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yadi Zhou","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hou","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Shen","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yin Huang","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"William Martin","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Feixiong Cheng","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Manyun Liu","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sylvia K.

Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. We also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion.

Aim: We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020. Methods: A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shengjie Lai","author_inst":"WorldPop, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"Bluedot"},{"author_name":"Nick Ruktanonchai","author_inst":"WorldPop, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Alexander Watts","author_inst":"Bluedot"},{"author_name":"Xin Lu","author_inst":"National University of Defense Technology, Changsha"},{"author_name":"Weizhong Yang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Kamran Khan","author_inst":"Bluedot"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"WorldPop, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Lone Simonsen","author_inst":"Roskilde University"},{"author_name":"Cecile G.

For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000). Although the estimates of maximum cases increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid-February in contrast to the unconfined exponential growth. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Slav W Hermanowicz","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"Bluedot"},{"author_name":"Nick Ruktanonchai","author_inst":"WorldPop, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Alexander Watts","author_inst":"Bluedot"},{"author_name":"Xin Lu","author_inst":"National University of Defense Technology, Changsha"},{"author_name":"Weizhong Yang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Kamran Khan","author_inst":"Bluedot"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"WorldPop, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Lone Simonsen","author_inst":"Roskilde University"},{"author_name":"Cecile G.

If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission). The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients.

We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province. Methods: A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview. Results: A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan. Conclusions: We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing. Our findings indicate that human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from family to community in Guangdong Province.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Min

(2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, China and has been causing an unprecedented outbreak in China. The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence. Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities. We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high , the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low , the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hsiang-Yu Yuan","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"M.

Here we present an effort to compile epidemiological information on 2019-nCoV from media news reports and a physician community website (dxy.cn) between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020, as the outbreak entered its 7th week. We compiled a line list of patients reported in China and internationally and daily case counts by Chinese province. We describe the demographics, hospitalization and reporting delays for 288 patients, over time and geographically. We find a decrease in case detection lags in provinces outside of Wuhan and internationally, compared to Wuhan, and after Jan 18, 2020, as outbreak awareness increased. The rapid progression of reported cases in different provinces of China is consistent with local transmission beyond Wuhan. The age profile of cases points at a deficit among children under 15 years of age, possibly related to prior immunity with related coronavirus or behavioral differences. Overall, our datasets, which have been publicly available since Jan 21, 2020, align with official reports from Chinese authorities published more than a week later. Availability of publicly available datasets in the early stages of an outbreak is important to encourage disease modeling efforts by independent academic modeling teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center,

We estimate the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95% CI 4.4-6.0), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3, 15.3) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 64 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Whether this risk is acceptable depends on the underlying risk of infection and consequences of missed cases. The estimates presented here can be used to inform policy in multiple contexts based on these judgments.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen A Lauer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kyra H Grantz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Qifang Bi","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Forrest K Jones","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Qulu Zheng","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hannah Meredith","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lirong Zou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Changwen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Haojie Zhong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yingtao Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xuguang Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhe Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianpeng Xiao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiang Yu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiong Hu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Weilin Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xing Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuhuang Liao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenznen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Songjian Xiao","author_inst":"Zhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Nanshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yingchao Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xue Zhuang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lijun Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Siqing Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guanhao He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Huihong Deng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chang-jiang Ye","author_inst":"Xiantao First People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shao-yong Zhu","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Huangpi District"},{"author_name":"Nan-shan Zhong","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.02.931162","rel_title":"Phylogenomic analysis of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-02-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.02.931162","rel_abs":"There is rising global concern for the recently emerged novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov).

We confirm high sequence similarity (>99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hyper-variable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine\/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carmine Ceraolo","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Federico M Giorgi","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Qifang Bi","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Forrest K Jones","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Qulu Zheng","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hannah Meredith","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lirong Zou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Changwen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Haojie Zhong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yingtao Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xuguang Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhe Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianpeng Xiao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiang Yu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiong Hu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Weilin Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xing Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuhuang Liao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenznen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Songjian Xiao","author_inst":"Zhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Nanshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yingchao Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xue Zhuang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lijun Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Siqing Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guanhao He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Huihong Deng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chang-jiang Ye","author_inst":"Xiantao First People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shao-yong Zhu","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Huangpi District"},{"author_name":"Nan-shan Zhong","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.03.931766","rel_title":"Specific ACE2 Expression in Cholangiocytes May Cause Liver Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection","rel_date":"2020-02-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.03.931766","rel_abs":"A newly identified coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Chai","author_inst":"Department of Liver Surgery and Transplantation, Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University;
