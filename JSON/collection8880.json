Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed ~96% genomic similarity with bat CoV (RaTG13) and clustered together in phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, RaTGl3 also showed 97.43% spike protein similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that RaTGl3 is the closest strain. However, RBD and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human-to-human and cross-species transmission are homologues between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoVs. These results from our analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus of bat and pangolin CoVs. Moreover, this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes signifying its aptitude for evolution. In short, our findings propose that homologous recombination has been occurred between bat and pangolin CoVs that triggered cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and, during the ongoing outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving for its adaptability.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiao-Mei Huang","author_inst":"Hainan University"},{"author_name":"Syed Sajid Jan","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobin Wei","author_inst":"Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yi Wan","author_inst":"Hainan University"},{"author_name":"Songying Ouyang","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.14.20034884","rel_title":"Modelling the epidemic 2019-nCoV event in Italy: a preliminary note","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.14.20034884","rel_abs":"An analysis of the time evolution of the 2019-nCoV outbreak event in Italy is proposed and is based on the preliminary data at disposal (till March 11th, 2020) on one side, and on an epidemiological model recently used to describe the same epidemic event in the Wuhan region (February 2020) on the other side.

The viral spike protein S binds ACE2 on host cells to initiate molecular events that release the viral genome intracellularly. Soluble ACE2 inhibits entry of both SARS and SARS-2 coronaviruses by acting as a decoy for S binding sites, and is a candidate for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic development. Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2 are identified with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of S. Mutations are found across the interface, in the N90-glycosylation motif, and at buried sites where they are predicted to enhance local folding and presentation of the interaction epitope. When single substitutions are combined, large increases in binding can be achieved. The mutational landscape offers a blueprint for engineering high affinity proteins and peptides that block receptor binding sites on S to meet this unprecedented challenge.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erik Procko","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Carla Caponi","author_inst":"Clinica Geriatrica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria\\\\Piazzale Gambuli 1, 06132, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Vittorio De Socio","author_inst":"Clinica Malattie Infettive, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria\\\\Piazzale Gambuli 1, 06132, Perugia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Yi Wan","author_inst":"Hainan University"},{"author_name":"Songying Ouyang","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.14.20035964","rel_title":"Covid-19 pandemic: on a simple way to visualize the epidemic states and trajectories of some European countries, and to assess the effect of delays in official response","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.14.20035964","rel_abs":"We present a self-synchronizing and robust method for comparing the progression of the Covid-19 epidemics among multiple countries.

Although it is still not fully established if RNA viruses could generate miRNAs that would target their own genes or alter the host gene expression, there are examples of miRNAs functioning as an antiviral defense mechanism. In the case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are several mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with replication, translation and even modulating the host expression. In this study, we performed a machine learning based miRNA prediction analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify miRNA-like hairpins and searched for potential miRNA - based interactions between the viral miRNAs and human genes and human miRNAs and viral genes. Our PANTHER gene function analysis results indicate that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in crucial cellular processes including transcription. For instance, a transcriptional regulator, STAT1 and transcription machinery might be targeted by virus-derived miRNAs. In addition, many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes. Considering the fact that miRNA-based therapies have been successful before, comprehending mode of actions of miRNAs and their possible roles during SARS-CoV-2 infections could create new opportunities for the development and improvement of new therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muserref Duygu Sacar Demirci","author_inst":"Abdullah Gul University"},{"author_name":"Aysun Adan","author_inst":"Abdullah Gul University"},{"author_name":"Hubert Gallee","author_inst":"IGE UGA-CNRS"},{"author_name":"Yi Wan","author_inst":"Hainan University"},{"author_name":"Songying Ouyang","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.13.20035261","rel_title":"The effects of border control and quarantine measures on global spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.13.20035261","rel_abs":"The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an \"easy-to-use\" mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R0 = 2.92 and latent period {tau} = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M.

The mortality of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in severe and critical cases is very high. Facing this kind of public health emergency, high efficient administrative emergency responsive mode in designated hospital is needed. Method: As an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, our hospital is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a medium-sized city. Novel coronavirus pneumonia department, which is administrative led by the president of hospital directly, has been established at early stage of epidemic crisis in my hospital. In NCP department, there are core members of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Don't stick to national guidelines of NCP, based on professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert group, we focused on individualized treatment and timely adjustment of treatment and management strategies in working about COVID-19 patients. Results: 1. High working efficiency: By Mar 02, 2020, we have completed 2974 citywide consultations and treatment of 366 inpatients, including 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. 2. Excellent therapeutic effectAmong 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, all were cured and discharged, except for one death. No secondary hospital infection, no pipeline infection and no pressure sore were found in all patients. 3. Finding and confirming person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19 prior to official release conference: Strengthened protection is key point to zero infection in healthcare group and medical faculty and lower rate of second generation infectious patients. 4. Timely adjustment management and treatment strategy prior to guideline update: The first evidence of digestive tract involvement in COVID-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out in our hospital. Conclusions: In our hospital, establishment of NCP department, which is administratively led by the president of hospital directly and specialized conduct by respiratory professor, is the key to success in management and treatment of COVID-19 patients. This hospital emergency responsive mode could provide reference for other hospitals and cities in epidemic situation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhonghe Li","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Qu","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobin Zheng","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Changli Tu","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Meizhu Chen","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Cuiyan Tan","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Liu","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yan-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.16.990317","rel_title":"Recapitulation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Cholangiocyte Damage with Human Liver Organoids","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.16.990317","rel_abs":"The newly emerged pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has posed a significant public health threat worldwide. However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which would facilitate novel drug discovery.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bing Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chao Ni","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ran Gao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Li Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ting Lv","author_inst":"Institute of Antibiotics, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jianqing Liang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qisheng Zhang","author_inst":"Sino Organoid Lifesciences Ltd."},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Junbo Liang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Lin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.13.20035428","rel_title":"Serological immunochromatographic approach in diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.13.20035428","rel_abs":"An outbreak of new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other cities and nations.

In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was excreted from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs, and detected in type I and II pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and mucous glands of the nasal cavity. In SARS-CoV-infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, while they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes.

Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020. Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan. Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P<0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020. Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zaixing Shi","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"},{"author_name":"Ya Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"},{"author_name":"Sander Herfst","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Theo Bestebroer","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Mart Lamers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Dennis de Meulder","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Geert van Amerongen","author_inst":"Viroclinics Xplore"},{"author_name":"Judith van de Brand","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Nisreen Okba","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Debby Schipper","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Lonneke Leijten","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Ernst Verschoor","author_inst":"BPRC"},{"author_name":"Babs Verstrepen","author_inst":"BPRC"},{"author_name":"Jan Langermans","author_inst":"BPRC"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Martje Fentener van Vlissingen","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Ron Fouchier","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rik L. de Swart","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Taiqing Feng","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.15.20033472","rel_title":"Blood single cell immune profiling reveals the interferon-MAPK pathway mediated adaptive immune response for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.15.20033472","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an ongoing global health emergence, but the pathogenesis remains unclear.

The number of specific subtypes of immune cells changed significantly when compared patients with controls. Activation of the interferon-MAPK pathway is the major defense mechanism, but MAPK transcription signaling is inhibited in cured patients. TCR and BCR V(D)J recombination is highly diverse in generating different antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far. Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Results: Of 77 patients, there are 34 (44.2%) males, 24 (31.2%) with comorbidities, 22 (28.6%) lymphopenia, 20 (26.0%) categorized as severe patients, and 28 (36.4%) occurred complications. By the end of follow-up, 64 (83.1%) patients were discharged home after being tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infections, 8 remained in hospital and 5 died. 36 (46.8%) patients were discharged within 14 days and thus reached the study endpoint, including 34 (59.6%) of 57 non-severe patients and 2 (10%) of 20 severe patients. The overall cumulative probability of the endpoint was 48.3%. Hospital length of stay and duration of exposure to discharge for 64 discharged patients were 13 (10-16.5) and 23 (18-24.5) days, respectively. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model showed bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter time from the illness onset to admission, the severity of disease and lymphopenia were independently associated with longer hospitalized duration. Conclusions: COVID-19 has significantly shorter duration of disease and hospital length of stay than SARS. Bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter period of illness onset to admission, lymphopenia, the severity of disease are the risk factors for longer hospitalization duration of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wen Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shikai Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiangyi Zha","author_inst":"Hangzhou Dianzi University"},{"author_name":"Ning Wang","author_inst":"Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qiumei Pang","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tongzeng Li","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Aixin Li","author_inst":"Department of Infection Diseases, Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunfang You","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Zigong First People's Hospital, Zigong, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Long","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Zeng","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Mei Luo","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanwei Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxin Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqiang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Xingxiang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenglin Yang","author_inst":"The Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study of Sichuan Province and the Center of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of E"},{"author_name":"Ron Fouchier","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rik L. de Swart","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Taiqing Feng","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.13.20035386","rel_title":"Multi-city modeling of epidemics using spatial networks: Application to 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus in India","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.13.20035386","rel_abs":"The ongoing pandemic of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus has made reliable epidemiological modeling an urgent necessity. Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. Thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after restricting international migration.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhalchandra S Pujari","author_inst":"Savitribai Phule Pune University"},{"author_name":"Snehal M Shekatkar","author_inst":"Savitribai Phule Pune University"},{"author_name":"Xiangyi Zha","author_inst":"Hangzhou Dianzi University"},{"author_name":"Ning Wang","author_inst":"Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qiumei Pang","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tongzeng Li","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Aixin Li","author_inst":"Department of Infection Diseases, Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunfang You","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Zigong First People's Hospital, Zigong, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Long","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Zeng","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Mei Luo","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanwei Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxin Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqiang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Xingxiang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenglin Yang","author_inst":"The Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study of Sichuan Province and the Center of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of E"},{"author_name":"Ron Fouchier","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rik L. de Swart","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Taiqing Feng","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.13.20035642","rel_title":"Epidemiological Trends of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.13.20035642","rel_abs":"Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic broke out in Wuhan, China, and it spread rapidly. Since January 23, 2020, China has launched a series of unusual and strict measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan city to contain this highly contagious disease. We collected the epidemiological data to analyze the trend of this epidemic in China. Methods: We closely tracked the Chinese and global official websites to collect the epidemiological information about COVID-19. The number of total and daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was presented to illustrate the trend of this epidemic. Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On February 6, 2020, there were 31211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January 23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of 890 on the eleventh day and then it declined to a low level of 34 within two full-length incubation periods (28 days), and the number of daily new cases in Hubei also started to decrease on the twelfth day, from 3156 on February 4, 2020 to 955 on February 15, 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has been primarily contained in China. The battle against this epidemic in China has provided valuable experiences for the rest of the world. Strict measures need to be taken as earlier as possible to prevent its spread.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bilin Chen","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan Zhong","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Yueyan Ni","author_inst":"Jinling, Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lulu Liu","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Jinjin Zhong","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Xin Su","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Aixin Li","author_inst":"Department of Infection Diseases, Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunfang You","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Zigong First People's Hospital, Zigong, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Long","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Zeng","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Mei Luo","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanwei Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxin Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqiang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Xingxiang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenglin Yang","author_inst":"The Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study of Sichuan Province and the Center of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of E"},{"author_name":"Ron Fouchier","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rik L. de Swart","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Taiqing Feng","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.14.20035741","rel_title":"Excess cases of Influenza like illnesses in France synchronous with COVID19 invasion.","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.14.20035741","rel_abs":"Several French regions where COVID19 has been reported currently show a renewed increase in ILI cases in the general practice based Sentinelles network.

In January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Interest (PHEI). Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a COVID-19 epidemic in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We used a generalized SEIR (Susceptibles, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model, with additional Hospitalized variables (SEIHR model) and age-stratified structure to analyze the expected time evolution during the onset of the epidemic in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. The model allows to determine the evolution of the number of cases, the number of patients admitted to hospitals and deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to investigate the sensibility of our results with respect to parameter estimation errors we performed Monte Carlo analysis with 100 000 simulations by sampling parameter values from an uniform distribution in the confidence interval. Results: We estimate 1 368 (IQR: 880, 2 407) cases, 301 (22%) in older people (more than 60 years), 81 (50, 143) hospitalizations, and 14 (9, 26) deaths in the first 30 days, and 38 583 (IQR: 16 698, 113, 163) cases, 8 427 (21.8%) in older people (more than 60 years), 2181 (914, 6392) hospitalizations, and 397(166, 1205) deaths in the first 60 days. Limitations: We supposed a constant transmission probability Pc among different age-groups, and that every severe and critic case will be hospitalized, as well as that the detection capacity in all the primary healthcare services does not change during the outbreak. Conclusion: Supposing the reported parameters in the literature apply in the city of Sao Paulo, our study shows that it is expected that the impact of a COVID-19 outbreak will be important, requiring special planning from the authorities. This is the first study for a major metropolitan center in the south hemisphere, and we believe it can provide policymakers with a prognosis of the burden of the pandemic not only in Brazil, but also in other tropical zones, allowing to estimate total cases, hospitalization, and deaths, in support to the management of the public health emergence caused by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tarcisio M Rocha Filho","author_inst":"International Center for Condensed Matter Physics and Instituto de Fisica, Universidade de Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, BRAZIL"},{"author_name":"Fabiana S.

Methods We collected data from most popular social medias: Sina Weibo, Baidu search engine, and Ali e-commerce marketplace, from 1 Dec 2019 to 15 Feb 2020. Weibo post counts and Baidu searches were used to generate indices assessing public attention. Public intention and actual adoption of recommended protection measures or panic buying triggered by rumours and misinformation were measured by Baidu and Ali indices. Qualitative Weibo posts were analysed by the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count text analysis programme to assess public emotion responses to epidemiological events, governments' announcements, and control measures. Findings We identified two missed windows of opportunity for early epidemic control of the COVID-19 outbreak, one in Dec 2019 and the other between 31 Dec and 19 Jan, when public attention was very low despite the emerging outbreak. Delayed release of information ignited negative public emotions. The public responded quickly to government announcements and adopted recommended behaviours according to issued guidelines. We found rumours and misinformation regarding remedies and cures led to panic buying during the outbreak, and timely clarification of rumours effectively reduced irrational behaviour. Interpretation Social media surveillance can enable timely assessments of public reaction to risk communication and epidemic control measures, and the immediate clarification of rumours. This should be fully incorporated into epidemic preparedness and response systems.

Given the rapid increase in the number of local cases, the availability of accurate, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing is vital to efforts to manage the current public health crisis. In the course of optimizing SARS-CoV-2 testing performed by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Lab (UW Virology Lab), we tested assays using seven different primer\/probe sets and one assay kit. We found that the most sensitive assays were those the used the E-gene primer\/probe set described by Corman et al. (Eurosurveillance 25(3), 2020, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2807\/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045) and the N2 set described by the CDC (Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/downloads\/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.pdf). All assays tested were found to be highly specific for SARS-CoV-2, with no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses observed in our analyses regardless of the primer\/probe set or kit used. These results will provide invaluable information to other clinical laboratories who are actively developing SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols at a time when increased testing capacity is urgently needed worldwide.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda M.

The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been revealed recently. However, the information of paediatric patients remains unclear. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making. METHODS and FINDINGS This retrospective, observational study was a case series performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final follow-up visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, IQR 10.00 - 94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included. 47.60% of patients were noticed without any exposure history. The median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days. Infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%), and expectoration (20.59%). Vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A remarkable increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (85.00%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (58.62%), while a decrease of prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (78.13%). In addition, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase was increased significantly in 28 patients (82.35%), as well as -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in 25 patients (73.53%). Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82.36%). The typical feature of ground-glass opacity for adults was rare in paediatric patients (2.94%). A late-onset pattern of lesions in lobules were also noticed. Stratified analysis of the clinical features were not performed due to relatively limited samples. CONCLUSIONS Our data presented the clinical and epidemiological features of paediatric patients systemically. The findings offer new insight into the early identification and intervention of paediatric patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Che Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jiaowei Gu","author_inst":"Affiliated Taihe Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Quanjing Chen","author_inst":"Dongfeng Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Na Deng","author_inst":"Shiyan People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jingfeng Li","author_inst":"Affiliated Taihe Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Li Huang","author_inst":"Affiliated Taihe Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xihui Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Haiying Zhu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alexander L.

This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared among severe and nonsevere patients. Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Laboratory parameters in patients with different immune response phenotypes and disease severities were analyzed. Findings: A total of 222 patients were included in this study. IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness, and its peak levels occurred in the fourth week. Severe cases were more frequently found in patients with high IgG levels, compared to those who with low IgG levels (51.8% versus 32.3%; p=0.008). Severity rates for patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 72.3%, 48.5%, 33.3%, and 15.6%, respectively (p<0.0001). Furthermore, severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo had higher proinflammatory cytokines levels including IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased CD4+ T cell count compared to those with NLRloIgGlo phenotype (p<0.05). Recovery rate for severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 58.8% (20\/34), 68.8% (11\/16), 80.0% (4\/5), and 100% (12\/12), respectively (p=0.0592). Dead cases only occurred in NLRhiIgGhi and NLRhiIgGlo phenotypes. Interpretation: COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bicheng Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Zhou","author_inst":"Cardiac Care Unit, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chengliang Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fan Feng","author_inst":"Cancer Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yanru Qiu","author_inst":"Cancer Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jia Feng","author_inst":"Cancer Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Jia","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qibin Song","author_inst":"Cancer Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University,"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang Sr.","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tao Zeng","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Mei Luo","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanwei Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxin Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqiang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Xingxiang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenglin Yang","author_inst":"The Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study of Sichuan Province and the Center of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of E"},{"author_name":"Ron Fouchier","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rik L. de Swart","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Taiqing Feng","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.13.20035329","rel_title":"Influence factors of death risk among COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China: a hospital-based case-cohort study","rel_date":"2020-03-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.13.20035329","rel_abs":"Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely pandemic all over the world. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence factors of death risk among 200 COVID-19 patients. Methods. Two hundred patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from electronic medical records. Biochemical indexes on admission were measured and patient's prognosis was tracked. The association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and biochemical indexes with death risk was analyzed. Results. Of 200 COVID-19 patients, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. Among all patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. Severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300, were 29.7%. Besides, common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 44.1%. At the end of follow-up, 34 (17%) were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. On admission, 85.5% COVID-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries. Univariable logistic regression showed that ALT and TBIL, two indexes of hepatic injury, AST, myoglobin and LDH, AST\/ALT ratio, several markers of myocardial injury, creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that AST\/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion. Older age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. AST\/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission may be potential prognostic indicators. Early hospitalization is of great significance to prevent multiple organ damage and improve the survival of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lin Fu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Fei","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui-Xian Xiang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ying Xiang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhu-Xia Tan","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Meng-Die Li","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fang-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong-Yan Liu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ling Zheng","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ying Li","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fanwei Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxin Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqiang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Xingxiang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenglin Yang","author_inst":"The Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study of Sichuan Province and the Center of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of E"},{"author_name":"Ron Fouchier","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rik L. de Swart","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Taiqing Feng","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.13.20035212","rel_title":"Triaging patients in the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-03-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.13.20035212","rel_abs":"In the end of 2019, the epidemic of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan and spread rapidly.

To control the transmission of the coronavirus and avoid nosocomial infection, triage procedures based on epidemiology were implemented in a local hospital of the city. This retrospective study analyzed the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID-19 patients were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history. Eight COVID-19 cases were spotted out of 247 suspected patients. More than 50% of the suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 239 patients who were diagnosed as negative of the virus infection,188 were successfully revisited and none was reported as a COVID-19 case. Of the eight COVID-19 patients, three were confirmed only after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis. Besides comorbidities, delayed sharing of epidemiological history added another layer of complexity to the diagnosis in practice.

Using data on local transmissions until the 23rd of March 2020, we develop an ensemble of 200 ecological niche models to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout a typical climatological year. Although cases of COVID-19 are reported all over the world, most outbreaks display a pattern of clustering in relatively cool and dry areas. The predecessor SARS-CoV-1 was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV-2 continue to follow current trends, asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks could be expected. According to the models, temperate warm and cold climates are more favorable to spread of the virus, whereas arid and tropical climates are less favorable. However, model uncertainties are still high across much of sub- Saharan Africa, Latin America and South East Asia. While models of epidemic spread utilize human demography and mobility as predictors, climate can also help constrain the virus. This is because the environment can mediate human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and unsuitable climates can cause the virus to destabilize quickly, hence reducing its capacity to become epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel B.

It has been designated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC). Object: This study predicts the effectiveness of VEC enduring and after its implementation. Method: We applied a simple susceptible-infected-recovery model to data of patients with symptoms in Japan during 14 January to VEC introduction and after VEC introduction to 8 March. We adjusted the reporting delay in the latest few days. Results: Results suggest that the basic reproduction number, R0, before VEC introduced as 2.50 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was [2.43, 2.55] and the effective reproduction number, Rv, after VEC introduced as 1. 88; its 95% CI was [1.68,2.02]. Discussion and Conclusion: Results demonstrated that VEC can reduce COVID-19 infectiousness by 35%, but R0 remains higher than one.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yoshiyuki Sugishita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Junko Kurita","author_inst":"Center for Medical Sciences, Ibaraki Prefectural University of Health Sciences, Ibaraki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Tamie Sugawara","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Ohkusa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Xiaoye Mo","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jia Li","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Ping Wu","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Ruolong Wang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Fangyi Zhou","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jing Wu","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Bin Yi","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zeng Xiong","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhou","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Fanqi Wang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yangjing Tian","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wenbao Hu","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xia Xu","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Ruonan Zhai","author_inst":"the Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Kai Yuan","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangmin Li","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinjian Qiu","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jian Qiu","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Aimin Wang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
