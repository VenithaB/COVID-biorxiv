Objective: To quantify the economic value of the costs and benefits of a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to alternative COVID-19 response strategies in the United States. Design: We estimate the number and value of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained from mortality averted, with a value of $125,000 per QALY, and compare these benefits to the associated costs in terms of plausible effects on US GDP under a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to a policy of full reopening toward herd immunity. Using the same QALY value assumptions, we further evaluate cost-effectiveness of a return to Shelter-in-Place relative to a policy of limited reopening. Setting: United States Measurements: QALY and cost as percent of GDP of limited reopening with continued social distancing relative to a strategy of full reopening aimed at achieving herd immunity; a limited reopening budget measured in the number of months before this strategy fails to demonstrate cost-effectiveness relative to a full reopening; a shelter-in-place threshold measured in the number of lives saved at which a month of sheltering in place demonstrates cost effectiveness relative to the limited reopening strategy. Results: QALY benefits from mortality averted by continued social distancing and limited reopening relative to a policy of full reopening exceed projected GDP costs if an effective vaccine or therapeutic can be developed within 11.1 months from late May 2020. White House vaccine projections fall within this date, supporting a partial reopening strategy. One month of shelter-in-place restrictions provides QALY benefits from averted mortality that exceed the associated GDP costs relative to limited reopening if the restrictions prevent at least 154,586 additional COVID-19 deaths over the course of the pandemic. Current models of disease progression suggest that limited reopening will not cause this many additional deaths, again supporting a limited reopening strategy. Limitation: Limited horizon of COVID-19 mortality projections; infection fatality ratio stable across strategies, ignoring both the potential for ICU overload to increase mortality and the deployment of partially effective therapeutics to decrease mortality; effect on GDP modeled as constant within a given phase of the pandemic; accounts for age and sex distribution of QALYs, but not effect of comorbidities; only considers impact from QALY lost due to mortality and from changes in GDP, excluding numerous other considerations, such as non-fatal COVID-19 morbidity, reduced quality of life caused by prolonged social distancing, or educational regression associated with prolonged school closures and restrictions. Conclusions: A limited reopening to achieve partial mitigation of COVID-19 is cost effective relative to a full reopening if an effective therapeutic or vaccine can be deployed within 11.1 months of late May 2020. One additional month of shelter-in-place restrictions should only be imposed if it saves at least 154,586 lives per month before the development of an effective therapeutic or vaccine relative to limited reopening.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert B Schonberger","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yair J Listokin","author_inst":"Yale Law School"},{"author_name":"Ian Ayres","author_inst":"Yale Law School"},{"author_name":"Reza Yaesoubi","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Zachary R Shelley","author_inst":"Yale Law School"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20140905","rel_title":"Forecasting COVID-19 Dynamics and Endpoint in Bangladesh: A Data-driven Approach","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20140905","rel_abs":"On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed that atypical pneumonia-like cases have emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China. WHO identified it as a novel coronavirus and declared a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020. At the time of writing this, the COVID-19 claimed more than 440 thousand lives worldwide and led to the global economy and social life into an abyss edge in the living memory. As of now, the confirmed cases in Bangladesh have surpassed 100 thousand and more than 1343 deaths putting startling concern on the policymakers and health professionals; thus, prediction models are necessary to forecast a possible number of cases in the future. To shed light on it, in this paper, we presented data-driven estimation methods, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Logistic Curve methods to predict the possible number of COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh for the upcoming months. The results using Logistic Curve suggests that Bangladesh has passed the inflection point on around 28-30 May 2020, a plausible end date to be on the 2nd of January 2021 and it is expected that the total number of infected people to be between 187 thousand to 193 thousand with the assumption that stringent policies are in place. The logistic curve also suggested that Bangladesh would reach peak COVID-19 cases at the end of August with more than 185 thousand total confirmed cases, and around 6000 thousand daily new cases may observe. Our findings recommend that the containment strategies should immediately implement to reduce transmission and epidemic rate of COVID-19 in upcoming days.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Al-Ekram Elahee Hridoy","author_inst":"Department of Geography and Environmental Studies, University of Chittagong, Chittagong  4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Naim","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North South University, Dhaka 1229, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nazim Uddin Emon","author_inst":"3Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science and Engineering, International Islamic University Chittagong, Chittagong 4318, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Imrul Hasan Tipo","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chittagong, Chittagong 4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Safayet Alam","author_inst":"Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Abdullah Al Mamun","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology, Chittagong  4349, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Safiqul Islam","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali 3814, Bangladesh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20141077","rel_title":"Analyses and Forecast for COVID-19 epidemic in India","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20141077","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that is causing havoc to the entire world due to the newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the dynamics of COVID-19 for India and a few selected states with different demographic structures have been analyzed using a SEIRD epidemiological model. A systematic estimation of the basic reproductive ratio R0 is made for India and for each of the selected states. The study has analysed and predicted the dynamics of the temporal progression of the disease in Indian and the selected eight states: Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh. For India, the most optimistic scenario with respect to duration of the epidemic shows, the peak of infection will appear before mid September with the estimated R0=1.917, from the SEIRD model. Further, we show, a Gaussian fit of the daily incidences also indicates the peak will appear around middle of August this year. Our analyses suggest, the earliest dates when the epidemic will start to decline in most states are between Jun-August. For India, the number of infected people at the time of peak will be around 1.6 million including asymptomatic people. If the community transmission is prohibited, then the epidemic will infect not more than 3.1 million people in India. We also compared India's position in containing the disease with two countries with higher and lower number of infections than India and show the early imposition of lockdown has reduced the number of infected cases significantly.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rudra Banerjee","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Srijit Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Pritish Kumar Varadwaj","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Imrul Hasan Tipo","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chittagong, Chittagong 4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Safayet Alam","author_inst":"Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Abdullah Al Mamun","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology, Chittagong  4349, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Safiqul Islam","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali 3814, Bangladesh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20141085","rel_title":"Identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Healthcare Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Units","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20141085","rel_abs":"Available information on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission by small particle aerosols continues to evolve rapidly. To assess the potential role of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in airborne viral transmission, this study sought to determine the viral presence, if any, on air handling units in a healthcare setting where Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were being treated. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in approximately 25% of samples taken from nine different locations in multiple air handlers. While samples were not evaluated for viral infectivity, the presence of viral RNA in air handlers raises the possibility that viral particles can enter and travel within the air handling system of a hospital, from room return air through high efficiency MERV-15 filters and into supply air ducts. Although no known transmission events were determined to be associated with these specimens, the findings suggest the potential for HVAC systems to facilitate transmission by environmental contamination via shared air volumes with locations remote from areas where infected persons reside. More work is needed to further evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via HVAC systems and to verify effectiveness of building operations mitigation strategies for the protection of building occupants. These results are important within and outside of healthcare settings and may present a matter of some urgency for building operators of facilities that are not equipped with high-efficiency filtration.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick F Horve","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"Leslie Dietz","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"Mark Fretz","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"David A Constant","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wilkes","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"John M Townes","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"Robert G Martindale","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"William B Messer","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg","author_inst":"University of Oregon"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20141341","rel_title":"A Streamlined CyTOF Workflow To Facilitate Standardized Multi-Site Immune Profiling of COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20141341","rel_abs":"Mass cytometry (CyTOF) represents one of the most powerful tools in immune phenotyping, allowing high throughput quantification of over 40 single parameters at single-cell resolution. However, wide deployment of CyTOF-based immune phenotyping studies are limited by complex experimental workflows and the need for specialized CyTOF equipment and technical expertise. Furthermore, differences in cell isolation and enrichment protocols, antibody reagent preparation, sample staining and data acquisition protocols can all introduce technical variation that can potentially confound integrative analyses of large data-sets of samples processed across multiple labs. Here, we present a streamlined whole blood CyTOF workflow which addresses many of these sources of experimental variation and facilitates wider adoption of CyTOF immune monitoring across sites with limited technical expertise or sample-processing resources or equipment. Our workflow utilizes commercially available reagents including the Fluidigm MaxPar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (MDIPA), a dry tube 30-marker immunophenotyping panel, and SmartTube Proteomic Stabilizer, which allows for simple and reliable fixation and cryopreservation of whole blood samples. We validate a workflow that allows for streamlined staining of whole blood samples with minimal processing requirements or expertise at the site of sample collection, followed by shipment to a central CyTOF core facility for batched downstream processing and data acquisition. We further demonstrate the application of this workflow to characterize immune responses in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, highlighting key disease-associated changes in immune cell frequency and phenotype.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Geanon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.

This is especially important in real-time surveillance, where the aim is to gain situational awareness, e.g., if cases are currently increasing or decreasing. Reporting delays between disease onset and case reporting hamper our ability to understand the dynamic of an epidemic close to now when looking at the number of daily reported cases only. Nowcasting can be used to adjust daily case counts for occurred-but-not-yet-reported events. Here, we present a novel application of nowcasting to data on the current COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria. It is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model that considers changes in the reporting delay distribution over time and associated with the weekday of reporting. Furthermore, we present a way to estimate the effective time-dependent case reproduction number Re(t)based on predictions of the nowcast. The approaches are based on previously published work, that we considerably extended and adapted to the current task of nowcasting COVID-19 cases. We provide methodological details of the developed approach, illustrate results based on data of the current epidemic, and evaluate the model based on synthetic and retrospective data on COVID-19 in Bavaria. Results of our nowcasting are reported to the Bavarian health authority and published on a webpage on a daily basis (https:\/\/corona.stat.uni-muenchen.de\/).

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 mortality, and inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection, in UK Biobank participants. Methods UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37-73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration, were linked to COVID-19 mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and COVID-19 death, and poisson regression analyses for the association between 25(OH)D and severe COVID-19 infection. Results Complete data were available for 341,484 UK Biobank participants, of which 656 had inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection and 203 died of COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with severe COVID-19 infection and mortality univariably (mortality HR=0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.998; p=0.016), but not after adjustment for confounders (mortality HR=0.998; 95% CI=0.99-1.01; p=0.696).

However, comparisons based on confirmed case counts alone can be misleading since a higher case count may reflect either a higher disease prevalence or a better rate of disease detection. Using weekly records of viral test results for each state in the US, I demonstrate how confirmed case counts can be adjusted based on the percentage of COVID-19 tests that come back positive. A regression analysis indicates that case counts track better with future hospitalizations and deaths when employing this simple adjustment for testing coverage. Viral testing results can be used as a leading indicator of COVID-19 prevalence, but data reporting standards should be improved, and care should be taken to account for testing coverage when comparing confirmed case counts.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathan Favero","author_inst":"American University"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helmut Kuechenhoff","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoehle","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Yu Shen","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Manon Herbinet","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.

Since then, the situation has worsened with more than 672,000 confirmed cases and at least 36,000 reported deaths at the time of this writing. Accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 is extremely important to offer adequate treatment, and avoid overloading the healthcare system. Characteristics of patients such as age, comorbidities and varied clinical symptoms can help in classifying the level of infection severity, predict the disease outcome and the need for hospitalization. Here, we present a study to predict a poor prognosis in positive COVID-19 patients and possible outcomes using machine learning. The study dataset comprises information of 13,690 patients concerning closed cases due to cure or death. Our experimental results show the disease outcome can be predicted with a ROC AUC of 0.92, Sensitivity of 0.88 and Specificity of 0.82 for the best prediction model. This is a preliminary retrospective study which can be improved with the inclusion of further data. Conclusion: Machine learning techniques fed with demographic and clinical data along with comorbidities of the patients can assist in the prognostic prediction and physician decision-making, allowing a faster response and contributing to the non-overload of healthcare systems.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernanda Sumika Hojo Souza","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Nat\u00e1lia Satchiko Hojo-Souza","author_inst":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Edimilson Batista Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Cristiano Maciel Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ludovico Guidoni","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Gutierrez Karl","author_inst":"Sao Judas Tadeu University, Medical School"},{"author_name":"Sheila J Henderson","author_inst":"Alliant International University"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Zahit Kocak","author_inst":"Department of  Medical Oncology, Meram Faculty of  Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University"},{"author_name":"Yakup Alsancak","author_inst":"Department of  Cardiology , Meram Faculty of  Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University"},{"author_name":"Murat Araz","author_inst":"Department of  Medical Oncology, Meram Faculty of  Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University"},{"author_name":"Sevket Arslan","author_inst":"Department of  Clinical Immunology and Allergy,   Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of  Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.20140269","rel_title":"Vaporized H2O2 decontamination against surrogate viruses for the reuse of N95 respirators in the COVID-19 emergency","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.20140269","rel_abs":"Decontamination of N95 respirators has become critical to alleviate PPE shortages for healthcare workers in the current COVID-19 emergency.

In its guidance entitled 'Recommendations for Sponsors Requesting EUAs for Decontamination and Bioburden Reduction Systems for Surgical Masks and Respirators During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) Public Health Emergency' (May 2020)[1], the FDA recommends a 6-log10 reduction in either the most resistant bacterial spores for the system or in a mycobacterium species to authorize the use of a decontamination method of N95 respirators for single or multiple users. While the goal is primarily inactivation against SARS-CoV-2, testing of decontamination methods against the virus may not always be available. For decontamination methods considered for only single users, the recommendation is a 6-log10 reduction in the infective virus concentration of 3 non-enveloped viruses or in the concentration of two Gram (+) and two Gram (-) bacteria. Based on these recommendations, we explored the efficacy of vaporized H2O2 (VHP) treatment of N95 respirators against surrogate viruses covering a wide range of disinfection resistance for emergency decontamination and reuse to alleviate PPE shortages for healthcare workers in the COVID-19 emergency.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ebru Oral","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Keith K Wannomae","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachel L Connolly","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Joseph A Gardecki","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Min Leung","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Orhun K Muratoglu","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"John Durkin","author_inst":"B & V Testing"},{"author_name":"Ralph Jones","author_inst":"B & V Testing"},{"author_name":"Cassidy Collins","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Julian Gjore","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Amanda Budzilowicz","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Tareq Jaber","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20140657","rel_title":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life, physical and psychosocial wellbeing in breast cancer patients and survivors - A prospective, multicenter cohort study","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20140657","rel_abs":"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting social distancing and lockdown measures are having a substantial impact on daily life and medical management of people with breast cancer. We evaluated to what extent these changes have affected quality of life and physical, and psychosocial wellbeing of people (being) treated for breast cancer. Methods: This study was conducted within the prospective Utrecht cohort for Multiple BREast cancer intervention studies and Long-term evaluation (UMBRELLA). Shortly after the implementation of COVID-19 measures, extra questionnaires were sent to 1595 cohort participants, including standard UMBRELLA quality of life (EORTC) questionnaires. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared to the most recent PROs collected within UMBRELLA before COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on PROs was evaluated using mixed models analysis. Results: In total, 1051 patients (66%) completed the questionnaires. One third (n = 327, 31%) reported a higher threshold to contact their general practitioner due to COVID-19. A significant deterioration in emotional functioning was observed (82.6 to 77.9, p < 0.001) and 505 (48%, 95% CI 45-51) patients reported moderate to severe loneliness. Small significant improvements were observed in QoL, physical-, social- and role functioning scores. In the subgroup of 51 patients under active treatment, there was a strong deterioration in social functioning (69.8 to 5.0, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Due to COVID-19, patients (being) treated for breast cancer are less likely to contact physicians, and experience a deterioration in emotional functioning. Patients undergoing active treatment report a strong drop in social functioning. One in two patients reports (severe) loneliness. Online applications facilitating peer contact and e-mental health interventions could support mental health and social interaction times of total lockdown or social distancing.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudia A Bargon","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Marilot CT Batenburg","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Lilianne E van Stam","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Dieuwke R Mink van der Molen","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Iris E van Dam","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Femke van der Leij","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Inge O Baas","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Miranda F Ernst","author_inst":"Alexander Monro Clinics"},{"author_name":"Wiesje Maarse","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Nieke Vermulst","author_inst":"Rivierenland Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ernst JP Schoenmaeckers","author_inst":"Meander Medisch Centrum"},{"author_name":"Thijs van Dalen","author_inst":"Diakonessenhuis"},{"author_name":"Rhode M Bijlsma","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Danny A Young-Afat","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Annemiek Doeksen","author_inst":"St. Antonius Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helena M Verkooijen","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20140780","rel_title":"Assessing the nationwide impact of COVID-19 mitigation policies on the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20140780","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is now identified in almost all countries in the world, with poorer regions being particularly more disadvantaged to efficiently mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. In the absence of efficient therapeutics or vaccines, control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions, among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 547 published governmental interventions, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were used to calibrate the model parameters using non-linear least squares methods. We analyze the changes on the TR and effective reproduction number as a function of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states as well as population movement. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions, and represents a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel C.

It can be performed by clinicians already at the bedside, which permits an immediate and augmented assessment of a patient. Although lung ultrasound can be used to accurately diagnose a variety of disease states such as pneumothorax, pleural effusions, pneumonia and interstitial lung disease2, there are limited reports on the sonographic manifestations of COVID-19. There is an urgent need to identify alternative diagnostic modalities that can be immediately employed at the bedside of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This study was conducted at two medical centers in the United States from 3\/21\/2020-6\/01\/2020. Any adult who was hospitalized with COVID-19 (based on symptomatology and a confirmatory RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2) and received a pulmonary POCUS examination was included. Providers were instructed to use a 12-zone scanning protocol for pulmonary views and save 6 second clips of each lung zone. This study utilized several POCUS devices, including Butterfly IQ, Vave, Lumify, and Sonosite. The collected images were interpreted by the study researchers based on a consensus document developed by the study authors and previously accepted definitions of lung POCUS findings. Results: A total of 22 eligible patients who received 36 lung scans were included in our study. Eleven (50%) patients experienced clinical deterioration (defined as either ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death within 28 days from the initial symptom onset). Among the 36 lung scans collected, only 3 (8%) were classified as normal. The remaining scans had the following abnormalities: presence of B-lines (n=32, 89%), consolidations (n=20, 56%), pleural thickening (n=17, 47%), and pleural effusion (n=4, 11%). Out of 20 scans with consolidations, 14 (70%) were subpleural and 5 (25%) were translobar. A-lines were present in 26 (72%) of patients, although they were only observed in the majority of the collected lung zones in 5 (14%) of patients. Ultrasound findings were stratified by time from symptom onset to the scan based on the following time periods: early (0-6 days), middle (7-13 days), and late (14-28 days). B-lines appeared early after symptom onset and persisted well into the late disease course. In contrast, pleural thickening increased in frequency over time (early: 25%, middle: 47%, late: 67%). Subpleural consolidations also appeared in higher frequency later in the disease course (early: 13%, middle 42%, late: 56%). Discussion: certain lung ultrasound findings may be common in Covid-19, while others may appear later in the disease course or only occur in patients who experience clinical deterioration. Future efforts should investigate the predictive utility of consolidations, pleural thickening and B-lines for clinical deterioration and compare them to traditional radiological studies such as X-rays or CTs.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre D Kumar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sukyung Chung","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Youyou Duanmu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sally Graglia","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Farhan Lalani","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kavita Gandhi","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Viveta Lobo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Trevor Jensen","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Weng","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nahn","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"John Kugler","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Juliane Fonseca Oliveira","author_inst":"Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health, Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Rhode M Bijlsma","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Danny A Young-Afat","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Annemiek Doeksen","author_inst":"St. Antonius Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helena M Verkooijen","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20139063","rel_title":"Sex, age, and hospitalization drive antibody responses in a COVID-19 convalescent plasma donor population","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20139063","rel_abs":"Convalescent plasma is currently one of the leading treatments for COVID-19, but there is a paucity of data identifying therapeutic efficacy. A comprehensive analysis of the antibody responses in potential plasma donors and an understanding of the clinical and demographic factors that drive variant antibody responses is needed. Among 126 potential convalescent plasma donors, the humoral immune response was evaluated by a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay using Vero-E6-TMPRSS2 cells, commercial IgG and IgA ELISA to Spike (S) protein S1 domain (Euroimmun), IgA, IgG and IgM indirect ELISAs to the full-length S or S-receptor binding domain (S-RBD), and an IgG avidity assay. Multiple linear regression and predictive models were utilized to assess the correlations between antibody responses with demographic and clinical characteristics. IgG titers were greater than either IgM or IgA for S1, full length S, and S-RBD in the overall population. Of the 126 plasma samples, 101 (80%) had detectable neutralizing titers. Using neutralization titer as the reference, the sensitivity of the IgG ELISAs ranged between 95-98%, but specificity was only 20-32%. Male sex, older age, and hospitalization with COVID-19 were all consistently associated with increased antibody responses across the serological assays. Neutralizing antibody titers were reduced over time in contrast to overall antibody responses. There was substantial heterogeneity in the antibody response among potential convalescent plasma donors, but sex, age and hospitalization emerged as factors that can be used to identify individuals with a high likelihood of having strong antiviral antibody levels.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sabra Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pekosz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Han-Sol Park","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Ursin","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Janna Shapiro","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Benner","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Littlefield","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Swetha Kumar","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harnish Mukesh Naik","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Betenbaugh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Ruchee Shrestha","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Annie Wu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Hughes","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Imani Burgess","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patricio Caturegli","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Oliver Laeyendecker","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and NIH\/NIAID"},{"author_name":"Thomas Quinn","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and NIH\/NIAID"},{"author_name":"David Sullivan","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Shoham","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Redd","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20139873","rel_title":"Secondary pneumonia in critically ill ventilated patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20139873","rel_abs":"Background Pandemic COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has a high incidence of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Many of these patients require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for invasive artificial ventilation and are at significant risk of developing a secondary, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Objectives To study the incidence of VAP, as well as differences in secondary infections, and bacterial lung microbiome composition of ventilated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Methods In this prospective observational study, we compared the incidence of VAP and secondary infections using a combination of a TaqMan multi-pathogen array and microbial culture. In addition, we determined the lung microbime composition using 16S RNA analyisis. The study involved eighteen COVID-19 and seven non-COVID-19 patients receiving invasive ventilation in three ICUs located in a single University teaching hospital between April 13th 2020 and May 7th 2020. Results We observed a higher percentage of confirmed VAP in COVID-19 patients. However, there was no statistical difference in the detected organisms or pulmonary microbiome when compared to non-COVID-19 patients. Conclusion COVID-19 makes people more susceptible to developing VAP, partly but not entirely due to the increased duration of ventilation. The pulmonary dysbiosis caused by COVID-19, and the array of secondary infections observed are similar to that seen in critically ill patients ventilated for other reasons.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mailis Maes","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ellen Higginson","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Joana Pereira Dias","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Martin D Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Fahad Khokhar","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cuchet-Louren\u00e7o","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Janine Lux","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sapna Sharma-Hajela","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ravenhill","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Razeen Mahroof","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Amelia Solderholm","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sally Forrest","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"Wellcome  Sanger Insitute, Hinxton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.20139022","rel_title":"Problem drinking before and during the COVID-19 crisis in US and UK adults: Evidence from two population-based longitudinal studies","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.20139022","rel_abs":"Background The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on potentially harmful alcohol consumption is unclear. Aims To test whether the prevalence of problem drinking has changed from before to during the COVID-19 crisis in the US and UK. Design\/Setting We examined nationally representative longitudinal data on how problem drinking has changed from pre-pandemic levels among adults in the US (N=7,327; Understanding America Study) and UK (N=12,594; UK Household Longitudinal Study). Methods In the US, we examined rates of consuming alcohol [&ge;] 4 times in the past week at baseline (March, 2020) and across four waves of follow-up (April-May, 2020). In the UK we assessed the prevalence of consuming alcohol [&ge;] 4 times per week and weekly heavy episodic drinking using the AUDIT-C at baseline (2017-2019) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (April, 2020). We also tested whether there were specific groups at greater risk of increased problem drinking during the pandemic. Results Among US adults, there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of participants reporting drinking alcohol [&ge;] 4 times a week which rose significantly from 11.7% to 17.9% (53% increase, p < .001) as the COVID-19 crisis developed in the US. Among UK adults, the percentage of participants reporting drinking [&ge;] 4 times a week increased significantly from 14.2% to 23% (62% increase, p < .001) and heavy episodic drinking at least weekly increased significantly from 9.7% to 16.6% (71% increase, p < .001) when compared to pre-COVID-19 lockdown levels. Trends were similar across population demographics, although those aged under 50 years and higher income groups displayed the largest increases. Conclusions The COVID-19 crisis has been associated with substantial increases in problematic drinking in both US and UK adults.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Daly","author_inst":"Maynooth University"},{"author_name":"Eric Robinson","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Joana Pereira Dias","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Martin D Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Fahad Khokhar","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cuchet-Louren\u00e7o","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Janine Lux","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sapna Sharma-Hajela","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ravenhill","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Razeen Mahroof","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Amelia Solderholm","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sally Forrest","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"Wellcome  Sanger Insitute, Hinxton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"addiction medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20138545","rel_title":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among workers returning to Bihar gives snapshot of COVID across India","rel_date":"2020-06-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20138545","rel_abs":"India has reported the fourth highest number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases worldwide.

Comparison of locations with over 50 deaths shows all outbreaks have a common feature: H(t) defined as loge(X(t)\/X(t 1)) decreases linearly on a log scale, where X(t) is the total number of Cases or Deaths on day, t (we use ln for loge). The downward slopes vary by about a factor of three with time constants (1\/slope) of between 1 and 3 weeks; this suggests it may be possible to predict when an outbreak will end. Is it possible to go beyond this and perform early prediction of the outcome in terms of the eventual plateau number of total confirmed cases or deaths? We test this hypothesis by showing that the trajectory of cases or deaths in any outbreak can be converted into a straight line. Specifically , is a straight line for the correct plateau value N, which is determined by a new method, Best-Line Fitting (BLF). BLF involves a straight-line facilitation extrapolation needed for prediction; it is blindingly fast and amenable to optimization. We find that in some locations that entire trajectory can be predicted early, whereas others take longer to follow this simple functional form. Fortunately, BLF distinguishes predictions that are likely to be correct in that they show a stable plateau of total cases or death (N value). We apply BLF to locations that seem close to a stable predicted N value and then forecast the outcome at some locations that are still growing wildly.

As the etiological coronavirus (a.k.a. SARS-CoV2) may putatively have a bat origin, our understanding about its intermediate reservoir between bats and humans, especially its tropism in wild and domestic animals, are mostly unknown. This constitutes major concerns in public health for the current pandemics and potential zoonosis. Previous reports using structural analysis of the viral spike protein (S) binding its cell receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicate a broad SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in wild and particularly domestic animals. Through integration of key immunogenetic factors, including the existence of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms and the disparity of ACE2 expression upon early innate immune response, we further refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction to fit recent experimental validation. In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections. Thus, we propose that domestic animals may be unlikely to play a role as amplifying hosts unless the virus has further species-specific adaptation. These findings may relieve relevant public concerns regarding COVID-19-like risk in domestic animals, highlight virus-host coevolution, and evoke disease intervention through targeting ACE2 molecular diversity and interferon optimization.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric R.

Assays to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth depend on time-consuming and costly RNA extraction steps, hampering progress in basic research and drug development efforts. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay that bypasses viral RNA extraction steps and can monitor SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics from a small amount of cell culture supernatants. Using this assay, we screened the activities of a number of entry, SARS-CoV-2- and HIV-1-specific inhibitors in a proof of concept study. In line with previous studies which has shown that processing of the viral Spike protein by cellular proteases and endosomal fusion are required for entry, we found that E64D and apilimod potently decreased the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cell culture supernatants with minimal cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, we found that macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA similarly decreased viral RNA in supernatants suggesting that entry may additionally be mediated by an alternative pathway. HIV-1-specific inhibitors nevirapine (an NNRTI), amprenavir (a protease inhibitor), and ALLINI-2 (an allosteric integrase inhibitor) modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, albeit the IC50 values were much higher than that required for HIV-1. Taken together, this facile assay will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to mid-throughput screens to identify chemical inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, and be applicable to a broad number of RNA and DNA viruses.\n\nImportanceSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has quickly become a major global health problem causing immense respiratory disease and social and economic disruptions.

In a proof-of-concept screen, we found that E64D, apilimod, EIPA and remdesivir can substantially impede SARS-Cov-2 replication providing novel insight into viral entry and replication mechanisms.

Here, we developed two modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based vaccines which express either a membrane anchored full-length spike protein (MVA\/S) stabilized in a prefusion state or the S1 region of the spike (MVA\/S1) which forms trimers and is secreted. Both immunogens contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known target of antibody-mediated neutralization. Following immunizations with MVA\/S or MVA\/S1, both spike protein recombinants induced strong IgG antibodies to purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The MVA\/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD, S1 and S2 whereas MVA\/S1 induced an antibody response to the S1 region outside of the RBD region. Both vaccines induced an antibody response in the lung and that was associated with induction of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. MVA\/S but not MVA\/S1 vaccinated mice generated robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 that strongly correlated with RBD antibody binding titers. Mechanistically, S1 binding to ACE-2 was strong but reduced following prolonged pre-incubation at room temperature suggesting confirmation changes in RBD with time. These results demonstrate MVA\/S is a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nanda Kishore Routhu","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Sailaja Gangadhara","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Narayanaiah Cheedarla","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Ayalnesh Shiferaw","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Sheikh Abdul Rahman","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Anusmita Sahoo","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Katharine Floyd","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Fischinger","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Mehul S Suthar","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Rama Rao Amara","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.27.174979","rel_title":"Structures, conformations and distributions of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimers on intact virions","rel_date":"2020-06-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.27.174979","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virions are surrounded by a lipid bilayer from which spike (S) protein trimers protrude. Heavily glycosylated S trimers bind the ACE2 receptor and mediate entry of virions into target cells. S exhibits extensive conformational flexibility: it modulates the exposure of its receptor binding site and later undergoes complete structural rearrangement to drive fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The structures and conformations of soluble, overexpressed, purified S proteins have been studied in detail using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure and distribution of S on the virion surface, however, has not been characterised. Here we applied cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to image intact SARS-CoV-2 virions, determining the high-resolution structure, conformational flexibility and distributions of S trimers in situ on the virion surface. These results provide a basis for understanding the conformations of S present on the virion, and for studying their interactions with neutralizing antibodies.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zunlong Ke","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Oton","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Mirko Cortese","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Vojtech Zila","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Lesley McKeane","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Takanori Nakane","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Jasenko Zivanov","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Neufeldt","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"John M Lu","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Julia Peukes","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Xiong","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Krausslich","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Sjors H.W.

The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the virions surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2). Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus SARS-COV in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of RBD\/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally-occurring mutations to the RBD either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This may have implications for high human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in-silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations, highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors. From an evolutional perspective, this study also identifies how the virus has evolved from its predecessor SARS-COV and how it could further evolve to become more infectious.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahdi Ghorbani","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Bernard R.

A relatively higher divergence on the spike protein of SASR-CoV-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently. We particularly believe that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans. Thus here we collected 2,142 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect humans. Moreover, compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, it is more conserved in the direct-binding sites of RBD and we noticed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better. 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hACE2 (S19-D615) were calculated. Our analysis indicates SARS-CoV-2 could infect humans from different populations with no preference, and a higher divergence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xia Xue","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jianxiang Shi","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Hongen Xu","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaping Qin","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zengguang Yang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Shuaisheng Feng","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danhua Liu","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Liguo Jian","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Linlin Hua","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaohe Wang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xueyong Huang","author_inst":"Henan Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xinxin Li","author_inst":"Henan hospital of infectious diseases"},{"author_name":"Chunguang Chen","author_inst":"Henan hospital of infectious diseases"},{"author_name":"JianCheng Guo","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Wenxue Tang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Liu","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.19.20128207","rel_title":"COVID-19 related concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions: A qualitative study","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.19.20128207","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts on populations globally, with increasing levels of stress, anxiety, and depression being reported, especially in people with pre-existing medical conditions who appear to be particularly vulnerable. There are limited data on the specific concerns people have about COVID-19 and what these are based on. METHODS The aim of this study was to identify and explore the concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions in the UK regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how these concerns were affecting them. We conducted a thematic analysis of free text responses to the question 'What are your main concerns about getting coronavirus?', which was included in the British Lung Foundation\/Asthma UK (BLF-AUK) partnership COVID-19 survey, conducted between the 1st and 8th of April. This was during the 3rd week of the UK's initial social distancing measures. RESULTS 7,039 responses were analysed, with respondents from a wide range of ages, gender, and all UK nations. Respondents reported having asthma (85%), COPD (9%), bronchiectasis (4%), interstitial lung disease (2%), or 'other' lung diseases (e.g. lung cancer) (1%). Four main themes were identified: 1) vulnerability to COVID-19; 2) anticipated experience of contracting COVID-19; 3) wide-reaching uncertainty; and 4) inadequate national response. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts. The concerns we identified largely reflect objective, as well as subjective, aspects of the current situation. Hence, key approaches to reducing these concerns require changes to the reality of their situation, and are likely to include i) helping people optimise their health, limit risk of infection, and access necessities; ii) minimising the negative experience of disease where possible, iii) providing up-to-date, accurate and consistent information, iv) improving the government and healthcare response.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Keir Elmslie James Philip","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Bradley Lonergan","author_inst":"Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrew Cumella","author_inst":"Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Partnership"},{"author_name":"Joe Farrington-Douglas","author_inst":"Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Partnership"},{"author_name":"Michael Laffan","author_inst":"Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Partnership"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Hopkinson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Danhua Liu","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Liguo Jian","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Linlin Hua","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaohe Wang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xueyong Huang","author_inst":"Henan Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xinxin Li","author_inst":"Henan hospital of infectious diseases"},{"author_name":"Chunguang Chen","author_inst":"Henan hospital of infectious diseases"},{"author_name":"JianCheng Guo","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Wenxue Tang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Liu","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20139121","rel_title":"Exploring Causal relationship between risk factors and vulnerability to COVID-19Cases of Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Portugal, Morocco and South Africa","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20139121","rel_abs":"Even though the infection rate of COVID-19 is very high as of today 31 May: 5,819,962 confirmed cases worldwide, the death rate is only about 6.23%, 362,786 deaths as for the same date.
