Two-plex correlation analysis revealed higher binding of serum IgM to RBD than to S1. IgG antibody avidity toward multiple antigens were measured, shedding light on antibody maturation in COVID-19 patients and affording a powerful tool for differentiating recent from remote infections and identifying re-infection by SARS-CoV-2.

In the current study, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as HCV (MFED 7-9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analysed created by several hundred consecutive energetically favoured stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses - even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base-paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus which is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterised, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represent important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3SY, UK."},{"author_name":"Jessica Hsiung","author_inst":"Nirmidas Biotech Inc."},{"author_name":"Su Zhao","author_inst":"Nirmidas Biotech Inc."},{"author_name":"Jessica Kost","author_inst":"Nirmidas Biotech Inc."},{"author_name":"Dee Sreedhar","author_inst":"Nirmidas Biotech Inc."},{"author_name":"Kjerstie Olson","author_inst":"Dr. Jack S.

Several omics studies have extended our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology, including some focused on proteomic aspects1\u20133. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses manipulate the host we here characterized interactome, proteome and signaling processes in a systems-wide manner. This identified connections between the corresponding cellular events, revealed functional effects of the individual viral proteins and put these findings into the context of host signaling pathways. We investigated the closely related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses as well as the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome of a lung-derived human cell line. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed relationships between the perturbations taking place upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different layers and identified unique and common molecular mechanisms of SARS coronaviruses. The results highlight the functionality of individual proteins as well as vulnerability hotspots of SARS-CoV-2, which we targeted with clinically approved drugs. We exemplify this by identification of kinase inhibitors as well as MMPase inhibitors with significant antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexey Stukalov","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Virginie Girault","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Vincent Grass","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Valter Bergant","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ozge Karayel","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Urban","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Darya A.

Recently, crystallographic fragment screening uncovered a large number of molecules binding at the Mpro active site as well as at sites of potential allostery. However, no information on fragment affinity is available. Here, we describe an efficient protocol for screening chemical compounds for binding to Mpro using saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) spectroscopy. We characterised the relative affinity of Mpro-binding fragments using STD-NMR, revealing a ~200-fold difference in binding potential. Combined with crystallographic structures of these fragments bound to Mpro, this information can assist ongoing drug design efforts.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anastassia  L.

The relative contribution of viral transmission via fomites is still unclear. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to survive on inanimate surfaces for several days, yet the factors that determine its survival on surfaces are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for human respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Although saliva microdroplets dried out rapidly at all tested RH levels (unlike SM that remained hydrated at RH [&ge;] 57%), survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly higher than in water or SM. Thus, RH and hydration conditions are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely affect physicochemical properties that determine virus survival. The observed high virus survival in dry saliva deposited on surfaces, under a wide range of RH levels, can have profound implications for human public health, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aliza Fedorenko","author_inst":"The Hebrew Universtiy of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Maor Grinberg","author_inst":"The Hebrew Universtiy of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Tomer Orevi","author_inst":"The Hebrew Universtiy of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Nadav Kashtan","author_inst":"The Hebrew Universtiy of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Ozge Karayel","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Urban","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Darya A.

We used government-reported time series of CoVID-19 cases and deaths stratified by age group and gender. Our estimates as of May 25, 2020, of the aCFR for men and women are 10.8% (95%CrI: 10.5-11.1%) and 6.5% (95%CrI: 6.2-6.8%), respectively, and an overall aCFR of 9.1% (95%CrI: 8.9-9.3%). Our results show that senior individuals are the most severely affected by CoVID-19, particularly men, with aCFR of almost 60% for those aged 80- years. We found that men have a significantly higher cumulative morbidity ratio than women across most age groups (proportion test, p-value< 0.001), with the exception of those aged 0-9 years.

However, there have been no studies in the UK looking at the effect of COVID-19 work pattern on the provision of cardiology services. We aim to assess the impact of the pandemic on the cardiology services and clinical activity. Methods: We analysed key performance indicators in cardiology services in a single centre in the UK in the intervals prior and during the lockdown to assess for reduction or changes to service provisions. Results: There has been more than 50% drop in patients presenting to cardiology and those diagnosed with myocardial infarction. All cardiology service provisions sustained significant reductions which included outpatient clinics, investigations, procedures and cardiology community services such as heart failure and cardiac rehabilitation. Conclusion: As ischaemic heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death nationally and globally, cardiology services need to prepare for a significant increase in workload in the recovery phase and develop new pathways to urgently help those adversely affected by the changes in service provisions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Fersia","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Sue Bryant","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Rachael Nicholson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Karen McMeeken","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Carolyn Brown","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Brenda Donaldson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jardine","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Valerie Grierson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Whalen","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Alistair Mackay","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Shaul Lev","author_inst":"General Intensive Care Unit, HasHasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel; The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, I"},{"author_name":"Antonio Piras","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Tanzer","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fynn M Hansen","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thomas Engleitner","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Reinecke","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Teresa M.

This study primarily focused on what effect smoking had on hospitalization; however, asymptomaticity and severity were discussed. Data: Data was collected through searches on databases including PubMed and Google Scholar. Eligibility criteria included being RT-PCR verified and including smoking data. Discussion: This study found that smokers were significantly underrepresented in COVID-19 hospitalization on a purely epidemiological level in some areas, including China and Manhattan, but not others: Seattle, Greater New York City Area, and Italy. Furthermore, smokers were equally represented in asymptomatic populations, but smokers will likely experience a more severe manifestation of the disease if they are symptomatic. Further inquiry into possible mechanisms by which the observed epidemiological effect is necessary, as it has implications for recommendations on loosening restrictions on social distancing measures. Conclusions and Recommendations: This study recommends that smokers consider themselves to be at higher risk for COVID-19, as they may experience a more severe manifestation of the disease. Health care providers and policymakers should consider smokers at higher risk as well, as there is evidence to claim that smokers may contract a more severe form of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lachezar Balabanski","author_inst":"none"},{"author_name":"Sue Bryant","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Rachael Nicholson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Karen McMeeken","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Carolyn Brown","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Brenda Donaldson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jardine","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Valerie Grierson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Whalen","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Alistair Mackay","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Shaul Lev","author_inst":"General Intensive Care Unit, HasHasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel; The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, I"},{"author_name":"Antonio Piras","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Tanzer","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fynn M Hansen","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thomas Engleitner","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Reinecke","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Teresa M.

The strict enforcement of this curfew was extended through May 25, with a gradual relaxation beginning on May 1. This report summarizes an assessment of these early mitigation measures on the progression of COVID-19 in the island. Methods and Findings: From March 15 to May 15, 2020, 41,748 results of molecular (RT-PCR) tests were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Of these, 1,866 (4.5%) were positive, corresponding to 1,219 individuals with COVID-19 included in the study. We derived the epidemic growth rates (r) and the corresponding reproductive numbers (R) from the epidemic curve of these 1,219 individuals with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using their date of test collection as a proxy for symptoms onset. We then compared the observed cases with the R-based epidemic model projections had the mitigation measures not been implemented. Computations were conducted in the R packages forecast, incidence and projections. The number of daily RT-PCR-confirmed cases peaked on March 30 (84 cases), showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing secular trend since March 30. The initial exponential growth rate (r) was 17.0% (95% CI: 8.4%, 25.6%), corresponding to a doubling of cases every 4.1 days, and to a reproduction number (Ro) of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.41, 2.39). After March 30, the r value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -3.6% (95% CI: -5.7%, -1.4%), corresponding to a halving of cases every 19.4 days and to an Ro of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97). Had the initial growth rate been maintained, a total of 18,699 (96%CI: 4,113, 87,438) COVID-19 cases would have occurred by April 30 compared with 1,119 observed. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with very effective implementation of early non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as mitigation measures in Puerto Rico. These results serve as a baseline to assess the impact of the transition from mitigation to containment stages in Puerto Rico.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel Valencia","author_inst":"Puerto Rico Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Jose E Becerra","author_inst":"University Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus - Graduate School Public Health - Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Juan C Reyes","author_inst":"University Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus - Graduate School Public Health - Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Kenneth G Castro","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Carolyn Brown","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Brenda Donaldson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jardine","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Valerie Grierson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Whalen","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Alistair Mackay","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Shaul Lev","author_inst":"General Intensive Care Unit, HasHasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel; The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, I"},{"author_name":"Antonio Piras","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Tanzer","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fynn M Hansen","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thomas Engleitner","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Reinecke","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Teresa M.

Ten telephonic in-depth interviews and a descriptive survey were conducted to obtain experiences of police regarding their combat against Covid-19. Results: PPR (0.01 to 1.12), CRR (0 to 39.22) and CFR (0 to 1.07) have consistently increased and CRR found lower among police than the general population. The qualitative data by analyzing several indicators suggests that there is a higher individual efficacy over collective efficacy among the police force. Further, the long-time fight against Covid-19 had drained police force mentally and physically and this put them in higher risk. Conclusion: Immediate priority interventions like provision of protective gears need to be provided by the government to control the risk of infection among police.

The aim of this study is to investigate if some health indicators might have been useful to understand the capacity of Italian National Health Service to manage the COVID 19 epidemic. We will compare data in two different Italian regions in the Northern part of Italy (Lombardy and Veneto) with the national data to understand if different health strategies might be significant to explain different patterns of COVID 19 epidemic in Italy. The two regions have two different health policies to face CoViD-2019 epidemic. To face epidemic like this one the answer should be outside hospitals but this means to have general practitioners well-trained and enough healthcare personnel working outside hospitals.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health University of Milan, Italy and Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ester Luconi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Bruno Alessandro Rivieccio","author_inst":"Niguarda Hospital AREU Regional Emergency Service Agency, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Marano","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elena Pariani","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health University of Milan, Italy and Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luisa Romano'","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health University of Milan, Italy and Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Auxilia","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Nicolussi","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Micheletti","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Manzi","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Salini","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences \"L.

Several observational studies have found an association between the A blood group and an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the O blood group appears to be protective. Objective: To investigate the frequency and clinical course of COVID-19 in a large sample of patients who had undergone TAVR and to determine the associations of the ABO blood group with disease occurrence and outcomes. Methods: Patients who had undergone TAVR between 2010 and 2019 were included in this study and followed-up through the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The main outcomes were the occurrence and severity (hospitalization and\/or death) of COVID-19 and their association with the ABO blood group. Results: Of the 1125 patients who had undergone TAVR, 403 (36%) died before January 1, 2020, and 20 (1.8%) were lost to follow-up. The study sample therefore consisted of 702 patients. Among them, we identified 22 cases (3.1%) with COVID-19. Fourteen patients (63.6%) were hospitalized or died of disease. Multivariate analysis identified the A blood group (versus others) as the only independent predictor of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone TAVR (odds ratio [OR] = 6.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.11-18.92; p=0.001). The A blood group (versus others; OR = 8.27; 95% CI = 1.83-37.43, p=0.006) and a history of cancer (OR = 4.99; 95% CI = 1.64-15.27, p = 0.005) were significantly and independently associated with disease severity (hospitalization and\/or death). Conclusions: Patients who had undergone TAVR are vulnerable to COVID-19. The subgroup with the A blood group was especially prone to develop the disease and showed unfavorable outcomes.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marion Kibler","author_inst":"University Hospital Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Adrien Carmona","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Marchandot","author_inst":"University Hospital Of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Kensuke Matsushita","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Antonin Trimaille","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Mohamad Kanso","author_inst":"University Hospital Of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Laurent Dietrich","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Cecile How-Choong","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Albane Odier","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Gennesseaux","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Ophelie Schramm","author_inst":"ophelie.schramm@chru-strasbourg.fr"},{"author_name":"Anne Claire Reydel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Michel Kindo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Minh Hoang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Hess","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Chisato Sato","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Sophie Ohlmann","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Laurence Jesel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Olivier Morel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ohlmann","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard K\u00fcster","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Protzer","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roland Rad","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"John Ziebuhr","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen, Institute of Medical Virology, 35392 Giessen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland & Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pietro Scaturro","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mann","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Pichlmair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129866","rel_title":"Covid-19 rapid test by combining a random forest based web system and blood tests","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129866","rel_abs":"The disease caused by the new type of coronavirus, the Covid-19, has posed major public health challenges for many countries. With its rapid spread, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2019, the disease transmitted by SARS-Cov2 has already caused over 400 thousand deaths to date. The diagnosis of the disease has an important role in combating Covid-19. Proposed method In this work, we propose a web system, Heg.IA, which seeks to optimize the diagnosis of Covid-19 through the use of artificial intelligence. The main ideia is that healthcare professionals can insert 41 hematological parameters from common blood tests and arterial gasometry into the system. Then, Heg.IA will provide a diagnostic report. It will indicate if the patient is infected with SARS-Cov2 virus, and also predict the type of hospitalization (regular ward, semi-ICU, or ICU). We developed a web system called Heg.IA to support decision-making regarding to diagnosis of Covid-19 and to the indication of hospitalization on regular ward, semi-ICU or ICU. This application is based on decision trees in a Random Forest architecture with 90 trees. The system showed to be highly efficient, with great results for both Covid-19 diagnosis and to recommend hospitalization. For the first scenario we found average results of accuracy of 92.891% {+\/-} 0.851, kappa index of 0.858 {+\/-} 0.017, sensitivity of 0.936 {+\/-} 0.011, precision of 0.923 {+\/-} 0.011, specificity of 0.921 {+\/-} 0.012 and area under ROC of 0.984 {+\/-} 0.003. As for the indication of hospitalization, we achieved excellent performance of accuracies above 99% and more than 0.99 for the other metrics in all situations. By using a computationally simple method, based on the classical decision trees, we were able to achieve high diagnosis performance. Heg.IA system may be a way to overcome the testing unavailability in the context of Covid-19. We also expect the system will provide wide access to Covid-19 effective diagnosis and thereby reach and help saving lives.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Clarisse Lins de Lima","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Raquel Bezerra Calado","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Claudio Roberto Bertoldo Junior","author_inst":"REDERA Technologies"},{"author_name":"Jeniffer Emidio de Almeida Albuquerque","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Gomes de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Juarez Escorel de Araujo","author_inst":"Secretaria Municipal de Saude de Paudalho"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Emmanuel de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Anne Claire Reydel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Michel Kindo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Minh Hoang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Hess","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Chisato Sato","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Sophie Ohlmann","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Laurence Jesel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Olivier Morel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ohlmann","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard K\u00fcster","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Protzer","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roland Rad","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"John Ziebuhr","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen, Institute of Medical Virology, 35392 Giessen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland & Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pietro Scaturro","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mann","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Pichlmair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20129841","rel_title":"Field-deployable, rapid diagnostic testing of saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20129841","rel_abs":"Abstract Rapid, scalable, point-of-need, COVID-19 diagnostic testing is necessary to safely re-open economies and prevent future outbreaks.

Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage amongst HCWs at work is necessary to inform the development of HCW screening programmes to control nosocomial spread. Methods Cross-sectional snapshot survey from April-May 2020; HCWs recruited from six UK hospitals. Participants self-completed a health questionnaire and underwent a combined viral nose and throat swab, tested by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 with viral culture on majority of positive samples. Findings Point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage across the sites was 2.0% (23\/1152 participants), median cycle threshold value 35.70 (IQR:32.42-37.57). 17 were previously symptomatic, two currently symptomatic (isolated anosmia and sore throat); the remainder declared no prior or current symptoms. Symptoms in the past month were associated with threefold increased odds of testing positive (aOR 3.46, 95%CI 1.38-8.67; p=0.008). SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from only one (5%) of nineteen cultured samples. A large proportion (39%) of participants reported symptoms in the past month. Interpretation The point-prevalence is similar to previous estimates for HCWs in April 2020, though a magnitude higher than in the general population. Based upon interpretation of symptom history and testing results including viral culture, the majority of those testing positive were unlikely to be infectious at time of sampling. Development of screening programmes must balance the potential to identify additional cases based upon likely prevalence, expanding the symptoms list to encourage HCW testing, with resource implications and risks of excluding those unlikely to be infectious with positive tests.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Clare","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julie Andrews","author_inst":"Whittington Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Cressida Auckland","author_inst":"Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sarah Beshir","author_inst":"The Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth"},{"author_name":"Saher Choudhry","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust & University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Kerrie Davies","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jane Freeman","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust & University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Andrew Gallini","author_inst":"The Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth"},{"author_name":"Rachel Moores","author_inst":"The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Trupti Patel","author_inst":"Whittington Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Gosia Poznalska","author_inst":"Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alison Rodger","author_inst":"The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust & Institute for Global Health, UCL London"},{"author_name":"Stella Roberts","author_inst":"Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rooney","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust & University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mark Wilcox","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust & University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Simon Warren","author_inst":"The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust & The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"Public Health England & The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"John Ziebuhr","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen, Institute of Medical Virology, 35392 Giessen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland & Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pietro Scaturro","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mann","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Pichlmair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20127605","rel_title":"Longitudinal immune profiling reveals distinct features of COVID-19 pathogenesis","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20127605","rel_abs":"Background The pathogenesis of COVID-19, caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), involves a complex host-virus interaction and is characterised by an exaggerated immune response, the specific components of which are poorly understood. Here we report the outcome of a longitudinal immune profiling study in hospitalised patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and show the relationship between immune responses and severity of the clinical presentation. Methods The Coronavirus Immune Response and Clinical Outcomes (CIRCO) study was conducted at four hospitals in Greater Manchester. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, recruited as close to admission as possible, provided peripheral blood samples at enrolment and sequentially thereafter. Fresh samples were assessed for immune cells and proteins in whole blood and serum. Some samples were also stimulated for 3 hours with LPS and analysed for intracellular proteins. Results were stratified based on patient-level data including severity of symptoms and date of reported symptom onset. Findings Longitudinal analysis showed a very high neutrophil to T cell ratio and abnormal activation of monocytes in the blood, which displayed high levels of the cell cycle marker, Ki67 and low COX-2. These properties all reverted in patient with good outcome. Unexpectedly, multiple aspects of inflammation were diminished as patients progressed in severity and time, even in ITU patients not recovering. Interpretation This is the first detailed longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 patients of varying severity and outcome, revealing common features and aspects that track with severity. Patients destined for a severe outcome can be identified at admission when still displaying mild-moderate symptoms.

Epidemiological analysis and contact tracing together with a thorough investigation of virus variant patterns revealed low and high infection dose transmissions to be involved in transmission events. Methods: Infection control measures were applied to follow up contract tracing. Metagenomic RNA- and SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing was performed from 25 clinical samples for sequence analysis and variant calling. Results: The index patient acquired SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and after his return to Hamburg transmitted it to 2 out of 132 contacts. Virus genomics and variant pattern clearly confirms the initial local cluster. We identify frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 241, 3037, 14408, 23403 and 28881 previously described in Italian sequences and now considered as one major genotype in Europe. While the index patient showed a single nucleotide polymorphism only one variant was transmitted to the recipients. Different to the initial cluster, we observed in household clusters occurring at the time in Hamburg also intra-host viral species transmission events. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 variant tracing highlights both, low infection dose transmissions suggestive of fomites as route of infection in the initial cluster and high and low infection dose transmissions in family clusters indicative of fomites and droplets as infection routes. This suggests (1) single viral particle infection can be sufficient to initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) household\/family members are exposed to high virus loads and therefore have a high risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Susanne Pfefferle","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Thomas Guenther","author_inst":"Heinrich-Pette Institute, Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Robin Kobbe","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Manja Czech-Sioli","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Dominik Noerz","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Rene Santer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Jun Oh","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Stefan Kluge","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Lisa Oestereich","author_inst":"Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Kersten Peldschus","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Daniela Indenbirken","author_inst":"Heinrich-Pette Institute, Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Jiabin Huang","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Adam Grundhoff","author_inst":"Heinrich-Pette Institute, Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Martin Aepfelbacher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Johannes Knobloch","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Marc luetgehetmann","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Nicole Fischer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"- CIRCO","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"John Grainger","author_inst":"Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Tracy Hussell","author_inst":"Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"Public Health England & The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"John Ziebuhr","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen, Institute of Medical Virology, 35392 Giessen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland & Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pietro Scaturro","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mann","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Pichlmair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20130005","rel_title":"Modeling the Spring 2020 New York City COVID-19 Epidemic: New Criteria and Methods for Prediction","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20130005","rel_abs":"We report here on results obtained using the SIR model to study the spring 2020 COVID-19 epidemic in New York City.

Objectives were to compare anxiety and depression symptoms among people with a pre-existing medical condition, the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), including continuous change scores, proportion with change [&ge;] 1 minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and factors associated with changes, including country. Methods: Pre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were linked to COVID-19 data collected April 9 to April 27, 2020. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale (MCID = 4 points) and depression symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (MCID = 3 points). Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with continuous change and change [&ge;] 1 MCID. Findings: Among 435 participants (Canada = 98; France = 159; United Kingdom = 50; United States = 128), mean anxiety symptoms increased 4.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0 to 5.7). Depression symptom change was negligible (0.3 points; 95% CI -0.7 to 0.2). Compared to France, adjusted scores from the United States and United Kingdom were 3.8 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.9) and 2.9 points higher (95% CI 0.0 to 5.7); scores for Canada were not significantly different. Odds of increasing by [&ge;] 1 MCID were twice as high for the United Kingdom (2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.2) and United States (1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2). Participants who used mental health services pre-COVID had adjusted increases 3.7 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.7) less than other participants. Interpretation: Anxiety symptoms, but not depression symptoms, increased dramatically during COVID-19 among people with a pre-existing medical condition. Increase was larger in the United Kingdom and United States than in Canada and France but substantially less for people with pre-COVID-19 mental health treatment.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brett D.
