Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis using inverse variance random effect models including all studies that evaluate the role of ACEIs\/ARBs and reported adjusted odds ratio. Results: Nine studies met our eligibility criteria that enrolled a population of 58615 patients infected with SASR-CoV-2. Prior use of ACEIs\/ARBs were associated with significant reduction of inpatient mortality among infected patients with SASR-CoV-2, adjusted odds ratio from 4 studies 0.33, 95% confidence interval ( 0.22,0.49) with zero in between studies heterogeneity and with significant reduction of critical or fatal outcome , pooled adjusted odds ratio from 5 studies 0.32,95% confidence interval ( 0.22,0.46) with no in between studies heterogeneity. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that prior use ACEIs \/ARBs is associated with a decreased risk of death or critical outcome among SASR-CoV-2 infected patients.This findings is limited by the observational nature of included studies.However, it provides a reassurance to the public not to stop prescribed ACEIs \/ARBs due to fear of severe COVID-19. It also calls upon investigators and ethics committee to reconsider the ongoing randomized trials of discontinuation of these drugs.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aref A.

While it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8\/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n=172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n=94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 +\/- 7031 ng\/ml, n=32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 +\/- 3146, p<0.0001). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, implicating neutrophils as potential perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hui Shi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yu Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Srilakshmi Yalavarthi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Gockman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Melanie Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A.

Viral detection using RT-qPCR has been among the most important factors helping to control local spread of SARS-CoV-2 and it is considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis. Nevertheless, the RNA extraction step is both laborious and expensive, thus hampering the diagnosis in many places where there are not laboratory staff of funds enough to contribute for diagnosis efforts. Thus, the need to simplify procedures, reduce costs of the techniques used, and expand the capacity of the number of diagnostics of COVID-19 is imperative. In this study, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of RNA extraction has been successfully achieved through pre-treatment of the clinical sample with Proteinase K. The results show that only the use of proteinase K, without the need to perform the whole standard protocol for sample extraction and purification, can be an efficient technique for the diagnosis of COVID-19, since 91% of the samples matched the results with the standard procedure, with an average increase of 5.64 CT in the RT-qPCR.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Larissa Mallmann","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Karoline Schallenberger","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Meriane Demoliner","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Ana Karolina Antunes Eisen","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Bruna Saraiva Hermann","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Fagner Henrique Heldt","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Alana Witt Hansen","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Fernando R Spilki","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Juliane Deise Fleck","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Njira L.

Among adult organs, enterocytes and goblet cells of the small intestine and colon, kidney proximal tubule cells, and gallbladder basal cells appear most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with clinical data. Our analysis also suggests alternate entry paths for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung, central nervous system, and heart. We predict spermatogonial cells and prostate endocrine cells, but not ovarian cells, to be highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting male-specific vulnerabilities. Early stages of embryonic and placental development show a moderate risk of infection. The nasal epithelium looks like another battleground, characterized by high expression of both promoting and restricting factors and a potential age-dependent shift in SCARF expression. Lastly, SCARF expression appears broadly conserved across human, chimpanzee and macaque organs examined.

This systematic review included all clinical trials on pharmacological therapy related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP) up to April 22, 2020. Clinical trials characteristics (country, design, sample size, main outcomes, expected completion data, type of participants, length of the interventions, main outcomes). How many trials and the accumulated sample size by drug or combination of drugs, and by month in 2020 was depicted. We identified 412 clinical trials registers addressing the effect of pharmacological treatments on COVID-19, predominantly from Asia and Europe (42.2% and 31.1% of clinical trials registers, respectively). The most main outcomes studied were clinical recovery (54.4% of the clinical trials registers, respiratory recovery (28.2%) mortality (27.4%), viral load\/negativity (20.4%). During 2020, a huge amount of clinical trials are expected to be completed: 41 trials (60,366 participants) using hydroxychloroquine, 20 trials (1,588 participants) using plasma, 18 trials (6,830 participants) using chloroquine, 12 trials (9,938 participants using lopinavir\/ritonavir, 11 trials (1,250 participants) using favipiravir, 10 trials ( 2,175 participants) using tocilizumab and 6 trials (13,540 participants) using Remdesivir. The distribution of the number of registered clinical trials among the different therapeutic options leads to an excess of sample size for some and a lack for others. Our data allow us to conclude that by the end of June we will have results of almost 20 trials involving 40000 patients for hydroxychloroquine and 5 trials with 4500 patients for remdesivir; however, low statistical power is expected from the 9 clinical trials testing the efficacy of favipiravir or the 5 testing tocilizumab, since they will recruit less than 1000 patients each one.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vicente Martinez-Vizcaino","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Arthur E Mesas","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Ivan Cavero-Redondo","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Alicia Saz-Lara","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Irene Sequi-Dominguez","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Carlos Pascual-Morena","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Celia Alvarez-Bueno","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Fernando R Spilki","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Juliane Deise Fleck","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Njira L.

As of 1st May 2020, the Italian health authorities reported 28,238 deaths nationally. To control the epidemic, the Italian government implemented a suite of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including school and university closures, social distancing and full lockdown involving banning of public gatherings and non essential movement. In this report, we model the effect of NPIs on transmission using data on average mobility. We estimate that the average reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) is currently below one for all Italian regions, and significantly so for the majority of the regions. Despite the large number of deaths, the proportion of population that has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 (the attack rate) is far from the herd immunity threshold in all Italian regions, with the highest attack rate observed in Lombardy (13.18% [10.66%-16.70%]). Italy is set to relax the currently implemented NPIs from 4th May 2020. Given the control achieved by NPIs, we consider three scenarios for the next 8 weeks: a scenario in which mobility remains the same as during the lockdown, a scenario in which mobility returns to pre-lockdown levels by 20%, and a scenario in which mobility returns to pre-lockdown levels by 40%. The scenarios explored assume that mobility is scaled evenly across all dimensions, that behaviour stays the same as before NPIs were implemented, that no pharmaceutical interventions are introduced, and it does not include transmission reduction from contact tracing, testing and the isolation of confirmed or suspected cases. New interventions, such as enhanced testing and contact tracing are going to be introduced and will likely contribute to reductions in transmission; therefore our estimates should be viewed as pessimistic projections. We find that, in the absence of additional interventions, even a 20% return to pre-lockdown mobility could lead to a resurgence in the number of deaths far greater than experienced in the current wave in several regions. Future increases in the number of deaths will lag behind the increase in transmission intensity and so a second wave will not be immediately apparent from just monitoring of the daily number of deaths. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as mobility should be closely monitored in the next weeks and months. To compensate for the increase in mobility that will occur due to the relaxation of the currently implemented NPIs, adherence to the recommended social distancing measures alongside enhanced community surveillance including swab testing, contact tracing and the early isolation of infections are of paramount importance to reduce the risk of resurgence in transmission.","rel_num_authors":63,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michaela A.

was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China has spread all over the world causing startling loss of lives, stalling the global economy and disrupting the social life. One of the challenges to contain the COVID-19 is making people adopt personal hygiene, social distancing and self-quarantine practices which are all related to knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of the people in respective countries. Bangladesh, the most densely populated countries with a fast-growing economy and moderate literacy rate, has shown many hiccups in its efforts to implement COVID-19 policies. Understanding KAP may give the policy makers to make informed decisions. Hence, this study aimed to make a quick assessment of KAP of people in relation to COVID-19 in Bangladesh. An online survey using a pre-tested questionnaire conducted in late March 2020 attained 1837 responses across Bangladesh. However, 1589 completed responses were included in statistical analysis to calculate KAP scores, their interrelations with socio-demographic variables. The overall KAP is poor with only 10% of the respondents showed good knowledge with parallel attitudes and practices. Socio-demographic factors have strong bearings on the KAP scores. Significantly higher KAP score is evident in female over male respondents, among aged (45 years and above) over younger respondents and among retired and homemakers above students and public service holders. The study indicated a panic fuelled by poor understanding of COVID-19 associated facts and the need for the government to ensure more granular and targeted awareness campaigns in a transparent and factual manner to gain public confidence and arrest more meaningful public participation in mitigation measures. The study provides a baseline of KAP among people in Bangladesh on COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alak Paul","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Dwaipayan Sikdar","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mosharraf Hossain","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Md Robed Amin","author_inst":"Dhaka Medical College"},{"author_name":"Farah Deeba","author_inst":"University of Dhaka"},{"author_name":"Janardan Mahanta","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Md.

We evaluated the impact of small-area lockdowns in Chile, aimed to reduce viral transmission while minimizing the population disrupted. The effectiveness of this intervention on the outbreak control is unknown. Methods A natural experiment assessing the impact of small-area lockdowns between February 15th and April 25th, 2020. We used mobility data and official governmental reports to compare regions with small-area lockdowns versus regions without. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the effective reproductive number (Re) of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were changes in mobility indicators. We used quasi-experimental methods for the analysis and examined the impact of other concurrent public health interventions to disentangle their effects. Results Small-area lockdown produced a sizable reduction in human mobility, equivalent to an 11.4% reduction (95%CI -14.4% to -8.38%) in public transport and similar effects in other mobility indicators. Ten days after implementation, the small-area lockdown produced a reduction of the effective reproductive number (Re) of 0.86 (95%CI -1.70 to -0.02). School and university closures, implemented earlier, led to a 40% reduction in urban mobility. Closure of educational institutions resulted in an even greater Re reduction compared with small-area lockdowns. Conclusions Small-area lockdowns produced a reduction in mobility and viral transmission, but the effects were smaller than the early closures of schools and universities. Small-area lockdowns may have a relevant supporting role in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and could be useful for countries considering scaling-down stricter social distancing interventions.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Crist\u00f3bal Cuadrado","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Monsalves","author_inst":"Universidad San Sebastian"},{"author_name":"Jean Gajardo","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Paz Bertoglia","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Manuel Najera","author_inst":"Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Tania Alfaro","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Canals","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Jay Kaufmann","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Sebasti\u00e1n Pe\u00f1a","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Lejla Hrusti\u0107","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Zainab Ashraf","author_inst":"Faculty of Arts, University of Waterloo, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sarvin Es haghi","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Luis Rodr\u00edguez-Pino","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Verena Waller","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Jabeen","author_inst":"Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"A.

A number of measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population. However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires an appropriate and sufficient knowledge. Thus, a survey was conducted with the aim of assessing the awareness, knowledge, attitude and practices towards measures for prevention of the spread of Covid-19 amongst Ugandans. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted during the lockdown in Uganda. An online questionnaire and a snowballing approach was used for participant recruitment of 18 years above literate Ugandans. Data collection was done from 6th to 15th April 2020 during which 1763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests. Results Out of 1763 participants, 97.6% were aware of the current pandemic. 83.9% of participants had a good knowledge score (21.8\/27), 72.4% had a good attitude and 85.3% were practicing measures to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus disease. The ordered logistic regression showed that being a Health worker was significantly associated with a high knowledge (aOR:6 (3.32-10.93); a good attitude (aOR:2.5(1.68-3.8)]) and good practice (aOR:2.9 (1.95-4.2). On contrary, being a driver, business entrepreneur and a security personnel were found to have less rate in awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice. Conclusions Ugandans had a good overall awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice. However, there is still a gap of knowledge, attitude and practice among drivers, business entrepreneur and security personnel. There is a need to mobilize the population in the country to have the same degree of awareness and knowledge which will have an impact on attitude and practice to prevent spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robinson Ssebuufu","author_inst":"Kampala International University Western Campus"},{"author_name":"Franck Sikakulya","author_inst":"kampala international university western campus"},{"author_name":"Simon Mambo Binezero","author_inst":"Kampala International University Western Campus"},{"author_name":"Lucien Wasingya","author_inst":"Kitovu Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sifa K.

Electronic cigarette use (vaping) rapidly gained popularity in the US in recent years. Whether electronic cigarette users (vapers) are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection is unknown. Methods Using integrated data in each US state from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), United States Census Bureau and the 1Point3Acres.com website, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with negative binomial distribution assumption and log link functions were used to examine the association of weighted proportions of vapers with number of COVID-19 infections and deaths in the US. Results The weighted proportion of vapers who used e-cigarettes every day or some days ranged from 2.86% to 6.42% for US states. Statistically significant associations were observed between the weighted proportion of vapers and number of COVID-19 infected cases as well as COVID-19 deaths in the US after adjusting for the weighted proportion of smokers and other significant covariates in the GEE models. With every one percent increase in weighted proportion of vapers in each state, the number of COVID-19 infected cases increase by 0.3139 (95% CI: 0.0554 - 0.5723) and the number of COVID-19 deaths increase by 0.3705 (95% CI: 0.0623 - 0.6786) in log scale in each US state. Conclusions The positive associations between the proportion of vapers and the number of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths in each US state suggest an increased susceptibility of vapers to COVID-19 infections and deaths.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical & Translational Research, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel P.

This will lead to negative impacts in many sectors. Saudi Arabia not only plays an important role on the economical side because it is the leading country in oil production, but also because it is considered the heart of the Islamic countries. Although protective measures have been implemented in Saudi Arabia, the number of COVID-19 cases has increased. Aims of the study: This study aimed to employ SIR model to forecast the peak of COVID-19 progression and an estimation of it is end in Saudi Arabia. Method: Based on the World Health Organization data on COVID-19 progression in Saudi Arabia from March 3rd to April 29th, 2020, we reliably estimate the constant parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and potential ending time. Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered are the main components of the SIR model that were used to run the analysis. Result: The data showed an interesting result about the peak of the disease progression. It is projected to occur around the 20th day after running the model. According to the model, the peak time will be around the 20th of May. Then the cases will decrease until the 55th day, which is around June 20th. Conclusion: The result predicts a second peak and an estimation end of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. This data can inform the policy makers, who should try to contain the virus, to be prepared for what is coming next.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"haitham khoj","author_inst":"Knig Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Alaa F Mujallad","author_inst":"University of Jeddah"},{"author_name":"Deborah J.

Using published data, we explored the predictive role of basic demographics such as age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities in order to establish an objective risk stratification tool that could help risk allocate duties to health care workers. We developed an objective risk stratification tool using a Caucasian female <50years of age with no comorbidities as a reference. Each point allocated to risk factors was associated with an approximate doubling in risk. This tool was then validated against the primary care-based analysis. This tool provides objective support for employers when determining which healthcare workers should be allocated to high-risk vs. lower risk patient facing clinical duties or to remote supportive roles.;","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janusz Jankowski","author_inst":"1.\tSherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Nottinghamshire"},{"author_name":"Angharad davies","author_inst":"Swansea University Medical School, Swansea"},{"author_name":"Peter English","author_inst":"Public Health Medicine Committee, British Medical Association, London"},{"author_name":"Ellis Friedman","author_inst":"Faculty of Public Health, UK"},{"author_name":"Helena McKeown","author_inst":"British Medical Association"},{"author_name":"Mala Rao","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Su Sethi","author_inst":"North West Commissioning Team"},{"author_name":"W David Strain","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Sebasti\u00e1n Pe\u00f1a","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Lejla Hrusti\u0107","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Zainab Ashraf","author_inst":"Faculty of Arts, University of Waterloo, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sarvin Es haghi","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Luis Rodr\u00edguez-Pino","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Verena Waller","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Jabeen","author_inst":"Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"A.

For SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19, data on clinical onset serial intervals is limited, since symptom onset dates are not routinely recorded and do not exist in asymptomatic carriers. METHODS We define the diagnostic serial interval as the time between the diagnosis dates of the infector and infectee. Based on the DS4C project data on SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19 in South Korea, we estimate the means of the diagnostic serial interval, the clinical onset serial interval and the difference between the two. We use the balanced cluster bootstrap method to construct 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. RESULTS The mean of the diagnostic serial interval was estimated to be 3.63 days (95% CI: 3.24, 4.01). The diagnostic serial interval was shown to be significantly shorter than the clinical onset serial interval (estimated mean difference -1.12 days, 95% CI: -1.98, -0.26). CONCLUSIONS The relatively short diagnostic serial intervals of SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19 in South Korea are likely due to the country's extensive efforts towards contact tracing. We suggest the mean diagnostic serial interval as a new indicator for the effectiveness of a country's contact tracing as part of the epidemic surveillance.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sofia Kyonhi Mettler","author_inst":"1.

Methods: We collected dates of patients from Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Jinhua city and so on who had the clear exposure history of a novel coronavirus pneumonia(COVID-19). We retrospected demographic data, exposure time, onset time, visiting time and positive time for novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection in respiratory specimens. There were 256 patients from January 20, 2020-February 12,2020 from eight cities included in our study. 106 cases appeared symptoms before January 25th and 150 after. Results: There were 136(53.1%)male infected cases. The mean age of all patients was 43.80 {+\/-} 14.85.The median time from exposure to onset was 5(3,8)days.The median time of the first time of positive nucleic acid detection was 11(9,14)days and mode number was 13.The median time from onset to the first time of positive nucleic acid detection was 6(4,8)days and mode number was 5. The time from onset to definite diagnosis was 5(3,7) days before January 25th while it was 7.5(5,10)days after which was significantly shorter before January 25th(U=3885.5,P<0.001). The time from exposure to definite diagnosis was 11(9,14)days and 11(9,14)days before January 25th and after and without significant difference. The time from exposure to definite diagnosis was 11(9,13)days in first-tier cities and 13(11,15)days in second and third-tier cities. The difference was significantly shorter of first-tier cities(U=1355.5 P=0.039). And also the time was short from visiting to definite diagnosis which was 2(2,3)days in first-tier cities and 3(2,4)days in second and third-tier cities but without significant difference(U=842.5P=0.054). Conclusions: From our study we found that the best upper respiratory tract sampling time for novel coronavirus pneumonia suspects was 13days after exposure. The time from onset to definite diagnosis was shorter after January 25th. The patients were diagnosed faster in the first-tier cities after exposure.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Zhou","author_inst":"Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Lin Chen","author_inst":"Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Dehe Zhang","author_inst":"Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Haijun Chen","author_inst":"Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Qiyue Sheng","author_inst":"Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hongsheng Deng","author_inst":"Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Shunlan Ni","author_inst":"Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Shengnan Luo","author_inst":"Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Binbin Ren","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Jinhua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zainab Ashraf","author_inst":"Faculty of Arts, University of Waterloo, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sarvin Es haghi","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Luis Rodr\u00edguez-Pino","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Verena Waller","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Jabeen","author_inst":"Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"A.

Predicting the disease severity at time of diagnosis can be helpful in prioritizing hospital admission and resources. Methods We prospectively recruited 1096 consecutive patients with COVID19 from the Jaber Hospital, a COVID19 facility in Kuwait, between 24 February and 20 April 2020. The primary endpoint of interest was disease severity defined algorithmically. Predefined risk variables were collected at the time of PCR based diagnosis of the infection. Prognostic model development used 5-fold cross-validated regularized logit regression. The cohort was divided into a training and validation cohort and all model development proceeded on the training cohort. Results There were 643 patients with clinical course data of whom 94 developed severe COVID19. In the final model, age, CRP, procalcitonin, lymphocyte and monocyte percentages and serum albumin were independent predictors of a more severe illness course. The final prognostic model demonstrated good discrimination, calibration and internal validity.

The disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. The admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of COVID-19 include severe hypoxia, low platelet count, elevated bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate. These symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases. The diseases also share similar co-morbidity risks including dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hypertension and chronic renal failure. Sepsis has been observed in up to 59% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapy\/drug repurposing avenues for late-stage severe COVID-19 patients. This would enable better protection of at-risk populations and clinical stratification of COVID-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease. METHODS As there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed COVID-19 patients correlating their genomic profile, disease severity and outcome, co-morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors (such as ethnicity, blood group, smoking, BMI etc.), a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible. We therefore ran a study on the UK Biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes, and correlated these with COVID-19 patients. Sepsis is itself a life-threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20%. Like the initial studies for COVID-19 patients, standard genome wide association studies (GWAS) have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis. RESULTS We used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from UK Biobank. We identified 70 sepsis risk-associated genes, which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis. Many of these targets can be grouped by common mechanisms of action such as endothelial cell dysfunction, PI3K\/mTOR pathway signaling, immune response regulation, aberrant GABA and neurogenic signaling. CONCLUSION This study has identified 70 sepsis related genes, many of them for the first time, that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe COVID-19 patients. We have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sayoni Das","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Krystyna Taylor","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Matthew Pearson","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"James Kozubek","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Marcin Pawlowski","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Claus Erik Jensen","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Skowron","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Gert Lykke M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mark Strivens","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Laura Jantsch Ferla","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maria Eduarda Santos Puga","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Virginia Fernandes Moca Trevisani","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Universidade Santo Amaro"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Cochrane Brazil"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Jabeen","author_inst":"Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"A.

However, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r2 = 0.88; p = 8 X 10-7), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no-association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis E Escobar","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Molina-Cruz","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Carolina Barillas-Mury","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"James Kozubek","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Marcin Pawlowski","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Claus Erik Jensen","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Skowron","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Gert Lykke M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mark Strivens","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Laura Jantsch Ferla","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maria Eduarda Santos Puga","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Virginia Fernandes Moca Trevisani","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Universidade Santo Amaro"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Cochrane Brazil"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Jabeen","author_inst":"Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"A.

Methods: A total of 419 patients were enrolled including 19 confirmed cases and 400 patients from fever clinics. Their serial serum samples collected during the hospitalization were menstruated for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using gold immunochromatographic assay and chemiluminescence immunoassay. We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of antibody detection. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress and false positive factors for antibody testing were also analyzed. Results: The positive rate of IgG detection was 91.67% and 83.33% using two CLIA, respectively. However, the IgM positive rate was dramatically declined might due to the lack of blood samples at early stages of the disease. The chemiluminescence immunoassay had a favorable but narrow linear range. Our work showed increased IgG values in serums from virus-negative patients and four negative samples were IgG weak-positive after thermal incubation. Our data showed the specificity of viral N+S proteins was higher than single antigen. Unlike generally thought that IgM appeared earlier than IgG, there is no certain chronological order of IgM and IgG seroconversion in COVID-19 patients. It was difficult to detect antibodies in asymptomatic patients suggesting that their low viral loads were not enough to cause immune response. Analysis of common interferent in three IgG false-positive patients, such as rheumatoid factor, proved that false positives were not caused by these interfering substances and antigenic cross-reaction. Conclusions: Viral serological test is an effective means for SARS-CoV-2 infect detection using both chemiluminescence immunoassay and gold immunochromatographic assay. Chemiluminescence immunoassay against multi-antigens has obvious advantages but still need improve in reducing false positives.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quan Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Danping Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Huacheng Yan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Southern Theatre Comman"},{"author_name":"Jingwen Quan","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Zhenzhan Kuang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Weiyun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ling Huang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ting Lei","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Aiwu Luo","author_inst":"Department of disease control and prevention, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Sun","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Linhai Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Cochrane Brazil"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Jabeen","author_inst":"Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"A.

To determine if specific ethnic groups are at higher risk of mortality from COVID19 infection. Design. Retrospective cohort study Setting. University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) in Birmingham, UK Participants. Patients with confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection requiring admission to UHB between 10th March 2020 and 17th April 2020 Exposure. Ethnicity Main outcome measures. Standardised Admission Ratio (SAR) and Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) for each ethnicity was calculated using observed sex specific age distributions of COVID19 admissions and deaths and 2011 census data for Birmingham\/Solihull. Hazard Ratio (aHR) for mortality was estimated for each ethnic group with white population as reference group, using Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, social deprivation and co-morbidities, and propensity score matching. Results. 2217 patients admitted to UHB with a proven diagnosis of COVID19 were included. 58.2% were male, 69.5% White and the majority (80.2%) had co morbidities. 18.5% were of South Asian ethnicity, and these patients were more likely to be younger (median age 61 years vs.77 years), have no co morbidities (27.8% vs. 16.6%) but a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (48.0% vs 28.2%) than White patients. SAR and SMR suggested more admissions and deaths in South Asian patients than would be predicted. South Asian patients were also more likely to present with severe disease despite no delay in presentation since symptom onset. South Asian ethnicity was associated with an increased risk of death; both by Cox regression (Hazard Ratio 1.66 (95%CI 1.32 to 2.10)) after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation and comorbidities and by propensity score matching, (Hazard ratio 1.68 (1.33 to 2.13), using the same factors but categorising ethnicity into South Asian or not. Conclusions. Current evidence suggests those of South Asian ethnicity may be at risk of worse COVID19 outcomes, further studies need to establish the underlying mechanistic pathways.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth Sapey","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Suzy Gallier","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Mainey","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Peter Nightingale","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"David McNulty","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hannah Crothers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Felicity Evison","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Katharine Reeves","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Domenico Pagano","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alastair K Denniston","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Peter Diggle","author_inst":"University of Lancaster"},{"author_name":"Simon Ball","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Cochrane Brazil"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Jabeen","author_inst":"Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"A.

In order to control the pandemic, rapid tests for detecting existing infections and assessing virus spread are critical. Approaches to detect viral RNA based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) hold outstanding promise towards greatly simplified and broadly applicable testing methods. RT-LAMP assays appear more robust than qPCR-based methods and only require incubation at a constant temperature, thus eliminating the need for sophisticated instrumentation. Here, we tested a two-color RT-LAMP protocol using clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples and also established a protocol that does not require prior RNA isolation (\"swab-to-RT-LAMP\"). Our study is based on several hundred clinical patient samples with a wide range of viral loads, thus allowing, for the first time, to accurately determine the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. We found that RT-LAMP can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 samples with a qPCR threshold cycle number (CT value) of up to 30 in the standard RT-qPCR assay. We used both, either purified RNA or direct pharyngeal swab specimens and showed that RT-LAMP assays have, despite a decreased sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, excellent specificity. We also developed a multiplexed LAMP-sequencing protocol as a validation and backup procedure to double-check the results of visual RT-LAMP assays.

Prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases. Methods We retrospectively studied the relationship between RDW and COVID19 mortality risk for 1198 adult patients diagnosed with SARS COV2 at 4 Partners Healthcare Network Hospitals between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Findings Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with increased mortality in patients of all ages with a risk ratio of 2.5 (95% CI, 2.3-2.8). Stratified by age, the risk ratio was 6.2 (4.4-7.9, N = 312) < 50 years, 3.2 (2.5-4.1, N = 230) 50-60, 2.3 (1.6-3.1, N = 236) 60-70, 1.2 (0.7-1.8, N = 203) 70-80, and 1.9 (1.5-2.3, N = 216) > 80 years. RDW was significantly associated with mortality in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-Dimer, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities (p < 1e-4 for RDW in all cases). Patients whose RDW increased during admission had a ~3-fold elevation in mortality risk compared to those whose RDW did not change. Interpretation Elevated RDW at diagnosis and an increase in RDW during admission are both associated with increased mortality risk for adult COVID19 patients at a large academic medical center network.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brody H Foy","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonathan CT Carlson","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Erik Reinertsen","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Raimon Padros Valls","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Roger Pallares Lopez","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eric Palanques-Tost","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mow","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Partners Healthcare"},{"author_name":"M Brandon Westover","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aaron D Aguirre","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"John M Higgins","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petr Chandla","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dina Khalid","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabel Barreto Miranda","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paul Schnitzler","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Kraeusslich","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Knop","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Simon Anders","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Dana Shibli","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Jordan, Jordan"},{"author_name":"Zofia Bara\u0144czuk Turska","author_inst":"Methods of Plasticity Research, Department of Psychology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Zeeshan Haq","author_inst":"Texas Behavioral Health, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Salah U Qureshi","author_inst":"Texas Behavioral Health, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Adriana M.

The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionately. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Results: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg\/m2. The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI <25 kg\/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25-34 kg\/m2: 17.2%, BMI[&ge;]35 kg\/m2: 34.8%, p= 0.03). The multivariate analysis for mortality, demonstrates that BMI[&ge;]35 kg\/m2 (OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.45 - 9.83; p=0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25 - 5.98; p=0.011) and increasing age (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13 - 2.63; p=0.011) were independently associated with higher inhospital mortality. Similar results were obtained for the outcomes of increasing oxygen requirement and intubation. Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonidas Palaiodimos","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Damianos G.

We first consider the no-cost scenario and analytically determine the optimal control and solution. We then study solutions when a cost of intervention is included, as well as a cost associated with overwhelming the available medical resources. Examples are studied through the numerical solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

US-based descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 infections have, for the most part, focused on patient populations with severe disease, captured in areas with limited testing capacity. The objective of this study is to compare characteristics of positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients, in a population primarily comprised of mild and moderate infections, identified from comprehensive population-level testing. Here, we extracted demographics, comorbidities, and vital signs from 20,088 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Utah Health clinics, in Salt Lake County, Utah; and for a subset of tested patients, we performed manual chart review to examine symptoms and exposure risks. To determine risk factors for testing positive, we used logistic regression to calculate the odds of testing positive, adjusting for symptoms and prior exposure. Of the 20,088 individuals, 1,229 (6.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found that Non-White persons were more likely to test positive compared to non-Hispanic Whites (adjOR=1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.6), and that this increased risk is more pronounced among Hispanic or Latino persons (adjOR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 3.1). However, we did not find differences in the duration of symptoms nor type of symptom presentation between non-Hispanic White and non-White individuals. We found that risk of hospitalization increases with age (adjOR=6.9 95% CI: 2.1, 22.5 for age 60+ compared to 0-19), and additionally show that younger individuals (aged 0-19), were underrepresented both in overall rates of testing as well as rates of testing positive. We did not find major race\/ethnic differences in hospitalization rates. In this analysis of predominantly non-hospitalized individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, enabled by expansive testing capacity, we found disparities in both testing and SARS-CoV-2 infection status by race\/ethnicity and by age. Further work on addressing racial and ethnic disparities, particularly among Hispanic\/Latino communities (where SARS-CoV-2 may be spreading more rapidly due to increased exposure and comparatively reduced testing), will be needed to effectively combat COVID-19 in the US.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sharia M Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Rashmee U Shah","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Margaret Bale","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Jordan B Peacock","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Ben Berger","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Brown","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Mann","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"William West","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Martin","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Fernandez","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Grineski","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Brintz","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew H.

Two parameters were estimated and evaluated for the cases registered in Rondenia, Brazil, between March 20 and April 22. The basic reproduction rate did not remain constant during the period, showing eventual variations due to social behavior. The results show that an increase in the proportion of testing to about 56% provided a significant decrease in confirmed cases, for the expansion of tested cases beyond the current testing criterion (20%) would help to identify and isolate also mild and moderate cases, generally referred to as asymptomatic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tito Dias Junior","author_inst":"Federal Police of Brazil"},{"author_name":"Camila Bueno Machado","author_inst":"Asa Norte Regional Hospital, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Margaret Bale","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Jordan B Peacock","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Ben Berger","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Brown","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Mann","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"William West","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Martin","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Fernandez","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Grineski","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Brintz","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew H.
