SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic carriage to life threatening pneumonia and cytokine dysregulation [1-3]. Although antibodies have been shown in a variety of in vitro assays to promote coronavirus infections through mechanisms requiring interactions between IgG antibodies and Fc gamma receptors (Fc{gamma}Rs), the relevance of these observations to coronavirus infections in humans is not known [4-7]. In light of ongoing clinical trials examining convalescent serum therapy for COVID-19 patients and expedited SARS-CoV-2 vaccine testing in humans, it is essential to clarify the role of antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here we show that adults with PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 produce IgG antibodies with a specific Fc domain repertoire that is characterized by reduced fucosylation, a modification that enhances interactions with the activating Fc{gamma}R, Fc{gamma}RIIIa. Fc fucosylation was reduced when compared with SARS-CoV-2-seropositive children and relative to adults with symptomatic influenza virus infections. These results demonstrate an antibody correlate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults and have implications for novel therapeutic strategies targeting Fc{gamma}RIIIa pathways.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saborni Chakraborty","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Karlie Edwards","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Anthony S.

However, additional studies are required to facilitate interpretation of results, including how antibody levels impact immunity and disease course. Methods: In this study, a total of 968 subjects were tested for IgG antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2. We confirmed analytic specificity using 656 plasma samples from healthy donors, 49 sera from patients with rheumatic disease, and 90 specimens from individuals positive for PCR-based respiratory viral panel. One-hundred seventy-three cases of confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 were tested for IgG. A subgroup of 37 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases was tested for nucleocapsid-specific IgM antibody using an in-house developed microarray method. Antibody levels were compared between disease severity groups. Results: All specificity specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (0\/656, 0%). Cross reactivity was not detected in specimens with antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor, or cases with previous diagnosis of viral infection including human coronavirus. Positive agreement of IgG with PCR was 83% of samples confirmed to be more than 14 days from symptom onset, with less than 100% sensitivity attributable to a case with severe immunosuppression. Virus-specific IgM was positive in a higher proportion of cases less than 3 days from symptom onset. No association was observed between mild and severe disease course with respect to IgG and IgM levels. Conclusions: The studied SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay had 100% specificity and no adverse cross-reactivity. Index values of IgG and IgM antibodies did not predict disease severity in our patient population.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William S.

This situation can create deadlocks in places where there is a discrepancy among municipal, state and federal policies. The exponential increase of the number of infectious people and deaths in the last days shows that the COVID-19 epidemics is still at its early stage in Brazil and such political disarray can lead to very serious results. In this work, we study the COVID-19 epidemics in Brazilian cities using early-time approximations of the SIR model in networks. Different from other works, the underlying network is constructed by feeding real-world data on local COVID-19 cases reported by Brazilian cities to a regularized vector autoregressive model, which estimates directional COVID-19 transmission channels (links) of every pair of cities (vertices) using spectral network analysis. Our results reveal that social isolation and, especially, the use of masks can effectively reduce the transmission rate of COVID-19 in Brazil. We also build counterfactual scenarios to measure the human impact of these public health measures in terms of reducing the number of COVID-19 cases at the epidemics peak. We find that the efficiency of social isolation and of using of masks differs significantly across cities. For instance, we find that they would potentially decrease the COVID-19 epidemics peak in Sao Paulo (SP) and Brasilia (DF) by 15% and 25%, respectively. We hope our study can support the design of further public health measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thiago Christiano Silva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Leandro Anghinoni","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Lenin Mahimainathan","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Ellen Araj","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"John Markantonis","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Chantale Lacelle","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Jyoti Balani","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Hiren Parikh","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"E.

The NIOSH test certifying the N95 rating, however, poorly simulates aerosols in healthcare settings, limiting our understanding of the exposure risk for healthcare workers wearing these masks, especially reprocessed ones. We used experimental conditions that simulated the sizes, densities and airflow properties of infectious aerosols in healthcare settings. We analyzed the penetration and leakage of aerosols through pristine and reprocessed N95 respirators. Seven reprocessing methods were investigated. Our findings suggest that pristine and properly reprocessed N95 respirators effectively limit exposure to infectious aerosols, but that care must be taken to avoid the elucidated degradation mechanisms and limit noncompliant wear.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Z Chen","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Aldrich Ngan","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Niclas Manson","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Jason T Maynes","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Gregory H Borschel","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Ori D Rotstein","author_inst":"St. Michael's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Frank X Gu","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Hea-Woon Park","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation &  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital,  Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Wonjong Yang","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation &  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital,  Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Joonyoung Jang","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation &  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Min Ho An","author_inst":"So Ahn Public Health Center, Wando, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Ravi Sarode","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Alagarraju Muthukumar","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Catherine A.

Objective: to describe the effect of off-label intravenous use of Sarilumab in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia. Design: Observational clinical cohort study. Setting: Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS as Italian Covid reference center. Participants: Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory distress with PaO2\/FiO2 ratio<300 treated with Sarilumab between March 23rd - April 4th, 2020. Date of final follow-up was April 18, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: We describe the clinical outcomes of 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia treated with intravenous Sarilumab in terms of pulmonary function improvement or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate in medical wards setting and of live discharge rate in ICU treated patients as well as in terms of safety. Each patient received Sarilumab 400 mg administered intravenously on day 1, with eventual additional infusion based on clinical judgement, and was followed for at least 14 days, unless previously discharged or dead. No gluco-corticosteroids were used at baseline. Results: Of the 53 SARS-CoV-2pos patients receiving Sarilumab, 39 (73.6%) were treated in medical wards (66.7% with a single infusion) while 14 (26.4%) in ICU (92.6% with a second infusion). The median PaO2\/FiO2 of patients in the Medical Ward was 146(IQR:120-212) while the median PaO2\/FiO2 of patients in ICU was 112(IQR:100-141.5), respectively. Within the medical wards, 7(17.9%) required ICU admission, 4 of whom were re-admitted to the ward within 5-8 days. At 19 days median follow-up, 89.7% of medical inpatients significantly improved (46.1% after 24 hours, 61.5% after 3 days), 70.6% were discharged from the hospital and 85.7% no longer needed oxygen therapy. Within patients receiving Sarilumab in ICU, 64.2% were discharged from ICU to the ward and 35.8% were still alive at the last follow-up. Overall mortality rate was 5.7% after Sarilumab administration: 1(2.5%) patient died in the Medical Ward whilst 2(14.2%) patients died in ICU, respectively. Conclusions and relevance: IL6-R inhibition appears to be a potential treatment strategy for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and intravenous Sarilumab seems a promising treatment approach showing, in the short term, an important clinical benefit and good safety.","rel_num_authors":41,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisa Gremese","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Currently, there is limited clarity on the pharmacological treatments available for the novel coronavirus. We systematically identified the current evidence and ongoing research on the pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using PRISMA-ScR. Observational studies, including cohort studies and case series, as well as experimental studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs were searched electronically on April 7, 2020 and by hand on May 1, 2020. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases were searched along with seven trial registries. The inclusion criteria were patients with confirmed COVID-19 who received pharmacological therapies, including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, lopinavir\/ritonavir, remdesivir, tocilizumab, and favipiravir. Results: We identified 222 studies on pharmacological treatment of the novel coronavirus. We included 11 of these studies in this review, including the ones on hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (one cohort), lopinavir\/ritonavir (one RCT, three cohorts, and two case series), remdesivir (one RCT and one case series), tocilizumab (one case series), and favipiravir (one RCT). In the three RCTs carried out in China, both lopinavir\/ritonavir and remdesivir did not show any significant earlier clinical improvement in case of severe infection [Hazard ratio (HR): 1.31, p=0.09 and HR: 1.24, p=0.24, respectively], The clinical recovery rate on day seven was not significantly different between the favipiravir and arbidol groups (p=0.14) for moderate patients, although the duration of pyrexia and cough in the favipiravir group was significantly shorter as compared to the arbidol group (p<0.01). There are 135 ongoing RCTs, including 72 for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, 29 for lopinavir\/ritonavir, 14 for remdesivir, 16 for tocilizumab, and 4 for favipiravir. Conclusion: The clinical effectiveness and safety of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear owing to the lack of large, high-quality RCTs. However, in the event of emerging infectious diseases, we need to repeatedly and systematically update the best available evidence to avoid misleading information.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noyuri Yamaji","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Sachiko Ohde","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Kimi Estela Kobayashi-Cuya","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Shota Saito","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Osamu Takahashi","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Simone Perniola","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Representative population-based data, including asymptomatic individuals for assessing the viral spread and immune response were, however, lacking worldwide. METHODS: Using a panel-based method, we implemented a representative sample of the Luxembourgish population based on age, gender and residency for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody status in order to define prevalence irrespective of clinical symptoms. Participants were contacted via email to fill an online questionnaire before biosampling at local laboratories. All participants provided information related to clinical symptoms, epidemiology, socioeconomic and psychological assessments and underwent biosampling, rRT-PCR testing and serology for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We included a total of 1862 individuals in our representative sample of the general Luxembourgish population. Of these, 5 individuals had a current positive result for infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on rRT-PCR. Four of these individuals were oligosymptomatic and one was asymptomatic. Overall we found a positive IgG antibody status in 35 individuals (1.97%), of which 11 reported to be tested positive by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 previously and showed in addition their IgG positive status also a positive status for IgA. Our data indicate a prevalence of 0.3% for active SARS-CoV-2 infection and an infection rate of 2.15% in the Luxembourgish population between 18 and 79 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Luxembourgish residents show a low rate of acute infections after 7 weeks of confinement and present with an antibody profile indicative of a more recent immune response to SARS-CoV-2. All infected individuals were oligo- or asymptomatic. Bi-weekly follow-up visits over the next 2 months will inform about the viral spread by a- and oligosymptomatic carriers and the individual changes in the immune profile.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chantal J.

Coronaviruses such as the 2003 SARS-CoV showed an increased risk of transmission during cooler days. We sought to analyse the effects of ambient temperature on SARS-COV-2 transmission and deaths related to the virus. Methods The world population of COVID-19 cases and attributable deaths from the 23rd January 2020 to 11th April 2020 were analysed. Temperature 5 days before cases and 23 days prior to deaths (to account for the time lag of incubation period and time from symptoms to death) was compared to the average temperature experienced by the world population. Results The total number of cases during this period was 1,605,788 and total number of deaths was 103,471. The median temperature at the time of COVID-19 infection was 9.12C (10-90th percentile 4.29-17.97C) whilst the median temperature of the world population for the same period was 9.61C warmer at 18.73C (10-90th percentile 4.09-28.49C) with a notional p-value = 5.1 x10-11. The median temperature at the time of a COVID-19 death was 9.72C (10-90th percentile 5.39-14.11C) whilst the median temperature of the world population was 7.55C warmer at 17.27C (10-90th percentile 2.57C-27.76C) with a notional p-value = 1.1 x10-10. 80% of all COVID-19 related cases and deaths occurred between 4.29C and 17.97C. Conclusion A definitive association between infection rate and death from COVID-19 and ambient temperature exists, with the highest risk occurring around 9C. Governments should maintain vigilance with containment strategies when the ambient temperatures correspond to this highest risk.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anver Sethwala","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Akbarally","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Nathan Better","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Lefkovits","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Leeanne Grigg","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huzefa Akbarally","author_inst":"Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science"},{"author_name":"Clarissa P.

Using a within-hospital SEIR transition model of SARS-CoV-2 in a typical UK hospital, we predict that approximately 20% of infections in inpatients, and 89% of infections in HCWs were due to nosocomial transmission. Placing suspected COVID-19 patients in single rooms or bays has the potential to reduce hospital-acquired infections in patients by up to 80%. Periodic testing of HCWs has a smaller effect on the patient-burden of COVID-19 but would considerably reduce infection in HCWs by as much as 64% and result in only a small proportion of staff absences (approximately 1% per day). This is considerably fewer than currently observed due to suspected COVID-19 and self-isolation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephanie Evans","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emily Agnew","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emilia Vynnycky","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julie V Robotham","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Leeanne Grigg","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huzefa Akbarally","author_inst":"Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science"},{"author_name":"Clarissa P.

Our results highlight the significant impact these NPIs had across states, reducing an average R_t >3 to an average of 1.5 by 9-May-2020, but that these interventions failed to reduce R_t <1, congruent with the worsening epidemic Brazil has experienced since. We identify extensive heterogeneity in the epidemic trajectory across Brazil, with the estimated number of days to reach 0.1 % of the state population infected since the first nationally recorded case

Populations heavily exposed to the novel coronavirus provide an opportunity to estimate the mortality from COVID-19 in different age groups. Methods. The mortality reported by May 13 from COVID-19 among Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers, and New York residents and Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) workers was estimated based on publicly available information. Results. The mortality among children (age 0 to 17 yrs) in New York City was 1 in 172,692. The mortality in New York state was 1 in 322,217 for ages 10-19 yrs., and 1 in 36,725 for ages 20-29 yrs. The mortality among New York transit workers was estimated to be 1 in 7,329 for ages 30-39 years; 1 in 1,075 for ages 40-49 yrs.; 1 in 343 for ages 50-59 yrs.; and 1 in 178 for ages 60-69 yrs. Among Diamond Princess passengers, the mortality was estimated to be 1 in 145 for ages 70-79, and 1 in 54 for ages 80-89. Conclusions: Mortality among populations exposed to the novel coronavirus increases with age, ranging from about 1 in 170,000 below the age of 18 years, to 1 in 54 above the age of 80 years.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher T Leffler","author_inst":"Virginia Commonwealth University"},{"author_name":"Matthew C Hogan","author_inst":"Virginia

States like Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu are the spike states as suggested by the range of expected COVID-19 patients and deaths. Impact of return of stranded pilgrims from Nanded (Maharashtra) has also been looked into in the case of Punjab. It has been found that Punjab may see ~ 5 times increase in the lower bound of expected patients till 10th June 2020 due to the return of pilgrims from Maharashtra. Our study provides an insight into the possible number of expected patients and deaths in near future that may be of importance for the respective governments to be ready with the appropriate

Sclerosis (MS) and related disorders with COVID-19 illness. Methods: From March 16 to April 30th, 2020, patients with MS or related disorders at NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center (MSCC) were identified with laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by a review of in-patient hospital records. Results: We identified 76 patients (55 with relapsing MS of which 9 had pediatric-onset;17 with progressive MS; and 4 with related disorders). 37 underwent PCR testing and were confirmed positive. Of the entire group, 64 (84%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) including anti-CD20 therapies (n=34, 44.7%) and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (n=10, 13.5%). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, but 21.1% of patients had neurologic symptom recrudescence preceding or coinciding with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7%) were hospitalized; 8 (10.5%) had COVID-19 critical illness or related death. Features more common among those hospitalized or with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, progressive disease, and a non-ambulatory status. No DMT class was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or fatal outcome. Conclusions: Most MS patients with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization despite being on DMTs. Factors associated with critical illness were similar to the general at risk patient population. DMT use did not emerge as a predictor of poor COVID-19 outcome in this preliminary sample.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erica Parrotta","author_inst":"NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center"},{"author_name":"Ilya Kister","author_inst":"NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center"},{"author_name":"Leigh Charvet","author_inst":"NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center"},{"author_name":"Carrie Sammarco","author_inst":"NYU MS Comprehensive Care Center"},{"author_name":"Valerie Saha","author_inst":"NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center"},{"author_name":"R.E.

ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there are concerns that patients may be avoiding care for emergent and urgent health conditions due to fear of contagion or as an unintentional consequence of government orders to postpone non-essential services. We therefore sought to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of patient encounters for select emergent or urgent diagnoses at a large tertiary-care academic medical center in Boston. Inpatient diagnoses included acute myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and outpatient but urgent diagnoses included new referrals for breast and hematologic malignancies. For each condition, we used a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the proportional change in number of encounters during the pandemic (March-April 2020) compared with earlier in the same year (January-February 2020), using equivalent periods in 2019 as a control. After the onset of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in hospitalizations for MI (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.46-0.96; P=0.04) and stroke (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.28-0.65; P<0.001) (Table). In the ambulatory setting, there was a reduction in referrals for breast cancer and hematologic cancers, but this did not reach statistical significance until the month after the onset of the pandemic. Our findings suggest an urgent need for public health messaging to ensure that patients continue to seek care for acute emergencies. In addition, decisions by health systems regarding when to reinitiate non-emergent care should carefully factor in the harms of delayed diagnosis and treatment occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhruv S Kazi","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Wadhera","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Changyu Shen","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Kalon K.L.

SARS-CoV-2, the incidence of COVID-19 in Africa has been slower than predicted. We aimed to investigate a possible association between parasitic infections and COVID-19. Methods: An ecological study in which we analysed WHO data on COVID-19 cases in comparison to WHO data on helminths and malaria cases using correlation, regression, and Geographical Information Services analyses. Results: Of the global 3.34 million COVID-19 cases and 238,628 deaths as at May 4th 2020, Africa reported 0.029\/3.3 million (0.88%) cases and 1,064\/238,628 (0.45%) deaths. In 2018, Africa reported 213\/229 million (93%) of all malaria cases, 204\/229 million (89%) of schistosomiasis cases, and 271\/1068 million (25%) of soil-transmitted helminth cases globally. In contrast, Europe reported 1.5\/3.3 million (45%) of global COVID-19 cases and 142,667\/238,628 (59%) deaths. Europe had 5.8\/1068 million (0.55%) soil-transmitted helminths cases and no malaria\/schistosomiasis cases in 2018. We found an inverse correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 and malaria (r -0.17, p =0.002) and COVID-19 and soil-transmitted helminths (r -0.25, p <0.001). Malaria-endemic countries were less likely to have COVID-19 (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.90; p =0.02). Similarly, countries endemic for soil-transmitted helminths were less likely to have COVID-19 (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13-0.44; p <0.001), as were countries endemic for schistosomiasis (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11-0.45; p<0.001). Conclusions: One plausible hypothesis for the comparatively low COVID-19 cases\/deaths in parasite-endemic areas is immunomodulation induced by parasites. Studies to elucidate the relationship between parasitic infections and susceptibility to COVID-19 at an individual level are warranted.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth Ssebambulidde","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Ivan Segawa","author_inst":"Makerere Lung Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Kelvin M Abuga","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute Centre for Geographic Medicine Research-Coast, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Vivian Nakate","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Anthony Kayiira","author_inst":"St Francis Hospital Nsambya, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Jayne Ellis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Lillian Tugume","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Agnes N Kiragga","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"David B Meya","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Kevin Tabb","author_inst":"Beth Israel Lahey Health, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Robert W.

biggest pandemic of the century. It has already killed more than 250,000 people. Because of this, it is necessary quick and precise diagnosis test. The current gold standard is the RT-PCR with DNA sequencing and identification, but its results takes too long to be available. Tests base on IgM\/IgG antibodies have been used, but their sensitivity and specificity may be very low. Many studies have been demonstrating the Covid-19 impact in hematological parameters. This work proposes an intelligent system to support Covid-19 diagnosis based on blood testing. We tested several machine learning methods, and we achieved high classification performance: 95.159% +- 0.693 of overall accuracy, kappa index of 0.903 +- 0.014, sensitivity of 0.968 +- 0.007, precision of 0.938 +- 0.010 and specificity of 0.936 +- 0.011. These results were achieved using classical and low computational cost classifiers, with Bayes Network being the best of them. In addition, only 24 blood tests were needed. This points to the possibility of a new rapid test with low cost. The desktop version of the system is fully functional and available for free use.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Jeniffer Emidio de Almeida Albuquerque","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Gomes de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Emmanuel de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Agnes N Kiragga","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"David B Meya","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Kevin Tabb","author_inst":"Beth Israel Lahey Health, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Robert W.

(SARS-CoV-2) is the third virus that caused coronavirus-related outbreaks over the past 20 years. The outbreak was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, but rapidly progressed into a pandemic of an unprecedented scale since the 1918 flu pandemic. Besides respiratory complications in COVID-19 patients, clinical characterizations of severe infection cases showed several other comorbidities, including multiple organ failure (liver, kidney, and heart) and septic shock. To better understand COVID-19 pathogenesis in different human organs, we interrogated the presence of the virus in the blood, or any of its components, which might provide a form of trafficking or hiding to the virus. By computationally analyzing high-throughput sequence data from patients with active COVID-19 infection, we found evidence of only traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), while the virus RNA was abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the same patients. We also devised a \"viral spike-to-actin\" RNA normalization, as a metric to compare across various samples and minimize errors caused by intersample variability in human RNA. To the best of our knowledge, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the PBMC of COVID-19 patients has not been reported before, and this observation could suggest immune presentation, but discounts the possibility of extensive viral infection of lymphocytes or monocytes.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed Moustafa","author_inst":"American University in Cairo"},{"author_name":"Ramy K Aziz","author_inst":"Cairo University"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Jeniffer Emidio de Almeida Albuquerque","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Gomes de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Emmanuel de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Agnes N Kiragga","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"David B Meya","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Kevin Tabb","author_inst":"Beth Israel Lahey Health, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Robert W.

(COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread throughout over 200 countries, posing a global threat to human health. Till 15th May 2020, there are over 4.5 million confirmed cases, with roughly 300,000 death1. To date, most studies focus on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in indoor environment owing to its main transmission routes via human respiratory droplets and direct contact2,3. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can spill over and impose transmission risks to outdoor environments despite potential threats to people and communities. Here, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in 73 samples from outdoor environment of three hospitals in Wuhan. We detected SARS-CoV-2 in soils (205-550 copies\/g), aerosols (285-1,130 copies\/m3) and wastewaters (255 to 18,744 copies\/L) in locations close to hospital departments receiving COVID-19 patients or in wastewater treatment sectors. These findings reveal significant viral spillover in hospital outdoor environments that was possibly caused by respiratory droplets from patients or aerosolized particles from wastewater containing SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in other areas or on surfaces with regular disinfection implemented. Soils may behave as viral warehouse through deposition and serve as a secondary source spreading SARS-CoV-2 for a prolonged time. For the first time, our findings demonstrate that there are high-risk areas in hospital outdoor environments to spread SARS-CoV-2, calling for sealing of wastewater treatment unit and complete sanitation to prevent COVID-19 transmission risks.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dayi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng

2 (SARS-CoV-2) appeared throughout the World and currently affected more than 3.6 million people and caused the death of around 252,000 people. The novel strain of the coronavirus disease is transmittable at a devastating rate with a high rate of severe hospitalization even more so for the elderly population. Currently around 50,000 patients are in a seriously critical situation. Although 1.2 million patients recovered from the disease there are still more than 2.1 Million active cases. Naso-oro-pharyngeal swab samples as the first step towards detecting suspected infection of SARS-CoV-2 provides a non-invasive method for PCR testing at a high confidence rate. Furthermore, proteomics analysis of PCR positive and negative naso-oropharyngeal samples provides information on the molecular level which highlights disease pathology. Samples from 15 PCR positive cases and 15 PCR negative cases were analyzed with nanoLC-MS\/MS to identify the differentially expressed proteins. Proteomic analyses identified 207 proteins across the sample set and 17 of them were statistically significant. Protein-protein interaction analyses emphasized pathways like Neutrophil degranulation, Innate Immune System, Antimicrobial Peptides. Neutrophil Elastase (ELANE), Azurocidin (AZU1), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Myeloblastin (PRTN3), Cathepsin G (CTSG) and Transcobalamine-1 (TCN1) were found to be significantly altered in naso-oropharyngeal samples of SARS-CoV-2 patients. The identified proteins are linked to alteration in the innate immune system specifically via neutrophil degranulation and NETosis.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emel

presence of COVID-19 virus in the urine of infected patients and to explore the clinical features that can predict the presence of COVID-19 in urine. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of published literature between 30th December 2019 and 21st June 2020 was conducted on Pubmed, Google Scholar, Ovid, Scopus, and ISI web of science. Studies investigating urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 in infected patients were included. Two reviewers selected relative studies and performed quality assessment of individual studies. Meta-analysis was performed on the pooled case reports and cohort with a sample size of >= 9. Results: Thirty-nine studies were finally included in the systematic review; 12 case reports, 26 case series, and one cohort study. Urinary samples from 533 patients were investigated. Fourteen studies reported the presence of COVID19 in the urinary samples from 24 patients. The crude overall rate of COVID-19 detection in urinary samples was 4.5%. Considering case series and cohorts with a sample size of >= 9, the estimated viral shedding frequency was 1.18 % (CI 95%: 0.14 - 2.87) in the metaanalysis. In adult patients, urinary shedding of COVID-19 was commonly detected in patients with moderate to severe disease (16 adult patients with moderate or severe disease versus two adult patients with mild disease). In children, urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 was reported in 4 children who all suffered from mild disease. Urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 was detected from day 1 to day 52 after disease onset. The pathogenicity of virus isolated from urine has been demonstrated in cell culture media in one study while another study failed to reveal replication of isolated viral RNA in cell cultures. Urinary symptoms were not attributed to urinary viral shedding. Conclusions: While COVID-19 is rarely detected in urine of infected individuals, infection transmission through urine still remains possible. In adult patients, infected urine is more likely in the presence of moderate or severe disease. Therefore, caution should be exerted when dealing with COVID-19 infected patients during medical interventions like endoscopy and urethral catheterization.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amir H Kashi","author_inst":"Urology and Nephrology Research Center (UNRC), Shahid Labbafinejad Hospital, Shahid Beheshti

urgent need for expanded access to rapid and sensitive SARS-CoV-2 testing worldwide. Here we present a simple clinical workflow that uses a sensitive and highly specific colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and takes forty minutes from sample collection to result. This test requires no specialized equipment and costs a few dollars per sample. Nasopharyngeal samples collected in saline were added either directly (unprocessed) to RT-LAMP reactions or first inactivated by a combined chemical and heat treatment step to inhibit RNases and lyse virions and human cells. The specimens were then amplified with two SARS-CoV-2-specific primer sets and an internal specimen control; the resulting color change was visually interpreted. While direct addition of unprocessed specimens to RT-LAMP reactions could reliably detect samples with abundant SARS-CoV-2, the assay sensitivity markedly increased after the addition of an inactivation step. In 62 clinical samples with a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid concentrations, the assay had 87.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a limit of detection at least 25 copies\/L, making it an ideal test to rule in infection. To increase sensitivity, samples that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by direct sample addition could be reflexed to a purification step, to increase the effective per-reaction sample input volume. In 40 purified samples, the assay yielded a 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with a limit of detection comparable to commercially available real-time PCR-based diagnostics that have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. This test for SARS-CoV-2 can be performed in a range of settings for a fraction of the price of other available tests, with limited equipment, and without relying on over-burdened supply chains to increase overall testing capacity.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Melis N Anahtar","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Graham EG McGrath","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brian A Rabe","author_inst":"Harvard University Medical School"},{"author_name":"Nathan A Tanner","author_inst":"New England Biolabs"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A White","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jochen K.M.

swabs","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20073577","rel_abs":"Background Determining the role of fomites in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is essential in the hospital setting and will likely be important outside of medical facilities as governments around the world make plans to ease COVID-19 public health restrictions and attempt to safely reopen economies. Expanding COVID-19 testing to include environmental surfaces would ideally be performed with inexpensive swabs that could be transported safely without concern of being a source of new infections. However, CDC-approved clinical-grade sampling supplies and techniques using a synthetic swab are expensive, potentially expose laboratory workers to viable virus and prohibit analysis of the microbiome due to the presence of antibiotics in viral transport media (VTM). To this end, we performed a series of experiments comparing the diagnostic yield using five consumer-grade swabs (including plastic and wood shafts and various head materials including cotton, synthetic, and foam) and one clinical grade swab for inhibition to RNA. For three of these swabs, we evaluated performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 in twenty intensive care unit (ICU) hospital rooms of patients with 16 COVID-19+. All swabs were placed in 95% ethanol and further evaluated in terms of RNase activity. SARS-CoV-2 was measured both directly from the swab and from the swab eluent.\n\nResults Compared to samples collected in VTM, 95% ethanol demonstrated significant inhibition properties against RNases. When extracting directly from the swab head as opposed to the eluent, RNA recovery was approximately 2-4x higher from all six swab types tested as compared to the clinical standard of testing the eluent from a CDC-approved synthetic swab. The limit of detection (LoD) of SARs-CoV-2 from floor samples collected using the CGp or TMI swabs was similar or better than the CDC standard, further suggesting that swab type does not impact RNA recovery as measured by SARs-CoV-2. The LoD for TMI was between 0-362.5 viral particles while SYN and CGp were both between 725-1450 particles. Lastly microbiome analyses (16S rRNA) of paired samples (e.g., environment to host) collected using different swab types in triplicate indicated that microbial communities were not impacted by swab type but instead driven by the patient and sample type (floor or nasal).\n\nConclusions Compared to using a clinical-grade synthetic swab, detection of SARS-CoV-2 from environmental samples collected from ICU rooms of patients with COVID was similar using consumer grade swabs, stored in 95% ethanol. The yield was best from the swab head rather than the eluent and the low level of RNase activity in these samples makes it possible to perform concomitant microbiome analysis.\n\nKeywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, RT-qPCR, swab, global health","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremiah J Minich","author_inst":"Marine Biology Research Division, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"Farhana Ali","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"Clarisse Marotz","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"Pedro Belda-Ferre","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"Leslie Chiang","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Justin P.

concerns about potentially high rates of thus far undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG can be helpful in identification of asymptomatic infections. We report baseline results of the CVOID-19 Contact (CoCo) Study, which follows 217 frontline healthcare workers at a university hospital and performs weekly SARS-CoV-2 specific serology (IgA\/IgG). The majority of participants had direct contact to patients with infectious respiratory diseases. Study participants estimated their personal likelihood of having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection with a mean of 20.9% (range 0 to 90%). In contrast, anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was in the range of 1-2% among health care workers. The CoCo Study is not fully representative for other hospitals and the sensitivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology in low prevalence conditions may require further improvement. Taken together, low rates of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in healthcare workers in Northern Germany are in sharp contrast to the high personal risk perception. Regular anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing of health-care workers may aid in monitoring the pandemic, assessing the quality of immune responses, directing resources for protective measures, and assuring CVID-19 care in the long run.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Georg MN Behrens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anne Cossmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Metodi V Stankov","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Torsten Witte","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Diana Ernst","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christine Happle","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Jablonka","author_inst":"Hannover Medical  School"},{"author_name":"Daniel McDonald","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"Jack A Gilbert","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Center for Microbiome Innovation,University of California San Diego, La Jolla"},{"author_name":"Sarah M.

involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, scarce information is available regarding the morphological and functional features of cardiac impairments in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective and serial echocardiographic study to investigate the structural and functional cardiac changes among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). From January 21 to April 8, 2020, a total of 51 ICU patients (31 critically ill and 20 severely ill) with confirmed COVID-19 were monitored by serial transthoracic echocardiography examinations. Outcomes were followed up until April 8, 2020. RESULTS: Of 51 ICU patients, 33 (64.7%) had cardiovascular comorbidities. Elevations of levels of cardiac biomarkers including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide were observed in 62.7% and 86.3% of patients, respectively. Forty-two (82.3%) had at least one left-heart and\/or right-heart echocardiographic abnormality. The overall median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 65.0% (IQR 58.0-69.0%), with most (44,86.3%) having preserved LVEF. Sixteen patients (31.4%) had increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and 14 (27.5%) had right-ventricle (RV) enlargement. During the study period, 12 (23.5%) patients died. LVEF was comparable between survivors and non-survivors, while non-survivors had more often pulmonary hypertension (58.3% vs. 23.1%; P=0.028) and RV enlargement (58.3% vs. 17.9%, P=0.011). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated similar survival curves between patients with vs. without echocardiographic left-heart abnormalities (P=0.450 by log-rank test), while right-heart abnormalities had adverse impact on mortality (P=0.012 by log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Typical cardiac abnormality in ICU patients with COVID-19 was right-heart dysfunction with preserved LVEF. Echocardiographic right-heart dysfunction was associated with disease severity and increased mortality in patients affected by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Heng Ge","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Mingli Zhu","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jing Du","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Handong Jiang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhiqing Qiao","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhichun Gu","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Fenghua Li","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jun Pu Jr.","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Rob Knight","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics, Computer Science and Engineering,  & Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA USA."},{"author_name":"Daniel A Sweeney","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"Austin D.

introduces an epidemiological model in which separate compartments are used for susceptible and asymptomatic \"socially distant\" populations. Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (\"CID\") in issuing separation mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight \"window of opportunity\" for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections --so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines-- action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule's frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jana Gevertz","author_inst":"The College of New Jersey, Ewing, NJ, United States"},{"author_name":"James Greene","author_inst":"Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, United States"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Hixahuary Sanchez Tapia","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Center for Quantitative Biology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States"},{"author_name":"Eduardo D Sontag","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Department of Bioengineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Handong Jiang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhiqing Qiao","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhichun Gu","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Fenghua Li","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jun Pu Jr.","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Rob Knight","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics, Computer Science and Engineering,  & Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA USA."},{"author_name":"Daniel A Sweeney","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"Austin D.

The dynamics of the pathogen incurred the incidence of the unidentified cases that were potentially substantial in magnitude. Unparalleled extensive measures, either in terms of medical quarantine or non-medical containment, were taken to deplete the growth of infected population and thereafter settle down the outbreak.

Mathematical models have been designed to estimate the numbers of spreaders in different scenarios in the present manuscript. In the present manuscript, three different mathematical models have been proposed with different scenarios such as screening, quarantine and NPIs for estimating number of virus spreaders. the analysis shows that the numbers of COVID-19 patients will be more without screening the peoples coming from other countries. Since, every people suffering with COVID-19 disease are spreaders. The screening and quarantine with NPIs have been implemented to study their impact on the spreaders. It has been found that NPI measures are able to reduce number of spreaders. The NPI measures reduces the growth of the spread function and providing decision makers more time to prepare with in dealing of the disease.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avaneesh Singh","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur, India"},{"author_name":"Saroj Kumar Chandra","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur, India"},{"author_name":"Manish Kumar Bajpai","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur, India"},{"author_name":"Yan Guo","author_inst":"Fujian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Handong Jiang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhiqing Qiao","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhichun Gu","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Fenghua Li","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jun Pu Jr.","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Rob Knight","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics, Computer Science and Engineering,  & Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA USA."},{"author_name":"Daniel A Sweeney","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"Austin D.
