Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation: The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhiliang Hu","author_inst":"Nanjing Infectious Disease Center, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Ci Song","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Chuanjun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Guangfu Jin","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Yaling Chen","author_inst":"Nanjing Infectious Disease Center, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Xin Xu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Hongxia Ma","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Research Center, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Yuan Lin","author_inst":"Department of Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Yishan Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Critical Medicine, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Jianming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"zhibin hu","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yongxiang Yi","author_inst":"Nanjing Infectious Disease Center, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbing Shen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.18.20024281","rel_title":"Phase adjusted estimation of the number of 2019 novel coronavirus cases in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.18.20024281","rel_abs":"An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV \/ SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huwen Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Zezhou Wang","author_inst":"Department of Cancer Prevention, Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University; Department of oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200025, "},{"author_name":"Yinqiao Dong","author_inst":"Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang 110122, China"},{"author_name":"Ruijie Chang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Chen Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Shuxian Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Lhakpa Tsamlag","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Meili Shang","author_inst":"Sanlin Community Health Service Center, Shanghai 200124, China"},{"author_name":"Jinyan Huang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine (Shanghai), Rui-Jin Hospital, Sh"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Tian Shen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Xinxin Zhang","author_inst":"Research Laboratory of Clinical Virology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine (Shanghai)c, Rui-Jin Hospital, and Rui-Jin Hospital North, Shangha"},{"author_name":"Yong Cai","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.19.20025148","rel_title":"Trends and prediction in daily incidence of novel coronavirus infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City: an application of Farr law","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.19.20025148","rel_abs":"Background: The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected tens of thousands of patients in China. Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr law is a classic epidemiology theory\/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models. Conclusions: This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing. However, there is a possibility of upward trend.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yajiao Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wei V.

It may give the public some scientific information to ease the fear of the epidemic. Objective: In December 2019, pneumonia infected with the novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. We aimed to use a mathematical model to predict number of diagnosed patients in future to ease anxiety on the emergent situation. Design: According to all diagnosis number from WHO website and combining with the transmission mode of infectious diseases, the mathematical model was fitted to predict future trend of outbreak. Setting: Our model was based on the epidemic situation in China, which could provide referential significance for disease prediction in other countries, and provide clues for prevention and intervention of relevant health authorities. Participants: In this retrospective, all diagnosis number from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020 reported from China was included and downloaded from WHO website. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We develop a simple but accurate formula to predict the next day diagnosis number:N_i\/N_(i-1) =[(N_(i-1)\/N_(i-2) )]^where Ni is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, and  was estimated as 0.904 at Feb 10. Results: Based on this model, it is predicted that the rate of disease infection will decrease exponentially. The total number of infected people is limited; thus, the disease will have limited impact. However, new diagnosis will last to March.

This study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors. Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regressions were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem. Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people (P<0.001). Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality (P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and times to focus on the COVID-19 ([&ge;] 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were associated with poor sleep quality. Conclusions: Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Young people, people who spent too much time on the epidemic, and healthcare workers were at high risk for mental illness. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yeen Huang","author_inst":"The 6th Affiliated hospital of Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Nanshan Hospital Affiliated to Shenzhen University Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ning Zhao","author_inst":"The 6th Affiliated hospital of Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Nanshan Hospital Affiliated to Shenzhen University Shenzhen, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Carla Acciarri","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences \"L.

Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting delays.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aniruddha Adiga","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Srinivasan Venkatramanan","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"James Schlitt","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Akhil Peddireddy","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Allan Dickerman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Andrei Bura","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Andrew Warren","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Brian D Klahn","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chunhong Mao","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Dawen Xie","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Dustin Machi","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Erin Raymond","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Fanchao Meng","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Golda Barrow","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Henning Mortveit","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Jiangzhuo Chen","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Jim Walke","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Joshua Goldstein","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Mandy L Wilson","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Mark Orr","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.21.20026070","rel_title":"CoVID-19 in Japan: What could happen in the future?","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.21.20026070","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has been impacting on the whole world critically and constantly Since December 2019.

It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy. Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay. Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chenyao Lin","author_inst":"Department of Blood Transfusion, ZhongNan hospital of Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical laboratory, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Mingzhe Yan","author_inst":"Department of Clinical laboratory, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Hongze Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical laboratory, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuang Huang","author_inst":"Department of Blood Transfusion, ZhongNan hospital of Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Changxin Shen","author_inst":"Department of Blood Transfusion, ZhongNan hospital of Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Yan","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Yu Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Keji Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Boxi Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Luo","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Christopher Y.

Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets. According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with 2019-nCoV than healthy people. Our data may provide a theoretical basis for the classification and management of future 2019-nCoV susceptibility people in clinical application.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haoyan Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Baoqin Xuan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes,Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University."},{"author_name":"Yuqing Yan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Chaoqin Shen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Gang Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Linhua Ji","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Danhua Xu","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hua Xiong","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Disease; Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University."},{"author_name":"TaChung Yu","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Li","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Disease; Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yingxuan Chen","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Disease; Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yun Cui","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Disease; Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Jie Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"gastroenterology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.20.20025338","rel_title":"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Immediate Psychological Impact on 5062 Health Workers","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.20.20025338","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (HWs). We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of working> 10 years (HR, 2.02; P<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (HR, 1.51; P<0.001), history of mental disorders (HR, 3.27; P<0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (HR, 1.23; P=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [OR], 0.76; P=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (OR, 0.69; P=0.004) were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological protective measures implemented by the hospital could be helpful.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhou Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shabei Xu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zheng Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Guo Li","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jinfeng Miao","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chenyan Zhang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuan Yang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Suiqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yebin Fan","author_inst":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Hu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.21.20026146","rel_title":"Public Exposure to Live Animals, Behavioural Change, and Support in Containment Measures in response to COVID-19 Outbreak: a population-based cross sectional survey in China","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.21.20026146","rel_abs":"Background In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures. Methods A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities. Findings Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119\/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102\/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0.001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p<0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P<0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures. Interpretation The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Hou","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Leesa Lin","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Development Faculty of Public Health and Policy London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liang Lu","author_inst":"West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxing Du","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Liang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yuan Yang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Suiqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yebin Fan","author_inst":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Hu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.16.951913","rel_title":"Single cell RNA sequencing of 13 human tissues identify cell types and receptors of human coronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-02-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.16.951913","rel_abs":"The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors\/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted \"CellPhoneDB\" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Leesa Lin","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Development Faculty of Public Health and Policy London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liang Lu","author_inst":"West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxing Du","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Liang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yuan Yang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Suiqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yebin Fan","author_inst":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Hu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.17.951939","rel_title":"Protection of Rhesus Macaque from SARS-Coronavirus challenge by recombinant adenovirus vaccine","rel_date":"2020-02-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.17.951939","rel_abs":"A recombinant adenovirus vaccine against the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was constructed, which contains fragments from the S, N, and Orf8 genes.

With the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019-nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was shown that the RBD-ACE2 binding free energy for 2019-nCoV is significantly lower than that for SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiahua He","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huanyu Tao","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yumeng Yan","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng-You Huang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hua Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Linlin Bao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tong Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Suiqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yebin Fan","author_inst":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Hu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.20.958272","rel_title":"A Multiscale and Comparative Model for Receptor Binding of 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the Implication of its Life Cycle in Host Cells","rel_date":"2020-02-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.20.958272","rel_abs":"The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhaoqian Su","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yinghao Wu","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yumeng Yan","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng-You Huang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hua Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Linlin Bao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tong Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Suiqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yebin Fan","author_inst":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Hu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.19.955484","rel_title":"Potential T-cell and B-cell Epitopes of 2019-nCoV","rel_date":"2020-02-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.19.955484","rel_abs":"As of early March, 2019-nCoV has infected more than one hundred thousand people and claimed thousands of lives. 2019-nCoV is a novel form of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has high similarity with SARS-CoV. No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.\n\nSignificance StatementThe novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes). Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure. We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses. Analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a potential form of immune evasion.

Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yasunori Watanabe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Zachary T.

The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Intikhab Alam","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"},{"author_name":"Allan K Kamau","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"},{"author_name":"Maxat Kulmanov","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Stefan T Arold","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Arnab T Pain","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"},{"author_name":"Takashi Gojobori","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"},{"author_name":"Carlos M.

Large RNA virus genomes, such as from Coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in E. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability1-3. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments. The technical advance we describe here allows to rapidly responding to emerging viruses as it enables the generation and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants - in real-time - during an outbreak.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tran Thi Nhu Thao","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Fabien Labroussaa","author_inst":"Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jamine Portmann","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jenna Kelly","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvio Steiner","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Melle Holwerda","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Annika Kratzel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mitra Gultom","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laura Laloli","author_inst":"Insitute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Linda Huesser","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Manon Wider","author_inst":"Insitute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Pfaender","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dagny Hirt","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Valentina Cippa","author_inst":"Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvia Crespo-Pomar","author_inst":"Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Simon Schroeder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporatemember of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute "},{"author_name":"Doreen Muth","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporatemember of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute "},{"author_name":"Daniela Niemeyer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporatemember of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute "},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporatemember of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute "},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporatemember of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute "},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Insitute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Joerg Jores","author_inst":"Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.15.20023333","rel_title":"The role of institutional trust in preventive and treatment-seeking behaviors during the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak among residents in Hubei, China","rel_date":"2020-02-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.15.20023333","rel_abs":"Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

Recently, a severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus was reported at December 2019 (2019-nCoV) in the city Wuhan, Hubei province, China3-5, which was also named as pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome (PARS)6. Up to 9th of February 2020, at least 37, 251 cases have been reported with 812 fatal cases according to the report from China CDC. However, the immune mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from patients of 2019-nCoV is still unknown. Here we show that after the 2019-nCoV infection, CD4+T lymphocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM-CSF etc. The cytokines environment induces inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and accelerates the inflammation. These aberrant and excessive immune cells may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung functional disability and quick mortality. Our results demonstrate that excessive non-effective host immune responses by pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes may associate with severe lung pathology. Therefore, we suggest that monoclonal antibody that targets the GM-CSF or interleukin 6 receptor may potentially curb immunopathology caused by 2019-nCoV and consequently win more time for virus clearance.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yonggang Zhou","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Binqing Fu","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Zheng","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Dongsheng Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Changcheng Zhao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Qi","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Rui Sun","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Tian","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Haiming Wei","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Laura Laloli","author_inst":"Insitute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Linda Huesser","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Manon Wider","author_inst":"Insitute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Pfaender","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dagny Hirt","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Valentina Cippa","author_inst":"Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvia Crespo-Pomar","author_inst":"Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Simon Schroeder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporatemember of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute "},{"author_name":"Doreen Muth","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporatemember of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute "},{"author_name":"Daniela Niemeyer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporatemember of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute "},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporatemember of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute "},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporatemember of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute "},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Insitute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Joerg Jores","author_inst":"Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.17.951335","rel_title":"Isolation and Characterization of 2019-nCoV-like Coronavirus from Malayan Pangolins","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.17.951335","rel_abs":"The outbreak of 2019-nCoV in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019 poses unprecedent public health challenges to both China and the rest world1. The new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified bat coronavirus2. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. The newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a continuous threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kangpeng Xiao Sr.","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Junqiong Zhai","author_inst":"Guangzhou Zoo"},{"author_name":"Yaoyu Feng","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Niu Zhou","author_inst":"Guangzhou Zoo"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Jie-Jian Zou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Wildlife Rescue Center"},{"author_name":"Na Li","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yaqiong Guo","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Li","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Xuejuan Shen","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Zhipeng Zhang","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Fanfan Shu","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Wanyi Huang","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yu Li","author_inst":"China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Ziding Zhang","author_inst":"China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Rui-Ai Chen","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Ya-Jiang Wu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Zoo"},{"author_name":"Shi-Ming Peng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Zoo"},{"author_name":"Mian Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Zoo"},{"author_name":"Wei-Jun Xie","author_inst":"Guangzhou Zoo"},{"author_name":"Qin-Hui Cai","author_inst":"Guangzhou Zoo"},{"author_name":"Fang-Hui Hou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Wildlife Rescue Center"},{"author_name":"Yahong Liu","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Wu Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Zoo"},{"author_name":"Lihua Xiao","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yongyi Shen","author_inst":"South China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"}]}
