However, all laboratory tests are imperfect and have estimates of sensitivity and specificity less than 100% - in some cases considerably less than 100%. That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence of COVID-19 is low, possibly in the range of 1-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that will most likely be larger and possibly much larger than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. In this paper we outline methods for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. The methods if employed would also help to harmonize study results within countries and around the world. Adjustment can lead to more accurate prevalence estimates and to better policy decisions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Sempos","author_inst":"Vitamin D Standardization Program LLC"},{"author_name":"Lu Tian","author_inst":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20098525","rel_title":"A Proposed Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Study Evaluating Doxycycline for the Prevention of COVID-19 Infection and Disease In Healthcare Workers with Ongoing High Risk Exposure to COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20098525","rel_abs":"This paper proposes both a rationale and potential study design for evaluation of low dose doxycycline (20mg BID) for the prevention of COVID-19 infection in exposed health care workers. More generally, it provides a potential study design blueprint to other investigators for any interventional COVID-19 study looking to evaluate interventions for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 infection. This specific study described is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxycycline for the prevention of COVID-19 infection and disease in healthcare workers with ongoing high risk exposure to COVID-19. This study would consist of a 50-day Treatment Period (Day 0-Day 50), followed by an End of Study Visit, approximately 30 days after completion of study drug dosing. Initially, for approximately the first 4 to 6 weeks, an initial open-label arm would be enrolled with up to 1938 subjects who will be assigned to take 20mg doxycycline BID. In the double blind, placebo controlled arms approximately 3,692 participants would be randomized to either doxycycline or placebo for 50 days. Doxycycline is a rational candidate drug to be evaluated for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2. Doxycycline is a generally safe tetracycline derivative that has been available for decades, most commonly dosed at 100mg BID to treat bacterial infections. However, in addition to its anti-microbial properties, doxycycline (and more generally tetracycline derivatives) may have a role as an effective anti-viral agent and as an anti-inflammatory drug. Early studies indicate potential efficacy of minocycline against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [12], and doxycycline against Dengue and Chikungunya infection[9, 10]. In addition, doxycycline is known or proposed to target several pathways that regulate viral replication. [13, 14, 15]. Doxycycline is a particularly attractive candidate as a COVID-19 prophylactic given it has been used in clinical practice for decades and maintains an excellent safety profile as demonstrated in multiple clinical studies. Any effective prophylaxis for COVID-19 should be able to demonstrate high efficacy at preventing infection and\/or lowering severity of disease. Equally important, it should demonstrate this efficacy at dosing levels that are highly unlikely to precipitate any untoward severe side effects. Doxycycline has been selected based on its ability to: 1) inhibit metalloproteinases (MMPs), implicated in initial viral entry into the cell as well as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe COVID-19 infection [13, 16]; 2) potential to inhibit Papain-like proteinase (PLpro) responsible for proteolytic cleavage of the replicase polyprotein to release non-structural proteins 1, 2 & 3 (Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3) all essential for viral replication. [19]; 3) potential to inhibit 3C-like main protease (3CLpro) or Nsp5 which is cleaved from the polyproteins causes further cleavage of Nsp4-16 and mediates maturation of Nsps which is essential in the virus lifecycle. [19]; 4) act as an ionophore help transport Zinc intracellularly, increasing cellular concentrations of Zinc to inhibit viral replication. [6, 15]; 5) inhibit Nf-kB which may lower inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection, and lower risk of viral entry due to decreasing DPP4 cell surface receptor. [20, 21]; 6) inhibits (specifically low-dose doxycycline) expression of CD147\/EMMPRIN that may be necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry into T lymphocytes [22, 23].","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul A Yates","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Ashton M Leone","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Elias Reichel","author_inst":"Tufts University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20098590","rel_title":"High sensitivity CDC EUA SARS-CoV-2 kit-based End Point-PCR assay.","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20098590","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is based on RT-qPCR protocols that limited testing to facilities with Real Time PCR devices and probes supply.

This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian nonlinear mixed model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectory. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for infections and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluate forecasting accuracy on a two-week holdout set, finding that the model predicts COVID-19 cases and deaths well, with a mean absolute scaled error of 0.40 for cases and 0.32 for deaths throughout the two-week evaluation period. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Ohio, and Mississippi. The sophistication and accuracy of this COVID-19 model offer reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates for the current trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and provide a platform for future predictions as shifting political and societal responses alter its course.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gregory L Watson","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Di Xiong","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Joseph A Zoller","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"John Shamshoian","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Phillip Sundin","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Teresa Bufford","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Anne W Rimoin","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Marc A Suchard","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Christina M Ramirez","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20098186","rel_title":"Excess Out-Of-Hospital Mortality and Declining Oxygen Saturation Documented by EMS During the COVID-19 Crisis in Tijuana, Mexico","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20098186","rel_abs":"Objective: Emergency medical services (EMS) may serve as a key source of rapid data about the evolving health of COVID-19 affected populations. A study in Italy reported that EMS-documented out-of-hospital cardiac arrest rose by 58% during the peak-epidemic. EMS and hospital reports from several countries have suggested that silent hypoxemia-low oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the absence of dyspnea-is associated with COVID-19 outbreaks. It is unclear, however, how these phenomena can be generalized to low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Tijuana is a city on the Mexico-United States border that may serve as a bellwether for cities in other LMICs. Using EMS data, we assess changes in out-of-hospital mortality and the SpO2 of respiratory patients during the COVID-19 period. Methods: We calculated numbers of weekly out-of-hospital deaths and respiratory cases seen by EMS in Tijuana, and estimate the difference between peak-epidemic rates and forecasted 2014-2019 trends. Results were compared with official COVID-19 statistics, stratified by neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and examined for changing demographic or clinical features, including mean (SpO2). Results: An estimated 194.7 (95%CI: 135.5-253.9) excess out-of-hospital deaths events occurred during April 14th-May 11th, representing an increase of 145% (70%-338%) compared to forecasted trends. During the same window, only 8 COVID-19-positive, out-of-hospital deaths were reported in official statistics. This corresponded with a rise in respiratory cases of 274% (119%-1142%), and a drop in mean SpO2 to 77.7%, from 90.2% at baseline. Peak respiratory cases were concentrated in high-SES neighborhoods, while the highest out-of-hospital death rates were observed in low-SES areas. Conclusions: EMS systems may play an important sentinel role in monitoring excess out-of-hospital mortality and other trends during the COVID-19 crisis in LMICs. Using EMS data, we observed increases in out-of-hospital deaths in Tijuana that were nearly threefold greater magnitude than increases reported in Italy. Furthermore, these deaths may be missing from official records describing COVID-19 patients. We also found evidence of worsening hypoxemia among respiratory patients seen by EMS, suggesting a rise in silent hypoxemia, which should be met with increased detection and clinical management efforts. Finally, we observed that social disparities in out-of-hospital death that warrant monitoring and amelioration.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Friedman","author_inst":"Center for Social Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA"},{"author_name":"Alheli Calderon-Villarreal","author_inst":"Academia Mexicana de la Salud, Tijuana, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Ietza Bojorquez","author_inst":"El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, Tijuana, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Carlos Vera Hernandez","author_inst":"Mexican Red Cross, Tijuana, Mexico"},{"author_name":"David Schriger","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eva Tovar Hirashima","author_inst":"Mexican Red Cross, Tijuana, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Teresa Bufford","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Anne W Rimoin","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Marc A Suchard","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Christina M Ramirez","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20099135","rel_title":"Covid-19 by Race and Ethnicity: A National Cohort Study of 6 Million United States Veterans","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20099135","rel_abs":"Background: There is growing concern that racial and ethnic minority communities around the world are experiencing a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality from symptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Most studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities to date have focused on hospitalized patients or have not characterized who received testing or those who tested positive for Covid-19. Objective: To compare patterns of testing and test results for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) and subsequent mortality by race and ethnicity in the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Participants: 5,834,543 individuals in care, among whom 62,098 were tested and 5,630 tested positive for Covid-19 between February 8 and May 4, 2020. Exposures: Self-reported race\/ethnicity. Main outcome measures: We evaluated associations between race\/ethnicity and receipt of Covid-19 testing, a positive test result, and 30-day mortality, accounting for a wide range of demographic and clinical risk factors including comorbid conditions, site of care, and urban versus rural residence. Results: Among all individuals in care, 74% were non-Hispanic white (white), 19% non-Hispanic black (black), and 7% Hispanic. Compared with white individuals, black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested for Covid-19 (tests per 1000: white=9.0, [95% CI 8.9 to 9.1]; black=16.4, [16.2 to 16.7]; and Hispanic=12.2, [11.9 to 12.5]). While individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (black vs white: OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.81 to 2.12; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.96), 30-day mortality did not differ by race\/ethnicity (black vs white: OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.33; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.87). Conclusions: Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of Covid-19 not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care. While there was no observed difference in mortality by race or ethnicity, our findings may underestimate risk in the broader US population as health disparities tend to be reduced in VA.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher T.

Near-future estimates are also useful for outbreaks of other diseases. Short-term predictions are unlikely to be affected by changes in herd immunity. In the absence of major net changes in factors that affect reproduction number (R), the two-parameter exponential model should be a standard model - indeed, it has been standard for epidemiological analysis of pandemics for a century but in recent decades has lost popularity to more complex compartmental models. Exponential model should be routinely included in reports describing epidemiological models as a reference, or null hypothesis. Exponential models should be fitted separately for each epidemiologically distinct jurisdiction. They should also be fitted separately to time intervals that differ by any major changes in factors that affect R. Using an exponential model, incidence-count half-life is a better statistic than R. Here an example of the exponential model is applied to King County, Washington during Spring 2020. The parameters and predictions of this model have remained stable for at least 45 days and the accuracy of model predictions has outperformed models with more parameters.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jared C Roach","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Farah Kidwai-Khan","author_inst":"US Department of Veterans Affairs, Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Janet P.

Here, we validate use of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) intended for rapid screening and qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in serum, plasma, and whole blood, and compare results with ELISA. We also seek to establish the value of LFI testing on blood obtained from a capillary blood sample. Methods: Samples collected by venous blood draw and capillary finger stick were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR and control patients negative for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG\/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) lateral flow immunoassay, and antibody calls were compared with results obtained by ELISA. Results: The Biolidics LFI kit shows clinical sensitivity of 92% at 7 days after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 on venous blood. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG. There was no significant difference in detecting IgM and IgG with Biolidics LFI and ELISA at D0 and D7 (p=1.00), except for detection of IgM at D7 (p=0.04). Finger stick whole blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients showed 93% sensitivity for antibody detection.

Furthermore, we show that capillary blood obtained by finger stick shows similar sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies as venous blood samples. This provides an opportunity for decentralized rapid testing in the community and may allow point-of-care and longitudinal self-testing for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Margaret A Black","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Guomiao Shen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Feng","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Wilfredo Garcia Beltran","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Feng","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Varshini Vasudevaraja","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Allison","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

The current study systematically examines the emerging evidence to identify an association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and COVID-19 disease outcome. Methods: Online literature databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Medrixv and BioRixv) were screened following standard search strategy having the appropriate keyword such as Obesity, Underweight, BMI, Body Mass Index, 2019-nCov, COVID-19, novel coronavirus, coronavirus disease. Studies published till 20th April 2020 were included without language restriction. These studies include case reports, case series, cohort, and any other which reported BMI, overweight\/obesity or underweight, and its complication with COVID-19 disease. Findings: Obesity plays a significant part in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients, though the role of BMI in the COVID-19 pandemic must not be ignored. Interpretation: Consequences of inflammation of adipose tissue has been reported as a leading cause of insulin resistance and hypertension due to metabolic dysfunction. The results of the current study show that BMI plays a significant role in COVID-19 severity in all ages, especially the elderly population. A panel should review COVID-19 patients with higher BMI and other co-morbidities, and they should be given increased vigilance, testing priority, and therapy. Further, the COVID-19 patients whose illness entered 7-10 days, age >50 yrs, and elevated CRP levels should have additional medical considerations. Recommendation: Population and patients with high BMI have moderate to high risk of medical complications with COVID-19, and hence their health status should be monitored more frequently.

We quantified access to public parks and gardens in urban areas of England and Wales, and the potential for park crowdedness during periods of high use. We combined data from the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance Survey to quantified (i) the number of parks within 500 and 1,000 metres of urban postcodes (i.e., availability), (ii) the distance of postcodes to the nearest park (i.e., accessibility), and (iii) per-capita space in each park for people living within 1,000m. We examined variability by city and share of flats. Around 25.4 million people can access public parks or gardens within a ten-minute walk, while 3.8 million residents live farther away; of these 21% are children and 13% are elderly. Areas with a higher share of flats on average are closer to a park but people living in these areas are potentially less able to meet social distancing requirements while in parks during periods of high use. Cities in England and Wales can provide residents with access to green space that enables outdoor exercise and play during social distancing. Keeping public parks and gardens open, might require measures such as dedicated park times for different age groups or entry allocation systems that, combined with smartphone apps or drones, can monitor and manage the total number of people using the park.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niloofar Shoari","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Majid Ezzati","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jill Baumgartner","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Diego Malacarne","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniela Fecht","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Varshini Vasudevaraja","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Allison","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

There is no existing pharmaceutical treatment that is known to be effective. Preliminary data shows that San Yao San Fang (SYSF) has clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19. The aim of this paper is to review existing data regarding the use of formulas within San Yao San Fang in the treatment of COVID-19 Search Strategy: We searched through 5 databases for studies on SYSF and patients with COVID-19 through April 2020. Eligibility Criteria: We included studies that included formulas within San Yao San Fang with or without Western interventions against Western interventions. Main results: We included 7 studies involving 532 patients. SYSF combined with Western interventions improved the recovery rate of symptoms such as fever (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.40 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.66, P < 0.01)), cough (RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.82, P < 0.01)) and fatigue (RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.78, P < 0.01)) and other symptoms such as headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, myalgia, dyspnoea and chest tightness (RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.83, P < 0.01)) as compared to the control group. SYSF combined with Western interventions reduced the duration of fever as compared to the control group. (Mean difference (MD) -1.18 (95% CI -1.45 to -0.91, P < 0.01)) In regards to adverse events, there is no statistical difference between the treatment group and the control group. (RR 1.62 (95% CI 0.83 to 3.17, P = 0.16)). SYSF combined with Western interventions did not show to significantly reduce duration of hospitalisation as compared to the control group.

DESIGN: Qualitative study consisting of five focus groups carried out between 1st-4th May 2020 (39-42 days after the official start of the UK lockdown). SETTING: Online video-conferencing PARTICIPANTS: 22 participants, all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of different genders, ages, ethnicities and locations. RESULTS: Participants were split roughly equally in number across three groups: will use the app; will not be using the app; and undecided as to whether they will use the app. Analysis revealed five main themes: (1) Lack of information and misconceptions surrounding COVID-19 contact tracing apps; (2) concerns over privacy; (3) concerns over stigma; (4) concerns over uptake; and (5) contact tracing as the 'greater good'. These themes were found across the sample and the three groups. However, concerns over privacy, uptake and stigma were particularly significant amongst those state they will not be using the app and the view that the app is for the 'greater good' was particularly significant amongst those who stated they will be using the app. One of the most common misconceptions about the app was that it could allow users to specifically identify and map COVID-19 cases amongst their contacts and in their vicinity. CONCLUSIONS: We offer four recommendations: (1) To offset the fact that many people may not be accessing, or might be avoiding, news coverage on COVID-19, authorities must communicate to the public via a range of methods including but not limited to: social media ads, postal information, text messaging and other emergency alert systems. (2) Communications should emphasise that the app cannot enable the user to identify which of their contacts has reported COVID-19 symptoms or tested positive. (3) Communication should emphasise collective responsibility ('the greater good') to promote social norms around use of the app (4) Communication should provide a slogan that maximises clarity of message, for example: 'Download the app, protect the NHS, save lives'.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon N Williams","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Armitage","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Tova Tampe","author_inst":"Independent consultant, World Health Organisation"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Dienes","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Lin Ho Wong","author_inst":"Ong Fujian Chinese Physician Hall"},{"author_name":"Pang Ong Wong","author_inst":"Ong Fujian Chinese Physician Hall"},{"author_name":"Douglas Allison","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

Machine learning algorithms built on radiography images can be used as a decision support mechanism to aid radiologists to speed up the diagnostic process. The aim of this work is to conduct a critical analysis to investigate the applicability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the purpose of COVID-19 detection in chest X-ray images and highlight the issues of using CNN directly on the whole image. To achieve this task, we first use 12-off-the-shelf CNN architectures in transfer learning mode on 3 publicly available chest X-ray databases together with proposing a shallow CNN architecture in which we train it from scratch. Chest X-ray images fed into CNN models without any preprocessing to follow the many of researches using chest X-rays in this manner. Next, a qualitative investigation performed to inspect the decisions made by CNNs using a technique known as class activation maps (CAM). Using CAMs, one can map the activations contributed most to the decision of CNNs back to the original image to visualize the most discriminating regions on the input image. We conclude that CNN decisions should not be taken into consideration, despite their high classification accuracy, until clinicians can visually inspect, and approve, the region(s) of the input image used by CNNs that lead to its prediction.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Taban Majeed","author_inst":"Salahaddin University"},{"author_name":"Rasber Rashid","author_inst":"Koya University"},{"author_name":"Dashti Ali","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Aras Asaad","author_inst":"Oxford Drug Design"},{"author_name":"Lin Ho Wong","author_inst":"Ong Fujian Chinese Physician Hall"},{"author_name":"Pang Ong Wong","author_inst":"Ong Fujian Chinese Physician Hall"},{"author_name":"Douglas Allison","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

The results showed that one unqualified KN95 respirator (with the filtration efficiency of 72%{+\/-}3% for [&ge;]300 nm sodium chloride aerosol) still passed the test with a measured overall filtration efficiency of 98%{+\/-}3%, due to its larger most penetrating particle size compared to the typical N95 respirator.

This size shift caused the significant difference between the size specific (250 nm - 500 nm) filtration efficiency and overall filtration efficiency using the same NaCl test aerosol. For example, after three cycle H2O2 plasma vaporous sterilizations, the size specific filtration efficiency of the N95 was 55%{+\/-}2%, however, the measured overall filtration efficiency was still 86%{+\/-}5%.

Methods: Aerosol generation during phacoemulsification was assessed using a model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Typical phacoemulsification settings were used and visible aerosol production was recorded using high speed 4K camera. Aerosolisation was evaluated under various experimental settings: Two different phacoemulsification tip sizes (2.2mm, 2.75mm), varying levels of corneal moisture, the use of suction and blowing air in the surgical field, the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating of the cornea with a static and moving tip. Results: This model demonstrates visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification with a 2.75mm phacoemulsification tip. No visible aerosol was noted with a 2.2mm tip. The presence of visible aerosol is unrelated to corneal wetting. Suction in close proximity to the aerosol plume did not impact on its dispersion. Blowing air redirected the aerosol plume towards the ocular surface. Visible aerosol production was abolished when HPMC was used to coat the cornea. This effect lasted for an average of 67{+\/-}8 seconds in the static model. Visible aerosol generation was discerned during movement of the 2.2mm tip towards the corneal wound. Conclusions: We demonstrate visible aerosol production in the setting of a model of a clear cornea phacoemulsification. Visible aerosol can be reduced using a 2.2mm phacoemulsification tip and reapplying HPMC every minute during phacoemulsification.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kieren Darcy","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Omar Elhaddad","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Asaf Achiron","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johannes Keller","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Duncan Leadbetter","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Derek Tole","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sidath E Liyanage","author_inst":"Bristol Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, the risk factors, and laboratory correlates. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors since the start of the outbreak (February 24th to April 8th 2020, n=789). Presence of IgM\/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. Results: The test had a 100\/98.3 sensitivity\/specificity, and for IgG+ was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (N=34, P<0.001). At the outbreak start, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7%, 95% c.i. 0.3-6% (P<0.0001 vs. 120 historical controls). During the study period characterized by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2%, 95% c.i. 2.4-9.0, due to a rise in IgG+ tests to 5%, 95%CI 2.8-8.2 (P=0.004 for trend, adjusted weekly increase 2.7+\/-1.3%), but not of IgM+ (P=NS). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, seroconversion to IgG+ was more frequent in younger (P=0.043), while recent infections (IgM+) in older individuals (P=0.002). IgM+ was independently associated with higher triglycerides, eosinophils, and lymphocytes (P<0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the outbreak start. Social distancing may have been more effective in younger individuals, and by the end of April 2.4-9.0% of healthy adults had evidence of seroconversion. Asymptomatic infection may affect lipid profile and blood count.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luca Valenti","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Annalisa Bergna","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Serena Pelusi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Federica Facciotti","author_inst":"Istituto Europeo di Oncologia"},{"author_name":"Alessia Lai","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Maciej Tarkowski","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Berzuini","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda"},{"author_name":"Flavio Caprioli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Luigi Santoro","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Guido Baselli","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Carla Della Ventura","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Elisa Erba","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda"},{"author_name":"Silvano Bosari","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Daniele Prati","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Policlinico Milano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20098921","rel_title":"Behavioural change towards reduced intensity physical activity is disproportionately prevalent among adults with serious health issues or self-perception of high risk during the UK COVID-19 lockdown.","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20098921","rel_abs":"Importance: There are growing concerns that the UK COVID-19 lockdown has reduced opportunities to maintain health through physical activity, placing individuals at higher risk of chronic disease and leaving them more vulnerable to severe sequelae of COVID-19.

Doing less intensive physical activity during the lockdown was associated with obesity (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.41), hypertension (OR 1.52, 1.33-1.71), lung disease (OR 1.31,1.13-1.49), depression (OR 2.02, 1.82-2.22) and disability (OR 2.34, 1.99-2.69). Participants who reduced their physical activity intensity also had higher odds of being female, living alone or having no garden, and more commonly expressed sentiments about personal or household risks in narratives on coping. Conclusions and relevance: Groups who reduced physical activity intensity included disproportionate numbers of people with either heightened objective clinical risks or greater tendency to express subjective perceptions of risk. Policy on exercise for health during lockdowns should include strategies to facilitate health promoting levels of physical activity in vulnerable groups, including those with both objective and subjective risks.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nina Trivedy Rogers","author_inst":"University College London (UCL)"},{"author_name":"Naomi Waterlow","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hannah E Brindle","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luisa Enria","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelley Lees","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chrissy h Roberts","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Flavio Caprioli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Luigi Santoro","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Guido Baselli","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Carla Della Ventura","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Elisa Erba","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda"},{"author_name":"Silvano Bosari","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Daniele Prati","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Policlinico Milano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20098780","rel_title":"Estimating the Global Infection Fatality Rate of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20098780","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, resulting in nearly three hundred thousand deaths distributed heterogeneously across countries. Estimating the infection fatality rate (IFR) has been elusive due to the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections and lack of testing capacity. We analyze global data to derive the IFR of COVID-19. Estimates of COVID-19 IFR in each country or locality differ due to variable sampling regimes, demographics, and healthcare resources. We present a novel statistical approach based on sampling effort and the reported case fatality rate of each country. The asymptote of this function gives the global IFR. Applying this asymptotic estimator to cumulative COVID-19 data from 139 countries reveals a global IFR of 1.04% (CI: 0.77%,1.38%). Deviation of countries' reported CFR from the estimator does not correlate with demography or per capita GDP, suggesting variation is due to differing testing regimes or reporting guidelines by country. Estimates of IFR through seroprevalence studies and point estimates from case studies or sub-sampled populations are limited by sample coverage and cannot inform a global IFR, as mortality is known to vary dramatically by age and treatment availability. Our estimated IFR aligns with many previous estimates and is the first attempt at a global estimate of COVID-19 IFR.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Grewelle","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Giulio De Leo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Hannah E Brindle","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luisa Enria","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelley Lees","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chrissy h Roberts","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Flavio Caprioli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Luigi Santoro","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Guido Baselli","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Carla Della Ventura","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Elisa Erba","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda"},{"author_name":"Silvano Bosari","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Daniele Prati","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Policlinico Milano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20102079","rel_title":"Retrospective Pooled Screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in late 2019","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20102079","rel_abs":"Reports have emerged documenting earlier SARS-CoV-2 cases than previously recognized.

Taking into account parameters associated to the population of each city and the mobility among them, the optimal control framework suggests the level and duration of protective measures that must be implemented to ensure that the number of infected individuals is within a range that avoids the collapse of the health care system. Compared against other mitigation measures that are implemented simultaneously and in equal strength across cities our method has three major particularities when: Accounts for city commute and health infrastructure: It takes into account the daily commute among cities to estimate the dynamics of infected people while keeping the number of infected people within a desired level at each city avoiding the collapse of its health care system. City-specific control: It allows for orchestrating the control measures among cities so as to prevent all cities to face the same level control. The model tends to induce alternation between periods of stricter controls and periods of a more normal life in each city and among the cities. Flexible scenarios: It is flexible enough to allow for simulating the impact of particular actions. For example, one can simulate the how the control all cities change when the number of care beds increases in specific places. Therefore, our method creates an automatic dance adjusting mitigation levels within cities and alternating among cities as suggested in~\\cite{Pue2020}. This automatic dance may help the city economy and orchestration of resources. We provide case studies using the major cities of the state of Sao Paulo given by using estimates on the daily mobility among the cities their health care system capacity. We use official data in our case studies. However, sub-notification of infected people in Brazil is notoriously high. Hence the case study should not be considered as a real world policy suggestion. It high sub-notification is taken into account, the optimal control algorithm will suggest stricter mitigation measures, as also shown in the case studies. Surprisingly, the total duration of the protocol for the state is barely affected by the sub-notification, but the severity of such protocols is strengthened. This stresses a twofold implication, first, the protocol depends on high-quality data and, second, such optimal and orchestrated protocol is robust and can be adjusted to the demand.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paulo J.

Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of in vitro reconstituted Nsp1-40S and of native human Nsp1-ribosome complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C-terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel. Thereby, Nsp1 effectively blocks RIG-I-dependent innate immune responses that would otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection.

Here, we report that afucosylated IgG which are of minor abundance in humans ([~]6% of total IgG) are specifically formed against surface epitopes of enveloped viruses after natural infections or immunization with attenuated viruses, while protein subunit immunization does not elicit this low fucose response. This can give beneficial strong responses, but can also go awry, resulting in a cytokine-storm and immune-mediated pathologies. In the case of COVID-19, the critically ill show aggravated afucosylated-IgG responses against the viral spike protein. In contrast, those clearing the infection unaided show higher fucosylation levels of the anti-spike protein IgG.

In this study, an attempt is made to decipher the conservation of nucleotides, dimers, codons and amino acids in the ORF3a genes across thirty two genomes of Indian patients.

To overcome these limitations, we propose that elucidation and pharmacologic targeting of host cell Master Regulator proteins--whose aberrant activities govern the reprogramed state of infected-coronavirus cells--presents unique opportunities to develop novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to antiviral therapy, either as monotherapy or as a complement to established treatments. Specifically, we propose that a small module of host cell Master Regulator proteins (ViroCheckpoint) is hijacked by the virus to support its efficient replication and release. Conventional methodologies are not well suited to elucidate these potentially targetable proteins. By using the VIPER network-based algorithm, we successfully interrogated 12h, 24h, and 48h signatures from Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV, to elucidate the time-dependent reprogramming of host cells and associated Master Regulator proteins. We used the NYS CLIA-certified Darwin OncoTreat algorithm, with an existing database of RNASeq profiles following cell perturbation with 133 FDA-approved and 195 late-stage experimental compounds, to identify drugs capable of virtually abrogating the virus-induced Master Regulator signature. This approach to drug prioritization and repurposing can be trivially extended to other viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, as soon as the relevant infection signature becomes available.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pasquale Laise","author_inst":"DarwinHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Gideon Bosker","author_inst":"DarwinHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyun Sun","author_inst":"DarwinHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Yao Shen","author_inst":"DarwinHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Eugene F Douglass","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Charles Karan","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Ronald B Realubit","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sergey Pampou","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Andrea Califano","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Mariano J Alvarez","author_inst":"DarwinHealth Inc"},{"author_name":"Jan Nouta","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Suvi Natunen","author_inst":"Finnish Red Cross Blood Service"},{"author_name":"Carolien A.M.
