Sleep disorders are major mental health problems associated with increased psychosocial stressors; however, no research synthesis is available on the epidemiology of it. In this systematic scoping review, we aimed to assess the current evidence on the epidemiological burden, associated factors, and interventions from the existing literature. Method: Seven major health databases and additional sources were searched to identify, evaluate, and synthesize empirical studies on the prevalence and correlates of sleep disorders and available interventions. The Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology for Scoping Review were used, and the findings were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Results: A total of 78 articles were retrieved, the prevalence of sleeping disorders ranged from 2.3% to 76.6%. Age, sex, level of education, physical and mental health, COVID-19 related factors, occupation especially being health care workers (HCW) were the main associated factors. Only two intentions were identified to address the issue. Conclusion: The finding of this review indicated a high burden of sleep disorder with limited interventions that necessitate informing policymakers and practitioners to facilitate future research and implementations.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samia Tasnim","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Mariya Rahman","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Pawar","author_inst":"Mamta Foundation India"},{"author_name":"Xinli Chi","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Qian Yu","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Liye Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Abida Sultana","author_inst":"EviSyn Health"},{"author_name":"E.

Participants 10 401 participants aged 18-64, from a national cohort who lived in the three metropolitan French regions most affected by the first wave of COVID-19. Main outcome The main outcome was occurrence of possible COVID-19 symptoms, defined as the occurrence of sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and\/or anosmia, that lasted more than three days in the 15 days before the survey. We used multinomial regression models to identify social and health factors related to possible COVID-19 before and during the lockdown. Results In all, 1,304 (13.0%; 95% CI: 12.0%-14.0%) reported cases of possible COVID-19. The effect of lockdown on the occurrence of possible COVID-19 was different across social hierarchies. The most privileged class individuals saw a significant decline in possible COVID-19 infections between the period prior to lockdown and during the lockdown (from 8.8% to 4.3%, P=0.0001) while the decline was less pronounced among working class individuals (6.9% before lockdown and 5.5% during lockdown, P=0.03). This differential effect of lockdown remained significant after adjusting for other factors including history of chronic disease. The odds of being contaminated during lockdown as opposed to the prior period increased by 57% among working class individuals (OR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.0-2.48). The same was true for those engaged in in-person professional activities during lockdown (OR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.03-2.29). Interpretation Lockdown was associated with social inequalities in the decline in COVID-19 infections, calling for the adoption of preventive policies to account for living and working conditions. Such adoptions are critical to reduce social inequalities related to COVID-19, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathalie BAJOS","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Mariya Rahman","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Pawar","author_inst":"Mamta Foundation India"},{"author_name":"Xinli Chi","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Qian Yu","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Liye Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Abida Sultana","author_inst":"EviSyn Health"},{"author_name":"E.

The ensuing economic downturns and unemployment increases have led many nations to progressively relax mandates. As COVID19 transmission and deaths rise in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), with continuing widespread transmission elsewhere, policymakers are searching for options to reduce COVID19 mortality without reimposing strict social distancing mandates. Methods: Using a Bayesian meta-regression of 40 studies measuring the impact of mask use on respiratory viral infections, we estimated the reduction in transmission associated with the use of cloth or paper masks used in a general population setting. We used data from daily surveys conducted by Facebook, YouGov, and Premise, on the proportion of people reporting always wearing a mask outside their home for nearly all countries. We predicted deaths and infections until January 1st 2021 under a reference and universal mask use scenario using a deterministic transmission dynamics model with categories for susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered (SEIR). In the reference scenario, we assume continued easing of mandates but with action to re-impose mandates for a period of six weeks, at a level of eight daily deaths per million population. The universal mask scenario assumed scaling up of mask use to 95% over a one-week period. Findings: Use of simple masks can reduce transmission of COVID19 by 40% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 20% to 54%). Universal mask use would lead to a reduction of 815,600 deaths (95% UI 430,600 to 1,491,000 deaths) between August 26th 2020 and January 1st 2021, the difference between the predicted 3.00 million deaths (95% UI 2.20 to 4.52 million) in the reference and 2.18 million deaths (95% UI 1.71 to 3.14 million) in the universal mask scenario over this time period. Mask use was estimated at 59.0% of people globally on August 18th, ranging from 41.9% in North Africa and the Middle East to 79.2% in Latin America and the Caribbean. The effect of universal mask use is greatest in countries such as India (158,832 fewer deaths in universal mask scenario, 95% UI 75,152 to 282,838 deaths), the United States of America (93,495 fewer deaths; 95% UI 59,329 to 150,967 deaths), and Russia (68,531 fewer deaths; 95% UI 34,249 to 145,960 deaths). Interpretation: The rising toll of the COVID19 pandemic can be substantially reduced by the universal adoption of masks. This low-cost policy, whether customary or mandated, has enormous health benefits and likely large economic benefits as well, by delaying the need for re-imposition of social distancing mandates.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emmanuela Gakidou","author_inst":"IHME"},{"author_name":"- IHME COVID-19 Forecasting Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Priyanka Pawar","author_inst":"Mamta Foundation India"},{"author_name":"Xinli Chi","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Qian Yu","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Liye Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Abida Sultana","author_inst":"EviSyn Health"},{"author_name":"E.

Testing at individual building-level could be an efficient, passive means of preventing early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Sample collection protocols were developed and refined during preliminary sampling from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side-by-side to assess feasibility, performance and sensitivity. Optimized sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n=105 and 66) over eight weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24 hour composite collection had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. However, if the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive then the sensitivity would be 95.2% but the specificity would drop to 52%. We determined a highly sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 shedding in building wastewater however our methods could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Future work must focus on methods to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to widely deploy this promising wastewater surveillance tool.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lisa M Colosi","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Katie E Barry","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Shireen M Kotay","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Michael D Porter","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Melinda D Poulter","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Cameron Ratliff","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"William Simmons","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Rena G Morse","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Limor I Steinberg","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"D.

Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry before viral spread to the lung. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is rapidly progressing, the current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. Here, we show that AdCOVID, an intranasal adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits a strong and focused immune response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA, serum neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression profile. Therefore, AdCOVID, which promotes concomitant systemic and local mucosal immunity, represents a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rodney G.

These findings suggest an involvement of the brain- and peripheral vasculature in COVID-19, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 tropism for brain vasculature, we constructed a molecular atlas of the expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry-associated genes (receptors and proteases) and SARS-CoV-2 interaction partners in human (and mouse) adult and fetal brain as well as in multiple non-CNS tissues in single-cell RNA-sequencing data across various datasets. We observed a distinct expression pattern of the cathepsins B (CTSB) and -L (CTSL) - which are able to substitute for the ACE2 co-receptor TMPRSS2 - in the human vasculature with CTSB being mainly expressed in the brain vasculature and CTSL predominantly in the peripheral vasculature, and these observations were confirmed at the protein level in the Human Protein Atlas and using immunofluorescence stainings. This expression pattern of SARS-CoV-2 viralentry associated proteases and SARS-CoV-2 interaction partners was also present in endothelial cells and microglia in the fetal brain, suggesting a developmentally establishedSARS-CoV-2 entry machinery in the human vasculature. At both the adult and fetal stages, we detected a distinct pattern of SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes' transcripts in brain vascular endothelial cells and microglia, providing a potential explanation for an inflammatory response in the brain endothelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, CTSB was co-expressed in adult and fetal brain endothelial cells with genes and pathways involved in innate immunity and inflammation, angiogenesis, blood-brain-barrier permeability, vascular metabolism, and coagulation, providing a potential explanation for the role of brain endothelial cells in clinically observed (neuro)vascular symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Our study serves as a publicly available single-cell atlas of SARS-CoV-2 related entry factors and interaction partners in human and mouse brain endothelial- and perivascular cells, which can be employed for future studies in clinical samples of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Moheb Ghobrial","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Jason Charish","author_inst":"Krembil Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shigeki Takada","author_inst":"Krembil Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Taufik Valiante","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Philippe Monnier","author_inst":"Krembil Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ivan Radovanovic","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Gary Bader","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Thomas Waelchli","author_inst":"Division of Neurosurgery, Krembil Neuroscience Institute"},{"author_name":"John E.

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney of COVID-19 patients suggests renal tropism and direct infection. Presently, it is generally recognized that SARS-CoV-2 initiates invasion through binding of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein to host cell-membrane receptor ACE2, however, whether there is additional target of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney remains unclear. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1) is a transmembrane protein that drastically up-regulated after renal injury. Here, binding between SARS-CoV2-RBD and the extracellular Ig V domain of KIM1 was identified by molecular simulations and co-immunoprecipitation, which was comparable in affinity to that of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, KIM1 facilitated cell entry of SARS-CoV2-RBD, which was potently blockaded by a rationally designed KIM1-derived polypeptide. Together, the findings suggest KIM1 may mediate and exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection in a vicious cycle, and KIM1 could be further explored as a therapeutic target.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen Yang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuchen Chen","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dong Yang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"ZiWei Shen","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaomu Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xinran Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mingrui Xiong","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kun Huang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Guang Yang","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Fen Zhou","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Esther Zumaquero","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Thomas S.

These findings indicate that GX-19 vaccination provides durable protective immune response and also support further development of GX-19 as a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 in human clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yong Bok Seo","author_inst":"SL VaxiGen Inc."},{"author_name":"You Suk Suh","author_inst":"Genexine Inc."},{"author_name":"Ji In Ryu","author_inst":"SL VaxiGen Inc."},{"author_name":"Hwanhee Jang","author_inst":"SL VaxiGen Inc."},{"author_name":"Hanseul Oh","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Bon-Sang Koo","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sang-Hwan Seo","author_inst":"International Vaccine Institute"},{"author_name":"Jung Joo Hong","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Manki Song","author_inst":"International Vaccine Institute"},{"author_name":"Sung-Joo Kim","author_inst":"GenNBio Inc."},{"author_name":"Young Chul Sung","author_inst":"Genexine Inc."},{"author_name":"Fen Zhou","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Esther Zumaquero","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Thomas S.

To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search for treatments and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. We investigated the breadth and potency of antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with asymptomatic to severe infections. We report very broad serological profiles with cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses. Further, >99% had SARS-CoV-2 epitope specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 95% of individuals. A significant positive correlation between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 90% of HLA-A2+ individuals. The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of disease severity. These data support the possibility of achieving protective immunity through natural infection and bode well for the prospects of inducing immunological memory through vaccination.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stine Sofie Frank Nielsen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Line K Vibholm","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ida Monrad","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rikke Olesen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Giacomo S Frattari","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marie H Pahus","author_inst":"Aarhus University"},{"author_name":"Jesper F H\u00f8jen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jesper D Gunst","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian Erikstrup","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andreas Holleufer","author_inst":"Aarhus University"},{"author_name":"Rune Hartmann","author_inst":"Aarhus University"},{"author_name":"Lars \u00d8stergaard","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ole S S\u00f8gaard","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mariane H Schleimann","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martin Tolstrup","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John T.

The review will be kept live through regular updates. Design: The review was designed as a living systematic review to capture a rapidly evolving evidence base. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Setting: The review included remote home monitoring models led by primary and secondary care across seven countries. Participants: 17 examples of remote home monitoring models were included in the review. Main outcome measures: Impact of remote home monitoring on virtual length of stay, escalation, Emergency department attendance, reattendance, admission, readmission and mortality. Results: The primary aim of the remote home monitoring models was the early identification of deterioration for patients self-managing COVID-19 symptoms at home. Most models were led by secondary care. Broad criteria for the eligible patient population were used and confirmation of COVID-19 was not required (in most cases). Monitoring was carried via online platforms, paper-based systems with telephone calls or (less frequently) through wearable sensors. We could not reach conclusions regarding patient safety and the identification of early deterioration due to lack of standardised reporting across articles and missing data. None of the articles reported any form of economic analysis, beyond how the resources were used. Conclusions: The review pointed to variability in the implementation of the models, in relation to healthcare sector, monitoring approach and selected outcome measures. Lack of standardisation on reporting prevented conclusions on the impact of remote home monitoring on patient safety or early escalation during COVID-19. Future research should focus on staff and patient experiences of care and potential inequalities in access to these models. Attention needs to be paid to the processes used to implement these models, the evaluation of their impact on patient outcomes through the use of comparators, the use of risk-stratification tools, and cost-effectiveness of the models and their sustainability. Protocol registration: The review protocol was published on PROSPERO (CRD: 42020202888).","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cecilia Vindrola-Padros","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kelly Singh","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Manbinder S Sidhu","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Theo Georghiou","author_inst":"Nuffield Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Sherlaw-Johnson","author_inst":"Nuffield Trust"},{"author_name":"Sonila M Tomini","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Inada-Kim","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Karen Kirkham","author_inst":"General Practitioner NHS Dorset"},{"author_name":"Allison Streetly","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Naomi J Fulop","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Rune Hartmann","author_inst":"Aarhus University"},{"author_name":"Lars \u00d8stergaard","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ole S S\u00f8gaard","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mariane H Schleimann","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martin Tolstrup","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John T.

We verified and applied a two-tiered testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific lateral flow assay (LFA) with a nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA to assess seroconversion in n=7241 individuals. The majority had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but had no access to RT-PCR testing. Longitudinal follow-up in n=97 LFA+ individuals was performed up to 20 weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line with contracting NCP IgG titers during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titers, and both reach a plateau after approximately 100 days. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-focussed two-tiered serology approach. Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to individuals.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anja Garritsen","author_inst":"Innatoss Laboratories.

Paradoxically, a direct relationship has been suggested between COVID-19 disease severity, and the levels of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, including virus neutralizing titers. Through a serological analysis of serum samples from 536 convalescent healthcare workers, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody levels were indeed elevated in individuals that experienced severe disease. The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody was dominated by IgG, with an IgG subclass ratio skewed towards elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. However, RBD- and S1-specific IgG1, rather than IgG3 were best correlated with virus-neutralizing titers. We propose that Spike-specific IgG3 subclass utilization contributes to COVID-19 disease severity through potent Fc-mediated effector functions. These results have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design, and convalescent plasma therapy.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer L.

In Ethiopia, as of September 27, 2020, a total of 72,700 cases and 1165 deaths were reported. Objective: The study aimed to assess the determinants of death in Severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia. Methods: A case-control study of 147 Severe COVID-19 patients (49 deaths and 98 discharged alive cases) was conducted from August to September 2020. A comparison of underlying characteristics between cases (death) and controls (alive) was assessed using a chi-square test and an independent t-test with a p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the predictor variables and outcome of Severe COVID-19 (Alive Vs Death) where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. Results: Having diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.257, 95% CI= 1.348, 7.867, p-value=0.00), fever (AOR=0.328, 95% CI: 0.123, 0.878, p-value= 0.027) and Shortness of breath (AOR= 4.034, 95% CI= 1.481, 10.988, p-value=0.006) were found to be significant predictors of death in Severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: The outcome of death in Severe COVID-19 patients is found to be associated with exposures to being diabetic and having SOB at admission. On the other hand, having a fever at admission was associated with a favorable outcome of being discharged alive.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Endalkachew Hailu Maru","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Tigist Workneh Leulseged","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Ishmael Shemsedin Hassen","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Wuletaw Chane Zewde","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Nigat W\/Hawariyat Chamesew","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Daniel Simeneh Abebe","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Tariku Bahiru Jagema","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Abdi Bekele Bayisa","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Mesfin Abebe Gezahegn","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Oli Seyoum Tefera","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Tekete Tilahun Admasu","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Wondimagegn Genaneh Shiferaw","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Margaux Hales","author_inst":"NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Monir Ejemel","author_inst":"MassBiologics"},{"author_name":"Qi Li","author_inst":"MassBiologics"},{"author_name":"Yang Wang","author_inst":"MassBiologics"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Mantis","author_inst":"NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Kathleen A.

Automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) based analyzers become highly demanding platforms both to clinicians and policy makers for the detection anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In this study, serum from 594 patients positive for COVID-19 and 100 samples from pre-COVID cases were tested by three automated platforms: Abbott architect i2000SR, Roche cobas e411 and Yhlo iFlash 1800 and their diagnostic accuracy were compared. All three platforms showed high specificity as claimed by manufacturer. Clinical sensitivities of the machines were calculated as 64.48% (58.67-70.3) for Abbott, 80.48% (76.62-84.34) for Roche and 76.94% (72.65-81.23) for Yhlo.

This cross-sectional study assessed 284 patients recruited from a tertiary hospital. Patients completed a web-based survey on socio-demographic data, past medical\/psychiatric history, and additional information relevant to the outbreak conditions. The psychiatric status was assessed using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the acute symptom burden and protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of 50 days following the diagnosis of COVID-19, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and\/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s), with fatigue, muscle aches, alteration of smell\/taste, headache and difficulty in concentration, being the most common symptoms reported. Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, perceived stigmatization, and a negative view on the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the presence of protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients may be prone to substantial psychological distress in the first months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were also frequent in this period, and these were related to the posttraumatic psychiatric morbidity. Both the psychiatric morbidity and the protracted symptoms were independent of the initial infection severity. Further research on the neurobiological commonalities between the protracted symptoms and PTSD in COVID-19 patients is warranted.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Burc Cagri Poyraz","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Cana Aksoy Poyraz","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Yesim Olgun","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Ozge Gurel","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Sena Alkan","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Yusuf Emre Ozdemir","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Ilker Inanc Balkan","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Ridvan Karaali","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Subrata Kumar Palo","author_inst":"ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Jyotirmayee Turuk","author_inst":"ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Sanghamitra Pati","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Debdutta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"ICMR - Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Margaux Hales","author_inst":"NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Monir Ejemel","author_inst":"MassBiologics"},{"author_name":"Qi Li","author_inst":"MassBiologics"},{"author_name":"Yang Wang","author_inst":"MassBiologics"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Mantis","author_inst":"NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Kathleen A.

On the issue of testing sensitivity and accuracy, RT-PCR is commonly viewed as a standard testing protocol globally as the predominant accurate testing method as opposed to other rapid testing methods. However, each country's infectious disease authority has established its own primers\/probe sets guidelines and protocols, thereby, the global testing community lacks a \"Standardized Universal Primer(s)\" (SUP) that is foolproof for the COVID-19 patients among various populations today. As a result, RT-PCR testing accuracy and results may vary depending on which primer was used, most likely resulting in false negative and\/or false positive calls associated with RT-PCR testing. In this study, a comparative study between primers from different countries' disease control centers was conducted. 11,652 samples from Japanese population were tested for SARS-CoV-2 positive using recommended RT-PCR primers\/probe sets from Japan National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results: Of the 102 positive samples, 17 samples (16.7% of total positives) showed inconsistent results when tested for the following primers: JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2. In addition, CDC recommended primer\/probe sets showed relatively higher sensitivity and accuracy among the primer\/probe sets used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive clones. Conclusion: Due to the inconsistency in the positive\/negative results for JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2 primer\/probe sets, SARS-CoV-2 samples run via RT-PCR will result in false negative\/positive subjected to differences in virus mutation in a specific sequence region targeted by a primer. This outcome shows that the use of JPN-N2 primer combined with CDC-N2 primer produces the most effective result to reduce false negatives in Japan region. Furthermore, adding CDC-N1 will result in reducing false negatives, but also false positives. Further investigation remains open for confirmation whether similar irregular pattern occur with primers targeting other regions such as E or ORF1ab in order to isolate false negatives and\/or positives in future PCR testing for COVID-19.

Transport ventilators requiring only O2 source may be used to deliver volume-controlled ventilation. Objective: To evaluate the performances of four transport ventilators compared to an ICU ventilator simulating severe respiratory conditions. Materials and methods: Two pneumatic transport ventilators, (Oxylog 3000, Draeger; Osiris 3, Air Liquide Medical Systems) and two turbine transport ventilators (Elisee 350, ResMed; Monnal T60, Air Liquide Medical Systems) were compared to an ICU ventilator (Engstrom Carestation - GE Healthcare) using a Michigan training test lung. We tested each ventilator with different set volumes Vtset (350, 450, 550 ml) and different compliances (20 or 50 ml\/cmH2O) and a resistance of 15 cmH20\/L\/sec based on values recently described in COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Volume error was measured, as well as the trigger time delay during assist-control ventilation simulating spontaneous breathing activity with a P0.1 of 4 cmH20. Results: Grouping all conditions, the volume error was 2.9 +\/- 2.2 % for Engstrom Carestation; 3.6 +\/- 3.9 % for Osiris 3; 2.5 +\/- 2.1 % for Oxylog 3000; 5.4 +\/- 2.7 % for Monnal T60 and 8.8 +\/- 4.8 % for Elisee 350. Grouping all conditions, trigger delay was 42 +\/- 4 ms, 65 +\/- 5 ms, 151 +\/- 14 ms, 51 +\/- 6 and 64 +\/- 5 ms for Engstrom Carestation, Osiris 3, Oxylog 3000, Monnal T60 and Elisee 350, respectively. Conclusions: In special surge situations such as COVID-19 pandemic, most transport ventilators may be used to safely deliver volume-controlled ventilation in locations where only oxygen pressure supply is available with acceptable volume accuracy. Performances regarding triggering function are generally acceptable but vary across ventilators.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dominique Savary","author_inst":"-\tEmergency Department, Angers University Hospital, Angers, France                   -\tInserm, EHESP, University of Rennes, Irset (Institut de recherche en sant"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Lesimple","author_inst":"- CNRS, INSERM 1083, MITOVASC, Angers University Hospital               -\tMed2Lab, ALMS, Antony, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Beloncle","author_inst":"MD, Critical Care Department, Angers University Hospital, Angers, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Morin","author_inst":"MD, Emergency Department, Angers University Hospital, Angers, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Templier","author_inst":"MD, Emergency Department, Angers University Hospital, Angers, France"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Broc","author_inst":"the Telecom-Physic-Strasbourg, Strasbourg University France"},{"author_name":"Laurent Brochard","author_inst":"- Keenan Resarch Centre for Biomedical Science, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada                              -\tInterdep"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe Richard","author_inst":"-\tCritical Care Department, Angers University Hospital, Angers, France                     -\tINSERM UMR 955 Eq13"},{"author_name":"Alain Mercat","author_inst":"MD, PHD, Critical Care Department, Angers University Hospital, Angers, France"},{"author_name":"Akihiro Sekine","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sanghamitra Pati","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Debdutta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"ICMR - Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Margaux Hales","author_inst":"NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Monir Ejemel","author_inst":"MassBiologics"},{"author_name":"Qi Li","author_inst":"MassBiologics"},{"author_name":"Yang Wang","author_inst":"MassBiologics"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Mantis","author_inst":"NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Kathleen A.

Models can provide insights into the efficacy of contact tracing, coupled with isolating or quarantining at risk people. Methods: We developed an agent-based model and simulated 15, 000 short term illnesses, with varying characteristics. For each illness we ran ten simulations on the following scenarios: (1) No tracing or isolation (None), (2) isolation of agents who have tested positive (Isolation), (3) scenario 2 coupled with minimal contact tracing and quarantine of contacts (Minimum), (4) scenario 3 with more effective contact tracing (Moderate), and (5) perfect isolation of agents who test positive and perfect tracing and quarantine of all their contacts (Maximum). Results: The median total infections of the Isolation, Minimum, Moderate and Maximum scenarios were 80%, 40%, 17% and 4% of the no intervention scenario respectively. Conclusions: Isolation of infected patients and quarantine of their contacts, even if moderately well implemented, is likely to substantially reduce the number of infections in an outbreak.

People living in precarious conditions were relocated by the authorities to emergency shelters, hotels and large venues. Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) then intervened to provide medical care in several of these locations in Paris and in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of its suburbs, between March and June 2020. A seroprevalence survey was conducted to assess the level of exposure to COVID-19 among the population living in the sites. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the impact of the pandemic on populations living in insecure conditions in Europe. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in the food distribution sites, emergency shelters and workers residences supported by MSF in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis, to determine the extent of COVID-19 exposure as determined by SARS-CoV2 antibody seropositivity. The detection of SARS-COV2 antibodies in serum was performed at the Institut Pasteur of Paris using two LuLISA (Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) assays and a Pseudo Neutralization Test. A questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions, adherence to sanitary recommendations and symptom manifestations was also completed. We describe here the seroprevalence site by site and identify the risk factors for seropositivity using a multivariable logistic regression model with site random effects. We also investigated associations between seropositivity and symptoms eventually reported. Findings Overall, 426\/818 individuals tested positive in the 14 sites investigated. Seroprevalence varied significantly with the type of site (chi2 p<0.001). It was highest at 88.7% (95%CI 81.8-93.2) among individuals living in workers residences, followed by 50.5% (95%CI 46.3-54.7) in emergency shelters and 27.8 % (95%CI 20.8-35.7) among individuals recruited from the food distribution sites. Seroprevalence also varied significantly between sites of the same type. Among other risk factors, the odds for seropositivity were higher among individuals living in crowded sites (medium: adj. OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.5-5.1, p=0.001; high: adj. OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.7-6.9, p<0.001) compared with individuals from low crowding sites and among those who reported transit accommodation in a gymnasium before the lockdown (adj. OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.2-8.1, p=0.023). More than two-thirds of the seropositive individuals (68.3%; 95%CI 64.2-72.2) did not report any symptoms during the recall period. Interpretation The results demonstrate rather high exposure to SARS-COV-2 with important variations between study sites. Living in crowded conditions was identified as the most important explanatory factor for differences in levels of exposure. This study describes the key factors which determine the risk of exposure and illustrates the importance of identifying populations at high risk of exposure in order to orient and adapt prevention and control strategies to their specific needs.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas ROEDERER","author_inst":"Epicentre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Bastien MOLLO","author_inst":"Medecins Sans Frontieres, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Charline VINCENT","author_inst":"Medecins Sans Frontieres, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Birgit NIKOLAY","author_inst":"Epicentre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Augusto LLOSA","author_inst":"Epicentre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robin NESBITT","author_inst":"Epicentre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jessica VANHOMWEGEN","author_inst":"Environment and Infectious Risks Research and Expertise Unit, Global Health Department, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Thierry ROSE","author_inst":"Unit of Lymphocyte Cell Biology, Immunology Department, Institut Pasteur, INSERM 1221, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Francois ANNA","author_inst":"Unit of Molecular Virology and Vaccinology, Virology Department, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Corinne TORRE","author_inst":"Medecins Sans Frontieres, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Emilie FOURREY","author_inst":"Medecins Sans Frontieres, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie GOYARD","author_inst":"Unit of Lymphocyte Cell Biology, Immunology Department, Institut Pasteur, INSERM 1221, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Yves JANIN","author_inst":"Unit of Chemistry and Biocatalysis, Institut Pasteur, UMR 3523 CNRS, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre CHARNEAU","author_inst":"Unit of Molecular Virology and Vaccinology, Virology Department, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Oxana VRATSKIKH","author_inst":"Environment and Infectious Risks Research and Expertise Unit, Global Health Department, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anneliese COURY","author_inst":"Medecins Sans Frontieres, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Stefan VANEL","author_inst":"Medecins Sans Frontieres, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre MENDIHARAT","author_inst":"Medecins Sans Frontieres, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Klaudia PORTEN","author_inst":"Epicentre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"William HENNEQUIN","author_inst":"Medecins Sans Frontieres, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Clair MILLS","author_inst":"Medecins Sans Frontieres, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco LUQUERO","author_inst":"Epicentre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Young Lee","author_inst":"Altimmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Bethlehem Shiberu","author_inst":"Altimmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Vyjayanthi Krishnan","author_inst":"Altimmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Isabelle Peguillet","author_inst":"Altimmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Zhang","author_inst":"Altimmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Todd Green","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Troy D.

Recent reports suggest that both clinical and genetic risk factors may contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To investigate genetic risk factors, we collected over 500,000 COVID-19 survey responses between April and May 2020 with accompanying genetic data from the AncestryDNA database. We conducted sex-stratified and meta-analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for COVID-19 susceptibility (positive nasopharyngeal swab test, ncases=2,407) and severity (hospitalization, ncases=250). The severity GWAS replicated associations with severe COVID-19 near ABO and SLC6A20 (P<0.05). Furthermore, we identified three novel loci with P<5x10-8. The strongest association was near IVNS1ABP, a gene involved in influenza virus replication, and was associated only in males. The other two novel loci harbor genes with established roles in viral replication or immunity: SRRM1 and the immunoglobulin lambda locus. We thus present new evidence that host genetic variation likely contributes to COVID-19 outcomes and demonstrate the value of large-scale, self-reported data as a mechanism to rapidly address a health crisis.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Genevieve H.L.

Our modelling aims to inform optimal public health responses. Methods An individual-based simulation model represented communities ranging from 100 to 3,500 people, comprised of large interconnected households. A range of strategies for case finding, quarantining of contacts, testing, and lockdown were examined, following the silent introduction of a case. Results Multiple secondary infections are likely present by the time the first case is identified. Quarantine of close contacts, defined by extended household membership, can reduce peak infection prevalence from 60-70% to around 10%, but subsequent waves may occur when community mixing resumes. Exit testing significantly reduces ongoing transmission. Concurrent lockdown of non-quarantined households for 14 days is highly effective for epidemic control and reduces overall testing requirements; peak prevalence of the initial outbreak can be constrained to less than 5%, and the final community attack rate to less than 10% in modelled scenarios. Lockdown also mitigates the effect of a delay in the initial response. Compliance with lockdown must be at least 80-90%, however, or epidemic control will be lost. Conclusions A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will spread rapidly in remote communities. Prompt case detection with quarantining of extended-household contacts and a 14-day lockdown for all other residents, combined with exit testing for all, is the most effective strategy for rapid containment. Compliance is crucial, underscoring the need for community supported, culturally sensitive responses.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ben B Hui","author_inst":"Kirby Institute, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"Damien Brown","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and The University of Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Rebecca H Chisholm","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, La Trobe University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Geard","author_inst":"School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory Epidemiology Unit, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and T"},{"author_name":"David G Regan","author_inst":"Kirby Institute, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"Brooke Rhead","author_inst":"AncestryDNA, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Miao Zhang","author_inst":"AncestryDNA, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Nathan Berkowitz","author_inst":"AncestryDNA, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"AncestryDNA Science Team","author_inst":"AncestryDNA, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Asher K.

The SIQR model, which is an improvement on the conventional SIR model, is unique in that it allows us to theoretically clarify the epidemic phenomenon by separating the number of daily confirmed new cases by testing and the number of infecteds at large who remain untested, and also allows us to theoretically consider measures to control the epidemic. The infection control measures of each country were analyzed by dividing them into three groups according to the size of the decay (or growth) rate of infected at large ({lambda}). The active group includes China and South Korea, the passive group includes the United States and Sweden, and the average group includes Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and Japan. China and South Korea are the countries with the best testing and quarantine systems, and South Korea in particular having managed to contain the infection without lockdown through early quarantine by thorough testing. On the other hand, the United States and Sweden do not have a well-developed inspection and quarantine system and have shown little restraint in social distancing. In the case of Japan, the following special factors may have contributed to the extreme lack of PCR testing : (1) The \"4-day fever rule\" established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare was strictly enforced. (2) Even after the decision to postpone the Olympics, the government continued to monopolize PCR testing for the sake of unified analysis of infection data, and the policy of expanding PCR testing by private companies was not implemented.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"suda reiji","author_inst":"green energy site"},{"author_name":"Damien Brown","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and The University of Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Rebecca H Chisholm","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, La Trobe University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Geard","author_inst":"School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory Epidemiology Unit, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and T"},{"author_name":"David G Regan","author_inst":"Kirby Institute, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"Brooke Rhead","author_inst":"AncestryDNA, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Miao Zhang","author_inst":"AncestryDNA, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Nathan Berkowitz","author_inst":"AncestryDNA, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"AncestryDNA Science Team","author_inst":"AncestryDNA, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Asher K.

DESIGN Living systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Eligible publications identified from >500 databases indexed through 31st July 2020 and additional studies from reference lists, with planned continual surveillance for at least two years. STUDY SELECTION Observational and interventional studies that report on the association between cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION Single-reviewer extraction and quality evaluation (using ROBINS-I), with half the records independently extracted and evaluated by a second reviewer. RESULTS Of 23,427 titles screened, 175 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. The most reported drug classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with ACEI\/ARB exposure being associated with higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled unadjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.30). Among patients with COVID-19, unadjusted estimates showed that ACEI\/ARB exposure was associated with being hospitalized (OR 2.25, 1.70 to 2.98) and having severe disease (OR 1.50, 1.27 to 1.77) but not with the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.45, -1.33 to 0.43 days) or all-cause mortality (OR 1.25, CI 0.98 to 1.58). However, after adjustment, ACEI\/ARB exposure was not associated with testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled adjusted OR 1.01, 0.93 to 1.10), being hospitalized (OR 1.16, 0.80 to 1.68), having severe disease (1.04, 0.76 to 1.42), or all-cause mortality (0.86, 0.64 to 1.15). Similarly, subgroup analyses involving only hypertensive patients revealed that ACEI\/ARB exposure was not associated with being hospitalized (OR 0.84, 0.58 to 1.22), disease severity (OR 0.88, 0.68 to 1.14) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.77, 0.54 to 1.12) while it decreased the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.71, -1.11 to -0.30 days). After adjusting for relevant covariates, other cardiovascular drug classes were mostly not found to be associated with poor COVID-19 clinical outcomes. However, the validity of these findings is limited by a high level of heterogeneity in terms of effect sizes and a serious risk of bias, mainly due to confounding in the included studies. CONCLUSION Our comprehensive review shows that ACEI\/ARB exposure is associated with COVID-19 outcomes such as susceptibility to infection, severity, and hospitalization in unadjusted analyses. However, after adjusting for potential confounding factors, this association is not evident. Patients on cardiovascular drugs should continue taking their medications as currently recommended. Higher quality evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine any adverse or beneficial effects of cardiovascular drugs.

Transmission tends to be more effective in select settings that involve exposure to relatively high viral dose, such as in crowded indoor settings, assisted living facilities, prisons, or food processing plants. To explore the effect on infection dynamics, we describe a new mathematical model where transmission can occur (i) in the community at large, characterized by low dose exposure and mostly mild disease, and (ii) in so called transmission hot zones, characterized by high dose exposure that can be associated with more severe disease. Interestingly, we find that successful infection spread can hinge upon high-dose hot zone transmission, yet the majority of infections are predicted to occur in the community at large with mild disease. This gives rise to the prediction that targeted interventions that specifically reduce virus transmission in the hot zones (but not in the community at large) have the potential to suppress overall infection spread, including in the community at large. The model can further reconcile seemingly contradicting epidemiological observations. While in some locations like California, strict stay-home orders failed to significantly reduce infection prevalence, in other locations, such as New York and several European countries, stay-home orders lead to a pronounced fall in infection levels, which remained suppressed for some months after re-opening of society. Differences in hot zone transmission levels during and after social distancing interventions can account for these diverging infection patterns. These modeling results warrant further epidemiological investigations into the role of high dose hot zone transmission for the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 spread.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dominik Wodarz","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Natalia L.

Our objective was to compare epidemiological characteristics and outcomes between patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 and those who did not, admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic. Methods This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program. Results We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62{+\/-}17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred. Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV requirement, diabetes and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective factor. Conclusions Our study suggests that the administration of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the hospital might be associated with decreased mortality.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin R Salazar","author_inst":"Teaching and Research Service, San Martin Hospital, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Soledad E Gonzalez","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Lorena Regairaz","author_inst":"Immunology Unit.

Research Design and Methods: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat) across China. It was completed by 10,545 adults in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables, adjusting for covariates. Results: Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among patients with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with T2DM tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting T2DM and 8.0% without T2DM). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with T2DM experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without T2DM (22.7 % and 25.8%, respectively). Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate. Conclusions: T2DM was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zumin Shi","author_inst":"Human Nutrition Department, College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Alice Yan","author_inst":"Center for Advancing Population Science, Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA"},{"author_name":"Paul Zimmet","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Sun","author_inst":"Global Health Institute, School of Public Health, Xian Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xian, China"},{"author_name":"Nayla Cristina do Vale Moreira","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Ceara (FAMED-UFC), Brazil"},{"author_name":"Lawrence J Cheskin","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 220030, USA"},{"author_name":"Liming Wang","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Non-communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Weidong Qu","author_inst":"Centers for Water and Health, Key Laboratory of the Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Fu"},{"author_name":"Hong Yan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China"},{"author_name":"Akhtar Hussain","author_inst":"Faculty of Health Sciences, Nord University, Norway; International Diabetes Federation. 166 Chaussee de La Hulpe B-1170, Brussels, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Youfa Wang","author_inst":"Global Health Institute, School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China"},{"author_name":"Harendra Guturu","author_inst":"AncestryDNA, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Ahna R.

Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence studies, vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a microfluidic nano-immunnoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultra-low volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 L whole blood easily obtainable from a simple fingerprick. The nano-immunoassay platform achieves high-throughput, high sensitivity and specificity, negligible reagent consumption, and a decentralized and simple approach to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be immediately applicable to current and future SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker diagnostics in general.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zoe Swank","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Gr\u00e9goire Michielin","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Hon Ming Yip","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Patrick Cohen","author_inst":"University of Geneva Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Diego O.

In this regard, we and others recently reported that the neutralization activity of plasma from COVID-19 patients decreases rapidly during the first weeks after recovery. However, the specific role of each immunoglobulin isotype in the overall neutralizing capacity is still not well understood. In this study, we selected plasma from a cohort of Covid-19 convalescent patients and selectively depleted immunoglobulin A, M or G before testing the remaining neutralizing capacity of the depleted plasma. We found that depletion of immunoglobulin M was associated with the most substantial loss of virus neutralization, followed by immunoglobulin G. This observation may help design efficient antibody-based COVID-19 therapies and may also explain the increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of autoimmune patients receiving therapies that impair the production of IgM.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Romain Gasser","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Marc Cloutier","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Jeremie Prevost","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Corby Fink","author_inst":"University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Eric Ducas","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Shilei Ding","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Dussault","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Patricia Landry","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Tony Tremblay","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Audrey Laforce-Lavoie","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Antoine Lewin","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussieres","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Laumaea","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Halima Medjahed","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Catherine Larochelle","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Richard","author_inst":"Centre de Recherche du CHUM"},{"author_name":"Gregory A Dekaban","author_inst":"University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Jimmy D Dikeakos","author_inst":"University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Renee Bazin","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Andres Finzi","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Clair MILLS","author_inst":"Medecins Sans Frontieres, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco LUQUERO","author_inst":"Epicentre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Young Lee","author_inst":"Altimmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Bethlehem Shiberu","author_inst":"Altimmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Vyjayanthi Krishnan","author_inst":"Altimmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Isabelle Peguillet","author_inst":"Altimmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Zhang","author_inst":"Altimmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Todd Green","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Troy D.
