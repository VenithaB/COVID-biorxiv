To better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and build up the host anti-viral immunity, we examined the levels of ACE2 expression on different types of immune cells including tissue macrophages. Flow cytometry demonstrated that there was little to no expression of ACE2 on most of the human peripheral blood-derived immune cells including CD4+ T, CD8+ T, activated CD4+ T, activated CD8+ T, CD4+CD25+CD127low\/- regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th17 cells, NKT cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and granulocytes. Additionally, there was no ACE2 expression (< 1%) found on platelets. Compared with interleukin-4-treated type 2 macrophages (M2), the ACE2 expression was markedly increased on the activated type 1 macrophages (M1) after the stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that high expressions of ACE2 were colocalized with tissue macrophages, such as alveolar macrophages found within the lungs and Kupffer cells within livers of mice. Flow cytometry confirmed the very low level of ACE2 expression on human primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. These data indicate that alveolar macrophages, as the frontline immune cells, may be directly targeted by the SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore need to be considered for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiang Song","author_inst":"Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack Meridian Health"},{"author_name":"Wei Hu","author_inst":"Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack Meridian Health"},{"author_name":"Haibo Yu","author_inst":"Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack Meridian Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Zhao","author_inst":"Tianhe Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc"},{"author_name":"Yeqian Zhao","author_inst":"Tianhe Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack Meridian Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20151878","rel_title":"Inverted covariate effects for mutated 2nd vs 1st waveCovid-19: high temperature spread biased for young","rel_date":"2020-07-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20151878","rel_abs":"(1) Background: Here, we characterize COVID-19 2nd waves, following a study presenting negative associations between 1st wave COVID-19 spread parameters and temperature; (2) Methods: Visual examinations of daily increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases in 124 countries, determined 1st and 2nd waves in 28 countries; (3) Results: 1st wave spread rate increases with country mean elevation, temperature, time since wave onset, and median age. Spread rates decrease above 1000m, indicating high UV decrease spread rate. For 2nd waves, associations are opposite: viruses adapted to high temperature and to infect young populations. Earliest 2nd waves started April 5-7 at mutagenic high elevations (Armenia, Algeria). 2nd waves occurred also at warm-to-cold season transition (Argentina, Chile). Spread decreases in most (77%) countries. Death-to-total case ratios decrease during the 2nd wave, also when comparing with the same period for countries where the 1st wave is ongoing. In countries with late 1st wave onset, spread rates fit better 2nd than 1st wave-temperature patterns; In countries with ageing populations (examples: Japan, Sweden, Ukraine), 2nd waves only adapted to spread at higher temperatures, not to infect children.

To aid global efforts focusing on SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting, we report exploratory results from frameshifting and cellular replication experiments with locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which support the FSE as a therapeutic target but highlight difficulties in achieving strong inactivation. To understand current limitations, we applied cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and the Ribosolve7 pipeline to determine a three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE, validated through an RNA nanostructure tagging method.

We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 M, leading to more than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) as well as Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid (leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at 300 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEO_LIMTX is one of the earliest cancer drugs to be developed, giving rise to seven decades of clinical experience. It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines, can be administered orally or parenterally, and its costs are at single digit {euro} or $ amounts\/day for standard treatment. In case of its successful further preclinical evaluation for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, its repurposing to treat COVID-19 would thus be feasible, especially under low-resource conditions.\nC_LIO_LIAdditional drugs exist to interfere with the synthesis of nucleotides, e.g. additional folate antagonists, inhibitors of GMP synthetase, or inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Such inhibitors have been approved as drugs for different purposes and might represent further therapeutic options against infections with SARS-CoV-2\nC_LIO_LIRemdesivir is currently the most established drug for treating COVID-19. Our results argue that MTX and remdesivir, even at moderate concentrations, can act in a synergistic fashion to repress virus replication to a considerably greater extent than either drug alone.\nC_LIO_LICOVID-19, in its severe forms, is characterized by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and additional organ involvements. These manifestations are not necessarily a direct consequence of virus replication and cytopathic effects, but rather a result of an uncontrolled inflammatory and immune response. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids are thus being evaluated for treating COVID-19. However, this bears the risk of re-activating virus spread by suppressing a sufficient and specific immune response. In this situation, it is tempting to speculate that MTX might suppress both excessive inflammation as well as virus replication at the same time, thus limiting both the pathogenesis of pneumonia and also the spread of virus within a patient.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kim M Stegmann","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Antje Dickmanns","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Gerber","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Vella Nikolova","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Luisa Klemke","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Valentina Manzini","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Denise Schloesser","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Cathrin Bierwirth","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Julia Freund","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Maren Sitte","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Raimond Lugert","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Salinas","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Dirk Goerlich","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Bernd Wollnik","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Uwe Gross","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Matthias Dobbelstein","author_inst":"University Medical Center Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S.

However, currently available applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID-19 epidemic spatiotemporally, due to functional limitations That motivated us to develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables people to dissect epidemiological consequences via interactive node filters to provide spatiotemporal perspectives on multimodal spectra of infectious diseases, including introduction, outbreak, expansion, and containment, for given regions and time spans.

Here, we show that a very general class of allosteric protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2. Using broadly applicable design principles, we allosterically couple binding of protein analytes of interest to the reconstitution of luciferase activity and a bioluminescent readout through the association of designed lock and key proteins. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to switch activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the hIgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-19 3, we use the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder, has a limit of detection of 15pM with an up to seventeen fold increase in luminescence upon addition of RBD. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alfredo Quijano-Rubio","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Hsien-Wei Yeh","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jooyoung Park","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Hansol Lee","author_inst":"KAIST Institute for the Biocentury"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

Understanding various aspects of SARS-CoV2 biology, virulence and pathogenesis as well as determinants of immune response have become a global research priority. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses on SAR-CoV2 protein sequences, trying to unravel biologically important similarities between this newly emerged virus with other RNA viruses. Comparing the proteome of SARS-CoV2 with major positive and negative strand ssRNA viruses showed significant homologies between SARS-CoV2 spike protein with pathogenic paramyxovirus fusion proteins. This  spike-fusion homology was not limited to SARS-CoV2 and it existed for some other pathogenic coronaviruses; nonetheless, SARS-CoV2 spike-fusion homology was orders of magnitude stronger than homologies observed for other known coronaviruses. Moreover, this homology did not seem to be a consequence of general ssRNA virus phylogenetic relations. We also explored potential immunological significance of this spike-fusion homology. Spike protein epitope analysis using experimentally verified data deposited in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) revealed that the majority of spikes T cell epitopes as well as many B cell and MHC binding epitopes map within the spike-fusion homology region. Overall, our data indicate that there might be a relation between SARS-CoV2 and paramyxoviruses at the level of their surface proteins and this relation could be of crucial immunological importance.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ehsan Ahmadi","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Reza Zabihi","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ramin Hosseinzadeh","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Farshid Noorbakhsh","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

These results support the interpretation of the lack of conservation of the HIV-1 gene and that the number of existing polymorphisms, only for this structure of the complex, implies the non-efficiency of a drug at population levels.

The 64 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh belonged to three clusters.

Among these, 99 missense mutations (90%) were predicted to destabilize protein structures.

The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493, and serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494. Substitutions at positions positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and the earlier, closely related SARS-CoV virus bind at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor at the cell surface. The higher human infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to its stronger affinity for hACE2. Here, we study by computational methods complexes of hACE2 with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of viruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We identify residues affecting the affinities of the two domains for hACE2. We also propose mutations at key SARS-CoV-2 positions, which might enhance hACE2 affinity. Such mutations may appear in viral strains with increased human infectivity and might assist the design of peptide-based compounds that inhibit infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Savvas Polydorides","author_inst":"University of Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Georgios Archontis","author_inst":"University of Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Shah M Faruque","author_inst":"Independent University, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Farshid Noorbakhsh","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to the response capacity of hospitals at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael H.

The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unclear, but developing strategies for mitigating the severity of the pandemic is yet a top priority for global public health. In this study, we developed a novel compartmental model, SEIR-CV(susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed with control variables), which not only considers the key characteristics of asymptomatic infection and the effects of seasonal variations, but also incorporates different control measures for multiple transmission routes, so as to accurately predict and effectively control the spread of COVID-19. Based on SEIR-CV, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic situation in China out of Hubei province and proposed corresponding control strategies. The results showed that the prediction results are highly consistent with the outbreak surveillance data, which proved that the proposed control strategies have achieved sound consequent in the actual epidemic control. Subsequently, we have conducted a rolling prediction for the United States, Brazil, India, five European countries (the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France), southern hemisphere, northern hemisphere, and the world out of China. The results indicate that control measures and seasonal variations have a great impact on the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our prediction results show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing more rapidly due to the impact of the cold season in the southern hemisphere countries such as Brazil. While the development of the pandemic should have gradually weakened in the northern hemisphere countries with the arrival of the warm season, instead of still developing rapidly due to the relative loose control measures such as the United States and India. Furthermore, the prediction results illustrate that if keeping the current control measures in the main COVID-19 epidemic countries, the pandemic will not be contained and the situation may eventually turn to group immunization, which would lead to the extremely severe disaster of about 5 billion infections and 300 million deaths globally. However, if China's super stringent control measures were implemented from 15 July, 15 August or 15 September 2020, the total infections would be contained about 15 million, 32 million or 370 million respectively, which indicates that the stringent and timely control measures is critical, and the best window period is before September for eventually overcoming COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shunxiang Huang","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China"},{"author_name":"Li Xu","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Aihong Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Li Sheng","author_inst":"National Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Pure Blue Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing 100085, China"},{"author_name":"Long Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Rongzhang Hao","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China"},{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"school of energy and environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096"},{"author_name":"Sheng Fang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100071, China."},{"author_name":"Yingru Li","author_inst":"Materials Institute, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, Sichuan 621908, China"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chan Lu","author_inst":"XiangYa School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China"},{"author_name":"Qihong Deng","author_inst":"XiangYa School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S.

Current surveillance protocols generally focus on qualitative impact assessments of viral diversity. These efforts are primarliy aimed at ecosystem and human impact monitoring, and do not help to precisely quantify emergence. Currently, the similarity of biological strains is measured by the edit distance or the number of mutations that separate their genomic sequences, e.g. the number of mutations that make an avian flu strain human-adapted. However, ignoring the odds of those mutations in the wild keeps us blind to the true jump risk, and gives us little indication of which strains are more risky. In this study, we develop a more meaningful metric for comparison of genomic sequences. Our metric, the q-distance, precisely quantifies the probability of spontaneous jump by random chance. Learning from patterns of mutations from large sequence databases, the q-distance adapts to the specific organism, the background population, and realistic selection pressures; demonstrably improving inference of ancestral relationships and future trajectories. As important application, we show that the q-distance predicts future strains for seasonal Influenza, outperforming World Health Organization (WHO) recommended flu-shot composition almost consistently over two decades. Such performance is demonstrated separately for Northern and Southern hemisphere for different subtypes, and key capsidic proteins. Additionally, we investigate the SARS-CoV2 origin problem, and precisely quantify the likelihood of different animal species that hosted an immediate progenitor, producing a list of related species of bats that have a quantifiably high likelihood of being the source. Additionally, we identify specific rodents with a credible likelihood of hosting a SARS-CoV2 ancestor. Combining machine learning and large deviation theory, the analysis reported here may open the door to actionable predictions of future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin Li","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Timmy Li","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Ishanu Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"University Of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Aihong Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Li Sheng","author_inst":"National Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Pure Blue Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing 100085, China"},{"author_name":"Long Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Rongzhang Hao","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China"},{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"school of energy and environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096"},{"author_name":"Sheng Fang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100071, China."},{"author_name":"Yingru Li","author_inst":"Materials Institute, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, Sichuan 621908, China"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chan Lu","author_inst":"XiangYa School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China"},{"author_name":"Qihong Deng","author_inst":"XiangYa School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S.

Here, we describe a novel application of biolayer interferometry for the rapid detection of antigen-specific antibody levels in plasma samples, and demonstrate its utility for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Our biolayer interferometry immunosorbent assay (BLI-ISA) utilizes single-use biosensors in an automated \"dip-and-read\" format, providing real-time optical measurements of antigen loading, plasma antibody binding, and antibody isotype detection. Complete quantitative results are obtained in less than 20 minutes. BLI-ISA meets or exceeds the performance of high complexity methods such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Chemiluminescent Immunoassay. Importantly, our method can be immediately implemented on existing BLI platforms for urgent COVID-19 studies, such as serosurveillance and the evaluation of vaccine candidates. In a broader sense, BLI-ISA can be developed as a novel diagnostic platform to evaluate antibodies and other biomolecules in clinical specimens.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John V Dzimianski","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lorig-Roach","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Sara M O'Rourke","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"David L Alexander","author_inst":"Ontera Inc."},{"author_name":"Jacqueline M Kimmey","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Rebecca M DuBois","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Long Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Rongzhang Hao","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China"},{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"school of energy and environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096"},{"author_name":"Sheng Fang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100071, China."},{"author_name":"Yingru Li","author_inst":"Materials Institute, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, Sichuan 621908, China"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chan Lu","author_inst":"XiangYa School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China"},{"author_name":"Qihong Deng","author_inst":"XiangYa School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S.

However, Bluetooth attenuation is not a reliable measure of distance, and infection risk is not a binary function of distance, nor duration, nor timing. Methods: We model uncertainty in the shape and orientation of an exhaled virus-containing plume and in inhalation parameters, and measure uncertainty in distance as a function of Bluetooth attenuation. We calculate expected dose by combining this with estimated infectiousness based on timing relative to symptom onset. We calibrate an exponential dose-response curve on the basis of the infection probabilities of household contacts. The conditional probability of current or future infectiousness, conditioned on how long post-exposure an exposed individual has been free of symptoms, decreases during quarantine, with shape determined by the distribution of incubation periods, proportion of asymptomatic cases, and distribution of asymptomatic shedding durations. It can be adjusted for negative test results using Bayes Theorem. Findings: We capture a 10-fold range of risk using 6 infectiousness values, 11-fold range using 3 Bluetooth attenuation bins, ~6-fold range from exposure duration given the 30 minute duration cap imposed by the Google\/Apple v1.1, and ~11-fold between the beginning and end of 14 day quarantine. Imposing a consistent risk threshold for the probability of infection can recommend quarantine with weaker Bluetooth signal, even when not recommended for the entirety of the infectious period. Interpretation: The Covid-Watch app is currently programmed either to use a threshold on initial infection risk to determine 14-day quarantine onset, or on the conditional probability of current and future infectiousness conditions to determine both quarantine and duration. Either threshold can be set by public health authorities.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda M Wilson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Nathan Aviles","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James I Petrie","author_inst":"Covid Watch"},{"author_name":"Paloma I Beamer","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Zsombor Szabo","author_inst":"Covid-Watch"},{"author_name":"Michelle Xie","author_inst":"Covid Watch"},{"author_name":"Janet McIllece","author_inst":"World Wide Technology"},{"author_name":"Yijie Chen","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Young-Jun Son","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sameer Halai","author_inst":"Covid Watch"},{"author_name":"Tina White","author_inst":"Covid Watch"},{"author_name":"Kacey C Ernst","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Joanna Masel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Anupama Tiwari","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center, Albany NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marc A.

Ninety-one patients were SARS-CoV2 PCR+ with 63% being male and a median age of 60. Cardiovascular disease was a significant comorbidity in the PCR+ group. Fever, cough, dyspnea, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, headache and myalgias were significantly more common in that group, as was an elevated CRP, LDH, serum ferritin and transaminases. Overall survival of the COVID-19 patients was 88%, 77% in the critically ill, 59% of those mechanically ventilated and 33% of those requiring new dialysis. Survival was 93% in those not receiving any antivirals. Survival of those treated with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin was 92%, compared to 86% of those treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. The latter two groups were significantly more ill than the untreated group. A transition from an early intubation strategy to aggressive utilization of high flow nasal cannula and noninvasive ventilation(i.e BiPAP) was successful in freeing up ICU resources.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel E McGrail","author_inst":"His Hands Free Clinic"},{"author_name":"Dianna Edwards","author_inst":"Unity Point St. Luke's Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Hillyard","author_inst":"ARUP Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Nikki Gilmore","author_inst":"University of Utah Hospital and Clinics"},{"author_name":"John W Barrett","author_inst":"University of Utah Hospital and Clinics"},{"author_name":"Richard R Orlandi","author_inst":"University of Utah Hospital and Clinics"},{"author_name":"Salika Mehreen Shakir","author_inst":"University of Utah and ARUP Laboratories"},{"author_name":"G\u00e9raldine Blanchard-Rohner","author_inst":"Childrens Hospital of Geneva, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Natasha Loevy","author_inst":"Childrens Hospital of Geneva, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"University of Geneva Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Jacquerioz","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"University Hospitals of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Joanna Masel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Anupama Tiwari","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center, Albany NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marc A.

This emergent effect in pandemic dynamics instantiates \"Parrondo's Paradox,\" -- an entity comprised of distinct but interacting units can behave qualitatively differently than each part on its own.

We aimed to characterize the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Qatar. Methods: A series of epidemiologic studies were conducted including analysis of the national SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and hospitalization database, community surveys assessing current infection, ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas, serological testing for antibody on blood specimens collected for routine clinical screening\/management, national Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) death registry, and a mathematical model. Results: By July 10, 397,577 individuals had been PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 110,986 were positive, a positivity cumulative rate of 27.9% (95% CI: 27.8-28.1%). PCR positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs in a national community survey (May 6-7) including 1,307 participants was 14.9% (95% CI: 11.5-19.0%); 58.5% of those testing positive were asymptomatic. Across 448 ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas including 26,715 individuals, pooled mean PCR positivity was 15.6% (95% CI: 13.7-17.7%). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was 24.0% (95% CI: 23.3-24.6%) in 32,970 residual clinical blood specimens. Antibody prevalence was only 47.3% (95% CI: 46.2-48.5%) in those who had at least one PCR positive result, but it was 91.3% (95% CI: 89.5-92.9%) among those who were PCR positive >3 weeks before serology testing. There were substantial differences in exposure to infection by nationality and sex, reflecting risk differentials between the craft\/manual workers and urban populations. As of July 5, case severity rate, based on the WHO severity classification, was 3.4% and case fatality rate was 1.4 per 1,000 persons. Model-estimated daily number of infections and active-infection prevalence peaked at 22,630 and 5.7%, respectively, on May 21 and May 23. Attack rate (ever infection) was estimated at 53.5% on July 12. R0 ranged between 1.45-1.68 throughout the epidemic. Rt was estimated at 0.70 on June 15, which was hence set as onset date for easing of restrictions. Age was by far the strongest predictor of severe, critical, or fatal infection. Conclusions: Qatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that is rapidly declining, apparently due to exhaustion of susceptibles. The epidemic demonstrated a classic susceptible-infected-recovered 'SIR' dynamics with a rather stable R0 of about 1.6. The young demographic structure of the population, in addition to a resourced public health response, yielded a milder disease burden and lower mortality than elsewhere.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Houssein H Ayoub","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Zaina Al Kanaani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Abdullatif Al Khal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Einas Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Andrew Jeremijenko","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Robert C Owen","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Samya A Al Abdulla","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mohamed G Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mujeeb C Kandy","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hatoun Saeb","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Shazia Nadeem N.

We used the Open Dataset of Mexican patients with COVID-19 suspicion who had a definite RT-PCR result to develop a statistical model that evaluated the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population. We included patients of all ages with every risk factor provided by the dataset: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiencies, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, and pregnancy. The dataset also included an unspecified category for other risk factors that were not specified as a single variable. To avoid excluding potential patients at risk, that category was included in our analysis. Due to the nature of the dataset, the calculation of a standardized comorbidity index was not possible. Therefore, we treated risk factors as a categorical variable with two categories: absence of risk factors and the presence of at least one risk factor in accordance with previous epidemiological reports. Multiple logistic regressions were carried out to associate sex, risk factors, and age as a continuous variable (and the interaction that accounted for increasing diseases with older ages); and SARS-CoV-2 infection as the dependent zero-one binomial variable. Post estimation predictive marginal analysis was performed to generate probability trends along 95% confidence bands. This analysis was repeated several times through the course of the pandemic since the first record provided in their repository (April 12, 2020) to one month after the end of the state of sanitary emergency (the last date analyzed: June 27, 2020). After processing, the last measurement included 464,389 patients. The baseline analysis on April 12 revealed that people 35 years and older with at least one risk factor had a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to patients without risk factors (Figure 1). One month before the end of the nationwide state of emergency this age threshold was found at 50 years (May 2, 2020) and it shifted to 65 years on May 30. Two weeks after the end of the public emergency (June 13, 2020) the trends converged at 80 years and one week later (June 27, 2020) every male and female patient with at least one risk factor had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to people without risk factors. Through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, all four probability curves shifted upwards as a result of progressive disease spread. In conclusion, we found our model could monitor accurately the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to age, sex, and the presence of at least one risk factor. Also, because the model can be applied to any particular political region within Mexico, it could help evaluate the contagion spread in specific vulnerable populations. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying nature of the mechanisms behind such observations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Alonso Leon-Abarca","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigaciones de la Altura - Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Esdras Ismael Musayon","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Instituto de Investigaciones de la Altura"},{"author_name":"Houssein H Ayoub","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Zaina Al Kanaani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Abdullatif Al Khal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Einas Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Andrew Jeremijenko","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Robert C Owen","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Samya A Al Abdulla","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mohamed G Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mujeeb C Kandy","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hatoun Saeb","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Shazia Nadeem N.
