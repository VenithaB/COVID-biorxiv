Animal model studies of SARS-CoV and MERS suggest that the age and sex difference in COVID-19 symptom severity may be due to a protective effect of the female sex hormone estrogen. Females have shown an ability to mount a stronger immune response to a variety of viral infections because of more robust humoral and cellular immune responses. Objectives: We sought to determine whether COVID-19 positivity increases in women entering menopause. We also aimed to identify whether premenopausal women taking exogenous hormones in the form of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and post-menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have lower predicted rates of COVID-19, using our published symptom-based model. Design: The COVID Symptom Study developed by Kings College London and Zoe Global Limited was launched in the UK on 24th March 2020. It captured self-reported information related to COVID-19 symptoms. Data used for this study included records collected between 7th May - 15th June 2020. Main outcome measures: We investigated links between COVID-19 rates and 1) menopausal status, 2) COCP use and 3) HRT use, using symptom-based predicted COVID-19, tested COVID-19, and disease severity based on requirement for hospital attendance or respiratory support. Participants: Female users of the COVID Symptom Tracker Application in the UK, including 152,637 women for menopause status, 295,689 for COCP use, and 151,193 for HRT use. Analyses were adjusted for age, smoking and BMI. Results: Post-menopausal women aged 40-60 years had a higher rate of predicted COVID (P=0.003) and a corresponding range of symptoms, with consistent, but not significant trends observed for tested COVID-19 and disease severity. Women aged 18-45 years taking COCP had a significantly lower predicted COVID-19 (P=8.03E-05), with a reduction in hospital attendance (P=0.023). Post-menopausal women using HRT or hormonal therapies did not exhibit consistent associations, including increased rates of predicted COVID-19 (P=2.22E-05) for HRT users alone. Conclusions: Our findings support a protective effect of estrogen on COVID-19, based on positive association between predicted COVID-19 and menopausal status, and a negative association with COCP use. HRT use was positively associated with COVID-19 symptoms; however, the results should be considered with caution due to lack of data on HRT type, route of administration, duration of treatment, and potential comorbidities.

Methods: We accessed national English data on all adult COVID-19 specific critical care admissions from the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS), up to the 29th June 2020 (n=14,958). The study period was 1st March until 30th May, meaning every patient had 30 days of potential follow-up available. The primary outcome was in-hospital 30-day all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios for mortality were estimated for those admitted each week using a Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age (non-linear restricted cubic spline), sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and geographical region. Results: 30-day mortality peaked for people admitted to critical care in early April (peak 29.1% for HDU, 41.5% for ICU). There was subsequently a sustained decrease in mortality risk until the end of the study period. As a linear trend from the first week of April, adjusted mortality risk decreased by 11.2% (adjusted HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.87 - 0.91]) per week in HDU, and 9.0% (adjusted HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.88 - 0.94]) in ICU. Conclusions: There has been a substantial mortality improvement in people admitted to critical care with COVID-19 in England, with markedly lower mortality in people admitted in mid-April and May compared to earlier in the pandemic. This trend remains after adjustment for patient demographics and comorbidities suggesting this improvement is not due to changing patient characteristics. Possible causes include the introduction of effective treatments as part of clinical trials and a falling critical care burden.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Dennis","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Andrew McGovern","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Vollmer","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Bilal A Mateen","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"Juan Castillo-Fernandez","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Ni Lochlainn","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila Pujol","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Iain Buchan","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Louise C Kenny","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Janice Rymer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Louise Newson","author_inst":"Newson HealthMenopause & Wellbeing Centre"},{"author_name":"Jordana Bell","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20164988","rel_title":"Comparative effects of viral transport medium heat inactivation upon downstream SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20164988","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020 is testing economic resilience and surge capacity of healthcare providers worldwide. At time of writing, positive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains the only method for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. Rapid upscaling of national SARS-CoV-2 genome testing presented challenges: 1) Unpredictable supply chains of reagents and kits for virus inactivation, RNA extraction and PCR-detection of viral genomes 2) Rapid time to result of <24 hours is required in order to facilitate timely infection control measures. We evaluated whether alternative commercially available kits provided sensitivity and accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 genome detection comparable to those used by regional National Healthcare Services (NHS), and asked if detection was altered by heat inactivation, an approach for rapid one-step viral inactivation and RNA extraction without chemicals or kits. Using purified RNA, we found the CerTest VIASURE kit to be comparable to Altona RealStar system currently in use, and further showed that both diagnostic kits performed similarly in the BioRad CFX96 and Roche LightCycler 480 II machines. Additionally, both kits were comparable to a third alternative using a combination of Quantabio qScript 1-step qRT-PCR mix and CDC-accredited N1 and N2 primer\/probes when looking specifically at borderline samples. Importantly, when using the kits in an extraction-free protocol, following heat inactivation, we saw differing results, with the combined Quantabio-CDC assay showing superior accuracy and sensitivity. In particular, detection using the CDC N2 probe following the extraction-free protocol was highly correlated to results generated with the same probe following RNA extraction and reported clinically (n=127; R2=0.9259). Our results demonstrate that sample treatment can greatly affect the downstream performance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits, with varying impact depending on the kit. We also showed that one-step heat inactivation methods could reduce time from swab receipt to outcome of test result. Combined, these findings present alternatives to the protocols in use and can serve to alleviate any arising supply chain issues at different points in the workflow, whilst accelerating testing, and reducing cost and environmental impact.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jamie L Thompson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Angela Downie Ruiz Velasco","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Alice Cardall","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Tarbox","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jaineeta Richardson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Gemma Clarke","author_inst":"NUH"},{"author_name":"Michelle Lister","author_inst":"NUH"},{"author_name":"Hannah C Howson-Wells","author_inst":"NUH"},{"author_name":"Vicki M Fleming","author_inst":"NUH"},{"author_name":"Manjinder Khakh","author_inst":"Path Links Pathology"},{"author_name":"Tim Sloan","author_inst":"Path Links Pathology"},{"author_name":"Nichola Duckworth","author_inst":"Path Links Pathology"},{"author_name":"Chris Denning","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"C.

Thus, we evaluated the rate and severity of DDI between LPV-r for COVID-19 treatment and concomitant medications. This was a cross-sectional study including all individuals diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with LPV-r and attended at a single center in Southern Spain (March 1st to April 30th, 2020). The frequency [95% confidence interval (95% CI)] of potential and major DDI were calculated. Overall, 469 patients were diagnosed of COVID-19, 125 (27%) of them were prescribed LPV-r. LPV-r had potential DDI with concomitant medications in 97 (78%, 95% CI: 69%-85%) patients, and in 33 (26%, 95% CI: 19%-35%) individuals showed major DDI. Twelve (36%) patients with major DDI and 14 (15%) individuals without major DDI died (p=0.010). After adjustment, only the Charlson index was independently associated with death [adjusted OR (95% CI) for Charlson index [&ge;]5: 85 (10-731), p <0.001]. LPV-r was discontinued due to side effects in 31 (25%) patients. Management by the Infectious Diseases Unit was associated with a lower likelihood of major DDI [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI): 0.14 (0.04-0.53), p=0.003). In conclusion, a high frequency of DDI between LPV-r for treating COVID-19 and concomitant medications was found, including major DDI. Patients with major DDI showed worse outcomes, but this association was explained by the older age and comorbidities. Patients managed by the Infectious Diseases Unit had lower risk of major DDI.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Macias","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Valme"},{"author_name":"Ana Pinilla","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Unit, Hospital Universitario Virgen de Valme.

Studies investigating underlying immune characteristics are needed to understand disease pathogenesis and inform vaccine design. In this study, we examined immune cell subsets in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals. In hospitalized patients, many adaptive and innate immune cells were decreased in frequency compared to healthy and convalescent individuals, with the exception of B lymphocytes which increased. Our findings show increased frequencies of T-cell activation markers (CD69, Ox40, HLA-DR and CD154) in hospitalized patients, with other T-cell activation\/exhaustion markers (CD25, PD-L1 and TIGIT) remaining elevated in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals. B cells had a similar pattern of activation\/exhaustion, with increased frequency of CD69 and CD95 during hospitalization, followed by an increase in PD1 frequencies in non-hospitalized individuals. Interestingly, many of these changes were found to increase over time in non-hospitalized longitudinal samples, suggesting a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in T-cell activation\/exhaustion in non-hospitalized patients were found to positively correlate with age. Severely infected individuals had increased expression of activation and exhaustion markers. These data suggest a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighting the need for additional studies investigating immune dysregulation in convalescent individuals.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacob K Files","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sushma Boppana","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Mildred D Perez","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sanghita Sarkar","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Kelsey E Lowman","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Kai Qin","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sarah Sterrett","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Eric Carlin","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Anju Bansal","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Steffanie Sabbaj","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Dustin M Long","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Olaf Kutsch","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"James Kobie","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Paul A Goepfert","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nathan Erdmann","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Claire H Seedhouse","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20164327","rel_title":"Self-rated smell ability enables highly specific predictors of COVID-19 status: a case control study in Israel","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20164327","rel_abs":"Background: Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 poses an enormous challenge to early detection and prevention of COVID-19, which is of crucial importance for pandemic containment. Cases of COVID-19 may be hard to distinguish clinically from other acute viral diseases, resulting in an overwhelming load of laboratory screening. Sudden onset of taste and smell loss emerge as hallmark of COVID-19. The optimal ways for including these symptoms in the screening of suspected COVID-19 patients should now be established. Methods: We performed a case-control study on patients that were PCR-tested for COVID-19 (112 positive and 112 negative participants), recruited during the first wave (March 2020 - May 2020) of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. Patients were interviewed by phone regarding their symptoms and medical history and were asked to rate their olfactory and gustatory ability before and during their illness on a 1-10 scale. Prevalence and degrees of symptoms were calculated, and odds ratios were estimated. Symptoms-based logistic-regression classifiers were constructed and evaluated on a hold-out set. Results: Changes in smell and taste occurred in 68% (95% CI 60%-76%) and 72% (64%-80%), of positive patients, with 24 (11-53 range) and 12 (6-23) respective odds ratios. The ability to smell was decreased by 0.5 {+\/-} 1.5 in negatives, and by 4.5 {+\/-} 3.6 in positives, and to taste by 0.4 {+\/-} 1.5 and 4.9 {+\/-} 3.8, respectively (mean {+\/-} SD). A penalized logistic regression classifier based on 5 symptoms (degree of smell change, muscle ache, lack of appetite, fever, and a negatively contributing sore throat), has 66% sensitivity, 97% specificity and an area under the ROC curve of 0.83 (AUC) on a hold-out set. A classifier based on degree of smell change only is almost as good, with 66% sensitivity, 97% specificity and 0.81 AUC. Under the assumption of 8% positives among those tested, the predictive positive value (PPV) of this classifier is 0.68 and negative predictive value (NPV) is 0.97. Conclusions: Self-reported quantitative olfactory changes, either alone or combined with other symptoms, provide a specific and powerful tool for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. The applicability of this tool for prioritizing COVID-19 laboratory testing is facilitated by a simple calculator presented here.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noam Karni","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Mt.

Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies and publicly available data to quantify the association between predisposing health conditions, demographics, and behavioural factors with hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death from COVID-19. We provided ranges of reported and calculated effect estimates and pooled relative risks derived from a meta-analysis and meta-regression. Results 75 studies were included into qualitative and 74 into quantitative synthesis, with study populations ranging from 19 - 44,672 COVID-19 cases. The risk of dying from COVID-19 was significantly associated with cerebrovascular [pooled RR 2.7 (95% CI 1.7-4.1)] and cardiovascular [RR 3.2 (CI 2.3-4.5)] diseases, hypertension [RR 2.6 (CI 2.0-3.4)], and renal disease [RR 2.5 (CI 1.8-3.4)]. Health care workers had lower risk for death and severe outcomes of disease (RR 0.1 (CI 0.1-0.3). Our meta-regression showed a decrease of the effect of some comorbidities on severity of disease with higher median age of study populations. Associations between comorbidities and hospitalisation and ICU admission were less strong than for death.

Materials and Methods: We accessed the New York Times GitHub repository COVID19 data and 2018 US Census data for all US Counties. The disparate datasets were merged and filtered to allow for visualization and assessments about case fatality rate (CFR%) and associated demographic, ethnic and economic features. Results: Our results suggest that county-level COVID19 fatality rates are related to advanced population age (p <0.001) and less diversity as evidenced by higher proportion of Caucasians in High CFR% counties (p < 0.001). Also, lower CFR% counties had a greater proportion of the population reporting has having 2 or more races (p <0.001). We noted no significant differences between High and Low CFR% counties with respect to mean income or poverty rate. Conclusions: Unique COVID19 impacts are realized at the county level. Use of public datasets, data science skills and information visualization can yield helpful insights to drive understanding about community-level vulnerability.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gina Cahill","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Houston TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Carleigh Kutac","author_inst":"Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center, Houston TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas L Rider","author_inst":"BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE"},{"author_name":"Annabelle Bockey","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, University Hospital Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Hannover Medical School, German Centre for Infection Research, Twincore"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, German Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Ran Nir-Paz","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Hadassah-Hebrew University medical center"},{"author_name":"Alon Hershko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Mt.

Generalized protective measures such as wearing face masks, improved hygiene, and local reductions in density are found to significantly increase the effectiveness of targeted interventions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Drake","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Pejman Rohani","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Kyle Dahlin","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Andreas Handel","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Hannover Medical School, German Centre for Infection Research, Twincore"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, German Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Ran Nir-Paz","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Hadassah-Hebrew University medical center"},{"author_name":"Alon Hershko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Mt.

Taking into account this age-dependent fatality rate, a mathematical model considering young and elder subpopulations was formulated based on the natural history of covid-19 to study the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. This model can be applied to study the epidemiological scenario resulting from the adoption of isolation or lockdown in many countries to control the rapid propagation of covid-19. We chose as examples the isolation adopted in Sao Paulo State (Brazil) in the early phase but not at the beginning of the epidemic, and the lockdown implemented in Spain when the number of severe covid-19 cases was increasing rapidly. Based on the data collected from Sa o Paulo State and Spain, the model parameters were evaluated and we obtained higher estimation for the basic reproduction number R0 (9.24 for Sao Paulo State, and 8 for Spain) compared to the currently accepted estimation of R0 around 3. The model allowed to explain the flattening of the epidemic curves by isolation in Sao Paulo State and lockdown in Spain when associated with the protective measures (face mask and social distancing) adopted by the population. However, a simplified mathematical model providing lower estimation for R0 did not explain the flattening of the epidemic curves. The implementation of the isolation in Sa o Paulo State before the rapidly increasing phase of the epidemic enlarged the period of the first wave of the epidemic and delayed its peak, which are the desirable results of isolation to avoid the overloading in the health care system.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyun Mo Yang","author_inst":"State University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Luis Pedro Lombardi Jr.","author_inst":"State University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Fabio Fernandes Morato Castro","author_inst":"General Hospital of the Medicine School of University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ariana Campos Yang","author_inst":"General Hospital of the Medicine School of University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Hannover Medical School, German Centre for Infection Research, Twincore"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, German Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Ran Nir-Paz","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Hadassah-Hebrew University medical center"},{"author_name":"Alon Hershko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Mt.

We took COVID swabs from the peritoneal cavity and from the vagina from all eligible patients. Results were stratified by pre operative COVID status. Results In patients who were presumed COVID negative at the time of surgery SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was detected in 0\/102 peritoneal samples and 0\/98 vaginal samples. Peritoneal and vaginal swabs were also negative in one patient who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab immediately prior to surgery. Conclusions The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the abdominal fluid or lower genital tract of presumed negative patients is nil or extremely low.

Design: Rapid scoping review of literature available until 8th April 2020. Setting: International studies on the infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 Participants: Studies were selected for inclusion if they defined asymptomatics as a separate cohort distinct from pre-symptomatics and if they provided a quantitative measure of the infectiousness of asymptomatics relative to symptomatics. Primary outcome measures: The relative number of secondary cases produced by an average primary case, the relative probability of transmitting infection upon contact, and the degree of viral shedding. Results: Very few studies reported estimates of relative infectiousness of asymptomatic compared with symptomatic individuals. Significant differences exist in the definition of infectiousness. Viral shedding studies in general show no difference in shedding levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals but are likely to be impacted by insufficient statistical power. Two contact tracing studies provided estimates of 0.7 and 1.0, but differences in approach and definition preclude comparison across the two studies. Finally, two modelling studies suggest a relative infectiousness of around 0.5 but one of these was more reflective of the infectiousness of undocumented rather than asymptomatic cases. Importantly, one contact tracing study showing a very low level of infectiousness of asymptomatic was not included in the analysis at this point due difficulties interpreting the reported findings. Conclusions: The present study highlights the need for additional studies in this area as a matter of urgency. For the purpose of epidemiological modelling, we cautiously suggest that at present, asymptomatics could be considered to have a degree of infectiousness which is about 0.40-0.70 that of symptomatics. However, it must be stressed that this suggestion comes from a very low evidence base and that estimates exist that are close to zero and close to 1.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Mc Evoy","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Aine B Collins","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"DAFM"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"John M Griffin","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"James Kobie","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Paul A Goepfert","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nathan Erdmann","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Claire H Seedhouse","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20165118","rel_title":"Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on heart rate variability","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20165118","rel_abs":"Introduction: Strict lockdown rules were imposed to the French population from 17 March to 11 May 2020, which may result in limited possibilities of physical activity, modified psychological and health states. This report is focused on HRV parameters kinetics before, during and after this lockdown period. Methods: 95 participants were included in this study, who underwent regular orthostatic tests (a 5-minute supine followed by a 5-minute standing recording of heart rate (HR)) on a regular basis before, during and after the lockdown (BSL, CFN and RCV, respectively). HR, power in low- and high-frequency bands (LF, HF, respectively) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) were computed for each orthostatic test, and for each positions. Subjective well-being was assessed on a 0-10 visual analogic scale (VAS). Results: Out of the 95 participants, 19 (WB+) reported an improved well-being (i.e., increase >2 in VAS score) during CFN, contradictory to the 76 other participants (WB-). There was an increase in HR and a decrease in RMSSD when measured supine in CFN and RCV, compared to BSL in WB-, whilst opposite results were found in WB+ (i.e. decrease in HR and increase in RMSSD in CFN and RCV; increase in LF and HF in RCV). There was a moderate significant correlation between VAS and HR, RMSSD, HF, respectively, in the supine position; the higher the VAS score (i.e., subjective well-being), the higher the RMSSD and HF and the lower the HR. In standing position, HRV parameters were not modified during CFN. Conclusion: The strict COVID-19 lockdown likely had opposite effects on French population as 20% of participants improved parasympathetic activation (RMSSD, HF) and rated positively this period, whilst 80% showed altered responses and deteriorated well-being. The changes in HRV parameters during and after the lockdown period were in line with subjective well-being responses. These results confirmed the usefulness of HRV as a non-invasive means for monitoring well-being and health in the general population.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Bourdillon","author_inst":"becare SA \/ UNIL"},{"author_name":"Sasan Yazdani","author_inst":"becare SA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Schmitt","author_inst":"becare SA"},{"author_name":"Gregoire P Millet","author_inst":"UNIL - ISSUL"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"DAFM"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"John M Griffin","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"James Kobie","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Paul A Goepfert","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nathan Erdmann","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Claire H Seedhouse","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20163790","rel_title":"Critical Mobility, a practical criterion and early indicator for regional COVID-19 resurgence","rel_date":"2020-07-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20163790","rel_abs":"The sharp reduction of human mobility in March 2020, as observed by anonymized cellphone data, has played an important role in thwarting a runaway COVID-19 pandemic.

The normalized difference between the current and critical mobility has predictive power for case trajectories during the \"opening-up\" phases. For instance, actual mobility has risen above critical mobility in many southern US counties by the end of May, foreshadowing the latest virus resurgence. Encouragingly, critical mobility has been rising throughout the USA, likely due to face mask-wearing and social distancing measures. However, critical mobility is still well below pre-COVID mobility levels in most of the country suggesting continued mobility-reduction is still necessary.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcus O Freitag","author_inst":"IBM T.

Here we show that academic biochemistry and molecular biology laboratories equipped with appropriate expertise and infrastructure can replicate commercially available SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test kits and backfill pipeline shortages. The Georgia Tech COVID-19 Test Kit Support Group, composed of faculty, staff, and trainees across the biotechnology quad at Georgia Institute of Technology, synthesized multiplexed primers and probes and formulated a master mix composed of enzymes and proteins produced in-house. Our in-house kit compares favorably to a commercial product used for diagnostic testing. We also developed an environmental testing protocol to readily monitor surfaces across various campus laboratories for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Our blueprint should be readily reproducible by research teams at other institutions, and our protocols may be modified and adapted to enable SARS-CoV-2 detection in more resource-limited settings.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha J.

However, the specific characteristics of these at-risk populations are still not known and approaches to lower mortality are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective electronic health record data analysis of 25,326 subjects tested for COVID-19 between 2\/25\/20 and 6\/22\/20 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, a tertiary health care center in the racially diverse Southern U.S. The primary outcome was mortality in COVID-19-positive subjects and the association with subject characteristics and comorbidities was analyzed using simple and multiple linear logistic regression. RESULTS: The odds ratio of contracting COVID-19 was disproportionately high in Blacks\/African-Americans (OR 2.6; 95%CI 2.19-3.10; p<0.0001) and in subjects with obesity (OR 1.93; 95%CI 1.64-2.28; p<0.0001), hypertension (OR 2.46; 95%CI 2.07-2.93; p<0.0001), and diabetes (OR 2.11; 95%CI 1.78-2.48; p<0.0001). Diabetes was also associated with a dramatic increase in mortality (OR 3.62; 95%CI 2.11-6.2; p<0.0001) and emerged as an independent risk factor in this diverse population even after correcting for age, race, sex, obesity and hypertension. Interestingly, we found that metformin treatment was independently associated with a significant reduction in mortality in subjects with diabetes and COVID-19 (OR 0.33; 95%CI 0.13-0.84; p=0.0210). CONCLUSION: Thus, these results suggest that while diabetes is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality, this risk is dramatically reduced in subjects taking metformin, raising the possibility that metformin may provide a protective approach in this high risk population.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Crouse","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Grimes","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Peng Li","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Matthew Might","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Fernando Ovalle","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Anath Shalev","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Chieri Ito","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Liangjun Zhao","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Gary P.

The N protein is composed of N-terminal RNA-binding and C-terminal dimerization domains that are flanked by three intrinsically disordered regions. Here we demonstrate that a centrally located 40 amino acid intrinsically disordered domain drives phase separation of N protein when bound to RNA, with the morphology of the resulting condensates affected by inclusion in the RNA of the putative SARS-CoV-2 packaging signal. The SARS-CoV-2 M protein, normally embedded in the virion membrane with its C-terminus extending into the virion core, independently induces N protein phase separation that is dependent on the N proteins C-terminal dimerization domain and disordered region. Three-component mixtures of N+M+RNA form condensates with mutually exclusive compartments containing N+M or N+RNA, including spherical annular structures in which the M protein coats the outside of an N+RNA condensate. These findings support a model in which phase separation of the N protein with both the viral genomic RNA and the SARS-CoV-2 M protein facilitates RNA packaging and virion assembly.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shan Lu","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Qiaozhen Ye","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Digvijay Singh","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Villa","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Don W.

Here, we investigated the molecular, phylogenomic, and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in western India, the most affected region of the country. A total of 90 genomes were sequenced. Four nucleotide variants, namely C241T, C3037T, C14408T (Pro4715Leu), and A23403G (Asp614Gly), located at 5UTR, Orf1a, Orf1b, and Spike protein regions of the genome, respectively, were predominant and ubiquitous (90%). Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes revealed four distinct clusters, formed owing to different variants. The major cluster (cluster 4) is distinguished by mutations C313T, C5700A, G28881A are unique patterns and observed in 45% of samples. We thus report a newly emerging pattern of linked mutations. The predominance of these linked mutations suggests that they are likely a part of the viral fitness landscape. A novel and distinct pattern of mutations in the viral strains of each of the districts was observed. The Satara district viral strains showed mutations primarily at the 3' end of the genome, while Nashik district viral strains displayed mutations at the 5' end of the genome. Characterization of Pune strains showed that a novel variant has overtaken the other strains. Examination of the frequency of three mutations i.e., C313T, C5700A, G28881A in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients indicated an increased occurrence in symptomatic cases, which is more prominent in females. The age-wise specific pattern of mutation is observed. Mutations C18877T, G20326A, G24794T, G25563T, G26152T, and C26735T are found in more than 30% study samples in the age group of 10-25. Intriguingly, these mutations are not detected in the higher age range 61-80. These findings portray the prevalence of unique linked mutations in SARS-CoV-2 in western India and their prevalence in symptomatic patients.\n\nImportanceElucidation of the SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape within a specific geographical location, and its relationship with age and symptoms, is essential to understand its local transmission dynamics and control. Here we present the first comprehensive study on genome and mutation pattern analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from the western part of India, the worst affected region by the pandemic. Our analysis revealed three unique linked mutations, which are prevalent in most of the sequences studied. These may serve as a molecular marker to track the spread of this viral variant to different places.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhiraj Paul","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Kunal Jani","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Janesh Kumar","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Radha Chauhan","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Vasudevan Seshadri","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Girdhari Lal","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Karyakarte","author_inst":"B.

The tight links that necessarily exist between the virus as it multiplies and the metabolism of its host are systematically ignored. Here we show that the metabolism of all cells is coordinated by the availability of a core building block of the cells genome, cytidine triphosphate (CTP). This metabolite is also the key to the synthesis of the viral envelope and to the translation of its genome into proteins. This unique role explains why evolution has led to the early emergence in animals of an antiviral immunity enzyme, viperin, that synthesizes a toxic analogue of CTP. The constraints arising from this dependency guide the evolution of the virus. With this in mind, we explored the real-time experiment taking place before our eyes using probabilistic modelling approaches to the molecular evolution of the virus. We have thus followed, almost on a daily basis, the evolution of the composition of the viral genome to link it to the progeny produced over time, particularly in the form of blooms that sparked a firework of viral mutations. Some of those certainly increase the propagation of the virus. This led us to make out the critical role in this evolution of several proteins of the virus, such as its nucleocapsid N, and more generally to begin to understand how the virus ties up the host metabolism to its own benefit. A way for the virus to escape CTP-dependent control in cells would be to infect cells that are not expected to grow, such as neurons. This may account for unexpected body sites of viral development in the present epidemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Cluzel","author_inst":"Tremplin Carnot SMILES, 4 Place Jussieu, 75005 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Amaury Lambert","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Probabilites, Statistique & Modelisation (LPSM), Sorbonne Universite, Universite de Paris, CNRS UMR8001, 4 place Jussieu, 75005 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Yvon Maday","author_inst":"Tremplin Carnot SMILES, 4 Place Jussieu, 75005 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Turinici","author_inst":"Ceremade, Universite Paris Dauphine - PSL"},{"author_name":"Antoine Danchin","author_inst":"Kodikos Labs \/ Stellate Therapeutics, Institut Cochin, 24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Randy A.

We considered a material with high hydrogen bonding capacity (cellulose) and a material capable of strong hydrophobic interactions (graphite). Initially, the spike adsorbs to both surfaces through essentially the same residues belonging to the receptor binding subunit of its three monomers. Adsorption onto cellulose stabilizes in this configuration, with the help of a large number of hydrogen bonds developed between cellulose and the three receptor binding domains (RBD) of the glycoprotein spike. In the case of adsorption onto graphite, the initial adsorption configuration is not stable and the surface induces a substantial deformation of the glycoprotein spike with a large number of adsorbed residues not pertaining to the binding subunits of the spike monomers.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David C Malaspina","author_inst":"Institut de Ciencia de Materials de Barcelona, ICMAB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Jordi Faraudo","author_inst":"Institut de Ciencia de Materials de Barcelona, ICMAB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Yvon Maday","author_inst":"Tremplin Carnot SMILES, 4 Place Jussieu, 75005 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Turinici","author_inst":"Ceremade, Universite Paris Dauphine - PSL"},{"author_name":"Antoine Danchin","author_inst":"Kodikos Labs \/ Stellate Therapeutics, Institut Cochin, 24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Randy A.

Blocking this interaction provides a potent approach to preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, the ability of {beta}-chitosan to block the binding interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 was investigated. The inhibitory effect of {beta}-chitosan on inflammation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was also studied. Native-PAGE analysis indicated that {beta}-chitosan could bind with ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and a conjugate of {beta}-chitosan and ACE2 could no longer bind with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. HPLC analysis suggested that a conjugate of {beta}-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD displayed high binding affinity without dissociation under high pressure (40 MPa) compared with that of {beta}-chitosan and ACE2. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining of Vero E6 cells and lungs from hACE2 mice showed that the presence of {beta}-chitosan prevented SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD from binding to ACE2. Meanwhile, {beta}-chitosan could dramatically suppress the inflammation caused by the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD both in vitro and vivo. Moreover, the decreased expression of ACE2 caused by {beta}-chitosan treatment was restored by addition of TAPI-1, an inhibitor of the transmembrane protease ADAM17. Our findings demonstrated that {beta}-chitosan displays an antibody-like function capable of neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and effectively preventing the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2. Moreover, ADAM17 activation induced by {beta}-chitosan treatment can enhance the cleavage of the extracellular domain of ACE2, releasing the active ectodomain into the extracellular environment, which can prevent the binding, internalization, and degradation of ACE2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and thus diminish inflammation. Our study provides an alternative avenue for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection using {beta}-chitosan.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gulimiran Alitongbieke","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xiu-Min Li","author_inst":"Fujian Universities Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungus Industry, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Qi-Ci Wu","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Chao Lin","author_inst":"Fujian Universities Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungus Industry, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jia-Fu Huang","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Xue","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-Na Liu","author_inst":"School of Biological Science and Biotechnology, Minnan Normal University, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-Mei Lin","author_inst":"College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Environment, Minnan Normal University, 363000, Zhangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Tao Pan","author_inst":"Mengdeer (Xiamen) Biotechnology Co., Ltd., 361000, Xiamen, China;  Fujian Maillardkan Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd., 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yi-Xuan Chen","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yi Su","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guo-Guang Zhang","author_inst":"School of Biological Science and Biotechnology, Minnan Normal University, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Leng","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shu-Wen Liu","author_inst":"School of Biological Science and Biotechnology, Minnan Normal University, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yu-Tian Pan","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China; School of Biological Science and Biotechnology, Minnan Norm"},{"author_name":"Peter Palese","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yogesh S Shouche","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Pamela Pollet","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Brooke Rothschild-Mancinelli","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Santi Mestre-Fos","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Guth-Metzler","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Anton V.

Here, using optical tweezers, we find that nsp13 unwinding frequency, processivity, and velocity increase substantially when a destabilizing force is applied to the dsRNA, suggesting a passive unwinding mechanism. These results, along with bulk assays, depict nsp13 as an intrinsically weak helicase that can be potently activated by picoNewton forces. Such force-dependent behavior contrasts the known behavior of other viral monomeric helicases, drawing stronger parallels to ring-shaped helicases. Our findings suggest that mechanoregulation, which may be provided by a directly bound RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, enables on-demand helicase activity on the relevant polynucleotide substrate during viral replication.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Keith J Mickolajczyk","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Patrick M M Shelton","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michael Grasso","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Xiaocong Cao","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Sara R Warrington","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Amol Aher","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Shixin Liu","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Tarun M Kapoor","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Xiaochun Wan","author_inst":"Anhui Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Zhang","author_inst":"Anhui Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yi Su","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guo-Guang Zhang","author_inst":"School of Biological Science and Biotechnology, Minnan Normal University, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Leng","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shu-Wen Liu","author_inst":"School of Biological Science and Biotechnology, Minnan Normal University, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yu-Tian Pan","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China; School of Biological Science and Biotechnology, Minnan Norm"},{"author_name":"Peter Palese","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yogesh S Shouche","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Pamela Pollet","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Brooke Rothschild-Mancinelli","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Santi Mestre-Fos","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Guth-Metzler","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Anton V.

Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers elicited by a dose-sparing regimen in mice were similar to those obtained from a high dose regimen.

Since the first whole-genome sequence was published in January 2020, a growing database of tens of thousands of viral genomes has been constructed. This offers opportunities to study pathways of molecular change in the expanding viral population that can help identify molecular culprits of virulence and virus spread. Here we investigate the genomic accumulation of mutations at various time points of the early pandemic to identify changes in mutationally highly active genomic regions that are occurring worldwide. We used the Wuhan NC_045512.2 sequence as a reference and sampled 15,342 indexed sequences from GISAID, translating them into proteins and grouping them by month of deposition. The per-position amino acid frequencies and Shannon entropies of the coding sequences were calculated for each month, and a map of intrinsic disorder regions and binding sites was generated. The analysis revealed dominant variants, most of which were located in loop regions and on the surface of the proteins. Mutation entropy decreased between March and April of 2020 after steady increases at several sites, including the D614G mutation site of the spike (S) protein that was previously found associated with higher case fatality rates and at sites of the NSP 12 polymerase and the NSP13 helicase proteins. Notable expanding mutations include R203K and G204R of the nucleocapsid (N) protein inter-domain linker region and G251V of the viroporin encoded by ORF3a between March and April. The regions spanning these mutations exhibited significant intrinsic disorder, which was enhanced and decreased by the N-protein and viroporin 3a protein mutations, respectively. These results predict an ongoing mutational shift from the spike and replication complex to other regions, especially to encoded molecules known to represent major {beta}-interferon antagonists. The study provides valuable information for therapeutics and vaccine design, as well as insight into mutation tendencies that could facilitate preventive control.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tre Tomaszewski","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Ryan S DeVries","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Mengyi Dong","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Gitanshu Bhatia","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Miles D Norsworthy","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Xuying Zheng","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Caetano-Anolles","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Karin Lor\u00e9","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Xaquin Castro Dopico","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M Coquet","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Shu-Wen Liu","author_inst":"School of Biological Science and Biotechnology, Minnan Normal University, 363000, Zhangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yu-Tian Pan","author_inst":"Fujian Engineering Technology Research Center of Fungal Active Substances, 363000, Zhangzhou, China; School of Biological Science and Biotechnology, Minnan Norm"},{"author_name":"Peter Palese","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yogesh S Shouche","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Pamela Pollet","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Brooke Rothschild-Mancinelli","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Santi Mestre-Fos","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Guth-Metzler","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Anton V.

SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) is known to use receptor-binding domain (RBD) at viral surface spike (S) protein to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on many human cell types. The RBD-ACE2 interaction is a crucial step to mediate the host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has higher affinity than its binding with the structurally identical S protein of SARS-CoV-1, the virus causing the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. However, the biophysical mechanism behind such binding affinity difference is unclear. This study utilizes a combined single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation approach to quantify the specific interactions between CoV-2 or CoV-1 RBD and ACE2. Depending on the loading rates, the unbinding forces between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 range from 70 to 110 pN, and are 30-50% higher than those of CoV-1 RBD and ACE2 under similar loading rates. SMD results indicate that CoV-2 RBD interacts with the N-linked glycan on Asn90 of ACE2. This interaction is mostly absent in the CoV-1 RBD-ACE2 complex. During the SMD simulations, the extra RBD-N-glycan interaction contributes to a greater force and prolonged interaction lifetime. The observation is confirmed by our experimental force spectroscopy study. After the removal of N-linked glycans on ACE2, its mechanical binding strength with CoV-2 RBD decreases to a similar level of the CoV-1 RBD-ACE2 interaction. Together, the study uncovers the mechanism behind the difference in ACE2 binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, and could aid in the development of new strategies to block SARS-CoV-2 entry.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThis study utilizes a combined single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics simulation approach to quantify the specific interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 receptor-binding domain and human ACE2.
