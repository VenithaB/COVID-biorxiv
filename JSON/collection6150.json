The research team has processed anonymized mobile device location data to identify trips and produced a set of variables including social distancing index, percentage of people staying at home, visits to work and non-work locations, out-of-town trips, and trip distance. The results are aggregated to county and state levels to protect privacy and scaled to the entire population of each county and state. The research team are making their data and findings, which are updated daily and go back to January 1, 2020, for benchmarking, available to the public in order to help public officials make informed decisions. This paper presents a summary of the platform and describes the methodology used to process data and produce the platform metrics.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Sepehr Ghader","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Michael L Pack","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Chenfeng Xiong","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Aref Darzi","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Mofeng Yang","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Qianqian Sun","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"AliAkbar Kabiri","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Songhua Hu","author_inst":"University of Maryland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20086421","rel_title":"Characteristics of lymphocyte subsets and their predicting values for the severity of COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20086421","rel_abs":"Severe COVID-19 patients showed worse clinical outcomes compared to mild and moderate patients. However, effective indicators are still lacking to predict the severity of the disease. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of 16 COVID-19 patients and found that the absolute counts of three T-cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) were significantly lower in the moderate and severe patients than those in mild patients and were significantly lower in severe patients than in moderate patients on admission. With the recovery of the COVID-19, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, PCT, and IL6) of moderate and severe patients gradually decreased. In contrast, the counts of lymphocytes and their subsets including CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells gradually increased in severe patients, and eventually showed comparable levels with moderate patients. ROC analysis showed that the counts of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells with AUC > 0.9 have potential values for predicting the severity of COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the reduction of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells is related to the severity of COVID-19 and dynamic detection of these T-lymphocyte subsets may help predict the outcome of the patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingrong Wang","author_inst":"First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province"},{"author_name":"Xingqi Dong","author_inst":"Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Boting Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Xinping Yang","author_inst":"Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Zhi Li","author_inst":"First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province"},{"author_name":"Xicheng Wang","author_inst":"Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shuguang Zuo","author_inst":"Kaifeng Kangbien Medical Laboratory"},{"author_name":"AliAkbar Kabiri","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Songhua Hu","author_inst":"University of Maryland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086082","rel_title":"Probable causes and risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 test in recovered patients: Evidence from Brunei Darussalam","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086082","rel_abs":"We report findings of a national study in Brunei Darussalam indicating that one in five recovered patients subsequently test positive again for SARS-CoV-2 - this risk is nearly three times higher in older patients (age 53 and above) than younger ones (below age 53).

Design:Retrospective case series. Setting:Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Participants:From 4 February to 14 April 2020, 106 patients with neurological diseases were enrolled from all patients in the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 and divided into a severe group and a nonsevere group according to their COVID-19 diagnosis. Main outcome measures:Clinical characteristics, laboratory results, imaging findings, and treatment methods were all retrieved through an electronic medical records system and recorded in spreadsheets. Results:The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of patients was 72.7 (11.8) years, and 64 patients were male (60.4%). Among patients with co-morbid neurological diseases, 81 had a previous cerebral infarction (76.4%), 20 had dementia (18.9%), 10 had acute cerebral infarction (9.4%), 5 had sequelae of cerebral haemorrhage (4.7%), 4 had intracranial mass lesions (3.8%), 3 had epilepsy (2.8%), 2 had Parkinsons disease (1.9%), and 1 had myelopathy (0.9%). Fever (n = 62, 58.5%) was the most common symptom. The most common neurological symptoms were myalgia (n = 26, 24.5%), followed by extremity paralysis (n = 20, 18.9%), impaired consciousness (n = 17, 16%), and positive focal neurological signs (n = 42, 39.6%). Eight patients (7.5%) died. There were more patients with altered mental status in the severe group than in the non-severe group (6 [10.2%] vs. 0, P = 0.033). The inflammatory response in the severe group was more significant than that in the non-severe group. There were more patients taking anticoagulant drugs (25 [42.4%] vs. 4 [8.5%], P < 0.001) and sedative drugs (22 [37.3%] vs. 9 [19.1%], P = 0.041) in the severe group than in the non-severe group. Amid all 93 patients with cerebrovascular diseases, only 32 (34.4%) were taking aspirin, 13 (14%) taking clopidogrel, and 33 (35.5%) taking statins. Conclusions:Patients with COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases had an advanced age, a high rate of severe illness, and a high mortality rate. Among the neurological symptoms, altered mental status was more common in patients with severe COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rong Yin","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China; Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiqi Yang","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yaxuan Wei","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanming Li","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"Information Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China; Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhao Liu","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhao","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Dandan Ma","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Meiling Dan","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Zhang","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Huiceng Leng","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Dawei Xiang","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China; Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20085613","rel_title":"Humoral immune response and prolonged PCR positivity in a cohort of 1343 SARS-CoV 2 patients in the New York City region","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20085613","rel_abs":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic.

In addition, it has been shown in some individuals that viral genome can still be detected at considerable time post symptom resolution. Here we investigated both seroconversion and PCR-positivity in a large cohort of convalescent serum donors in New York City. Methods: Individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened via PCR for presence of viral genome and via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for presence of anti SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies. Results: All but three confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients seroconverted to the SARS-CoV-2 spike while only 37.4% of suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients seroconverted. PCR-positivity was detected up to 28 days from symptom resolution. Conclusions: Here we show that the vast majority of confirmed COVID19 patients seroconvert, potentially providing immunity to reinfection. We also report that in a large proportion of individuals, viral genome can be detected via PCR in the upper respiratory tract for weeks post symptom resolution, but it is unclear if this signal represents infectious virus.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ania Wajnberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Mayce Mansour","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emily Leven","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Nicole M Bouvier","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Arinsburg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jane Houldsworth","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ian Baine","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20085456","rel_title":"Homegrown Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation for Hospital-Based N95 Decontamination during the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20085456","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is responsible for the 2020 global pandemic and characterized by high transmissibility and morbidity.

Effective FFR decontamination modalities exist, which could maintain respiratory protection for HCWs in the midst of the current pandemic, through the decontamination and re-use of FFRs. Here, we present a locally-implemented ultraviolet-C germicidal irradiation (UVGI)-based FFR decontamination pathway, utilizing a home-built UVGI array assembled entirely with previously existing components available at our institution.

With substantial age and sex differences in CoViD-19 mortality, that number should be adjusted for the age-and-sex composition of the population as well as its total size. Following well-established practices in demography, this article discusses several period measures based on cumulative numbers of CoViD-19 deaths up to a point in time and illustrate them with weekly-updated data from 386 national and subnational populations. First is an unstandardized occurrence-exposure rate comparable to the Crude Death Rate. The peak estimate for New York exceeded the state most recent annual Crude Death Rate and remains the highest on record. Second, an indirectly standardized rate is shown to perform quite like a directly standardized rate but without requiring an age-and-sex breakdown of CoViD-19 deaths. Relative to the US, standardization lowers death rates in European populations and increases them in most other populations, with the highest standardized rates currently found in subnational Mexican and Peruvian populations. Last, projected end-of-the-year CoViD-19 death tallies can be translated into reductions in 2020 life expectancies, which could exceed two and a half years in Peru and Ecuador, and in various subnational entities from Baja California to Madrid and New York. To put these in perspective, the 1.5-year projected reduction for the US would bring 2020 life expectancy at birth to its lowest level since 2003 and induce its largest annual decline since World War II.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Heuveline","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Michael Tzen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Jane E.

With these findings we designed a clinical and biological framework that explains clinical observations. The ACE2 utilization by the virus leads to local pulmonary inflammation due to ACE2-ATII disbalance. This is enhanced by an increase in leptin production induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of visceral fat. Leptin receptors in the lungs are now more activated to enhance local pulmonary inflammation. This adds to the pre-existent chronic inflammation in obese patients. Visceral fat, lung tissue and leptin production play an interconnecting role.

The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV), now declared a pandemic has an overall case fatality of 2 to 3% but it is as high as 50% in critically ill patients. D-dimer is an important prognostic tool, often elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and in those who suffered death. In this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the prognostic role of D-dimer in COVID-19 infected patients. Methods. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane for studies reporting admission D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients and its effect on mortality. Results. 18 studies (16 retrospective and 2 prospective) with a total of 3,682 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled mean difference (MD) suggested significantly elevated D-dimer levels in patients who died versus those survived (MD 6.13 mg\/L, 95% CI 4.16 to 8.11, p <0.001). Similarly, the pooled mean D-dimer levels were significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (MD 0.54 mg\/L, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.8, p< 0.001). In addition, the risk of mortality was four-fold higher in patients with positive D-dimer vs negative D-dimer (RR 4.11, 95% CI 2.48 to 6.84, p< 0.001) and the risk of developing the severe disease was two-fold higher in patients with positive D-dimer levels vs negative D-dimer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.11, p < 0.001). Conclusion. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 presenting with elevated D-dimer levels have an increased risk of severe disease and mortality.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siddharth Shah","author_inst":"State University of New York, Upstate Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kuldeep Shah","author_inst":"West Virginia University"},{"author_name":"Siddharth B Patel","author_inst":"University of Alabama"},{"author_name":"Forman S Patel","author_inst":"University of Alabama"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Osman","author_inst":"West Virginia University"},{"author_name":"Poonam Velagapudi","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mohit K Turagam","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy","author_inst":"Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute and Research Foundation"},{"author_name":"Jalaj Garg","author_inst":"Medical College of Wisconsin"},{"author_name":"Stephen M.

We conducted a primary survey of 521 adults on April 1-10, 2020 in Iran, where the official infection rate was 0.08%. In our sample, 3% reported being COVID-19 positive and 15% were unsure of their status. This relatively high positive rate enabled us to conduct the analysis at the 5% significance level. At the time of the survey, 44% of the adults worked from home; 26% still went to work in their workplaces; 27% had stopped working due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3% were unemployed. Adults who exercised more were more likely to be COVID-19 negative. Each additional hour of exercise per day predicted a 78% increase in the likelihood of being COVID-19 negative. Adults with chronic medical illnesses were 48% more likely to be COVID-19 negative. In terms of work situation, those who worked from home were the most likely to be COVID-19 negative, and those who had stopped working were the most likely to be COVID-19 positive. Individuals in larger organizations were less likely to be COVID-19 positive. Given the testing shortage in many countries, we identify a novel approach to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection by a set of personal and work situation characteristics, in order to help to identify individuals with more or less risk of contracting the virus. We hope this research opens a new research avenue to identify the individual risk factors of COVID-19 infection to enable more targeted infectious disease prevention, communication, testing, and control to complement the effort to expand testing capacity.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen X.

We model the global pattern of trajectories of reported COVID-19 cases during the primary response period, with the aim of learning from the past to prepare for the future. Methods: Using Bayesian methods, we analyse the response to the COVID-19 outbreak for 158 countries for the period 22 January to 9 June 2020. This encompasses the period in which many countries imposed a variety of response measures and initial relaxation strategies. Instead of modelling specific intervention types and timings for each country explicitly, we adopt a stochastic epidemiological model including a feedback mechanism on virus transmission to capture complex nonlinear dynamics arising from continuous changes in community behaviour in response to rising case numbers. We analyse the overall effect of interventions and community responses across diverse regions. This approach mitigates explicit consideration of issues such as period of infectivity and public adherence to government restrictions. Results: Countries with the largest cumulative case tallies are characterised by a delayed response, whereas countries that avoid substantial community transmission during the period of study responded quickly. Countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher case identification rate and small numbers of undocumented community transmission at the early stages of the outbreak. We also demonstrate that uncertainty in numbers of undocumented infections dramatically impacts the risk of second waves. Our approach is also effective at pre-empting potential second waves and flare-ups. Conclusions: We demonstrate the utility of modelling to interpret community behaviour in the early epidemic stages. Two lessons learnt that are important for the future are: i) countries that imposed strict containment measures early in the epidemic fared better with respect to numbers of reported cases; and ii) broader testing is required early in the epidemic to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections and recover rapidly. We conclude that clear patterns of containment are essential prior to relaxation of restrictions and show that modelling can provide insights to this end.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David J.

Design: On-line cross-sectional survey. Setting: Data were collected between 20th and 22nd April. Participants: 6149 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. Main outcome measures: Perceived immunity to COVID-19, self-reported adherence to social distancing measures (going out for essential shopping, nonessential shopping, and meeting up with friends\/family; total out-of-home activity), worry about COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 to oneself and people in the UK. Knowledge that cough and high temperature \/ fever are the main symptoms of COVID-19. Results: In this sample, 1493 people (24.3%) thought they had had COVID-19. Only 245 (4.0%) reported receiving a test result saying they had COVID-19. Reported test results were often incongruent with participants' belief that they had had COVID-19. People who believed that they had had COVID-19 were: more likely to agree that they had some immunity to COVID-19; less likely to report adhering to social distancing measures; less worried about COVID-19; and less likely to know that cough and high temperature \/ fever are two of the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusions: The number of people in the UK who think they have already had COVID-19 is about twice the rate of current prevalence estimates. People who think that they have had COVID-19 may contribute to transmission of the virus through non-adherence to social distancing measures. Clear communications to this growing group are needed to explain why protective measures continue to be important and to encourage sustained adherence.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise E.

However, assuming that population immunity will build up through the epidemic, it is likely to rebound once these measures are relaxed, possibly leading to a second or multiple repeated lockdowns. In this report, we present results of epidemiological modelling that has helped inform policy making in France. We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in France, and examined the potential impact of post-quarantine measures, including social distancing, mask-wearing, and shielding of the population the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, on the disease's cumulative incidence and mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The model calibrated well and variation of model parameter values had little impact on outcome estimates. While quarantine is effective in containing the viral spread, it would be unlikely to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted, regardless of its duration. Both social distancing and mask-wearing, although effective in slowing the epidemic and in reducing mortality, would also be ineffective in ultimately preventing the overwhelming of ICUs and a second lockdown. However, these measures coupled with shielding of vulnerable people would be associated with better outcomes, including lower cumulative incidence, mortality, and maintaining an adequate number of ICU beds to prevent a second lockdown. Benefits would nonetheless be markedly reduced if these measures were not applied by most people or not maintained for a sufficiently long period, as herd immunity progressively establishes in the less vulnerable population.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Hoertel","author_inst":"AP-HP.Centre and Paris University"},{"author_name":"Martin Blachier","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Carlos Blanco","author_inst":"National Institute on Drug Abuse"},{"author_name":"Mark Olfson","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Marc Massetti","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Marina Sanchez Rico","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Frederic Limosin","author_inst":"AP-HP.Centre and Paris University"},{"author_name":"Henri Leleu","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Jalaj Garg","author_inst":"Medical College of Wisconsin"},{"author_name":"Stephen M.

There is a need for a reproducible and objective method to provide quantitative information for those scores. Purpose - Towards this goal, we present a retrospective study testing the ability of a deep learning algorithm at extracting features from chest x-rays (CXR) to track and predict radiological evolution. Materials and Methods - We trained a repurposed deep learning algorithm on the CheXnet open dataset (224,316 chest X-ray images of 65,240 unique patients) to extract features that mapped to radiological labels. We collected CXRs of COVID-19-positive patients from two open-source datasets (last accessed on April 9, 2020)(Italian Society for Medical and Interventional Radiology and MILA). Data collected form 60 pairs of sequential CXRs from 40 COVID patients (mean age +\/- standard deviation: 56 +\/- 13 years; 23 men, 10 women, seven not reported) and were categorized in three categories: Worse, Stable, or Improved on the basis of radiological evolution ascertained from images and reports. Receiver operating characteristic analyses, Mann-Whitney tests were performed. Results - On patients from the CheXnet dataset, the area under ROC curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.93 for seven imaging features and one diagnosis. Deep learning features between Worse and Improved outcome categories were significantly different for three radiological signs and one diagnostic (Consolidation, Lung Lesion, Pleural Effusion and Pneumonia; all P < 0.05). Features from the first CXR of each pair could correctly predict the outcome category between Worse and Improved cases with 82.7% accuracy. Conclusion - CXR deep learning features show promise for classifying the disease trajectory. Once validated in studies incorporating clinical data and with larger sample sizes, this information may be considered to inform triage decisions.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon Duchesne","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Daniel Gourdeau","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Patrick Archambault","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Carl Chartrand-Lefebvre","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Louis Dieumegarde","author_inst":"CERVO Brain Research Center"},{"author_name":"Reza Forghani","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Christian Gagne","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Hains","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"David Hornstein","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Huy Le","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Simon Lemieux","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Marie-Helene Levesque","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Diego Martin","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Lorne Rosenbloom","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"An Tang","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Vecchio","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Duchesne","author_inst":"Universite Laval"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086090","rel_title":"Incidence of COVID-19 in a cohort of adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with targeted biologic and synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086090","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in a cohort of adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases receiving targeted biologic and synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) and to explore the possible effect of these treatments in the clinical expression of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study comprising of a telephone survey and electronic health records review was performed including all adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs in a large rheumatology tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain. Demographics, disease activity, COVID-19 related symptoms and contact history data were obtained from the start of the 2020 pandemic. Cumulative incidence of confirmed cases (SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test) was compared to the population estimates for the same city districts from a governmental COVID-19 health database. Suspected cases were defined following WHO criteria and compared to those without compatible symptoms. RESULTS: 959 patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs were included. We identified 11 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the adult cohort and no confirmed positive cases in the paediatric cohort. All patients had a successful recovery and only one patient required admission in the intensive care unit. When using the same classification criteria (only COVID-19 positive cases with pneumonia), COVID-19 incidence rates of the rheumatic patient cohort were very similar to that of the general population [(0.48% (95% CI 0.09 to 8.65%)] and [0.58% (95% CI 5.62 to 5.99%)], respectively. We found significant differences in tDMARDs proportions between the suspected and non-suspected cases (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases on tDMARDs do not seem to present a higher risk of COVID-19 or a more severe disease outcome when compared to general population. Our exploratory analysis suggests that the proportion of COVID-19 suspected cases differs between tDMARDs.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xabier Michelena","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helena Borrell","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mireia Lopez-Corbeto","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Lopez-Lasanta","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Estefania Moreno","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Pascual-Pastor","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alba Erra","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayte Serrat","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Esther Espartal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susana Anton","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gustavo A Anez","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raquel Caparros-Ruiz","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea Pluma","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ernesto Trallero-Araguas","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mireia Barcelo-Bru","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"rheumatology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086462","rel_title":"Kidney Allograft Recipients Diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease-2019: A Single Center Report","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086462","rel_abs":"Background: Organ graft recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy are likely to be at heighted risk for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) and adverse outcomes including death.

Primary outcomes included recovery from Covid-19 symptoms, acute kidney injury, graft failure, and case fatality rate. Results: Of the 54 SARS-Cov-2 positive kidney transplant recipients, 39 with moderate to severe symptoms were admitted and 15 with mild symptoms were managed at home. Hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients were more likely to be male, of Hispanic ethnicity, and to have cardiovascular disease. At baseline, all but 2 were receiving tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and 32 were on a steroid free immunosuppression regimen. Tacrolimus dosage was reduced in 46% of hospitalized patients and maintained at baseline level in the non-hospitalized cohort. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosage was maintained at the baseline dosage in 11% of hospitalized patients and 64% of non-hospitalized patients, and was stopped in 61% hospitalized patients and 0% in the non-hospitalized cohort. Azithromycin or doxycycline were prescribed at a similar rate among hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients (38% vs. 40%). Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed in 79% of hospitalized patients and only one of 15 non-hospitalized patients. Acute kidney injury occurred in 51% of hospitalized patients. Patients with severe disease were more likely to have elevations in inflammatory biomarkers at presentation. At a median of 21 days follow up, 67% of patients have had their symptoms resolved or improved and 33% have persistent symptoms. Graft failure requiring hemodialysis occurred in 3 of 39 hospitalized patients (8%). Three of 39 (8%) hospitalized patients expired and none of the 15 non-hospitalized patients expired. Conclusions: Clinical presentation of Covid-19 in kidney transplant recipients was similar to what has been described in the general population. The case fatality rate in our entire cohort of 54 kidney transplant recipients was reassuringly low and patients with mild symptomology could be successfully managed at home. Data from the pilot study suggest that a strategy of systematic screening and triage to inpatient or outpatient care, close monitoring, and judicious use of immunosuppressive drugs rather than cessation is beneficial.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle Lubetzky","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian, Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Meredith Aull","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Craig-Shapiro","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Jun Lee","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"John Lee","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Samuel Sultan","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Jehon Marku-Podvorica","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Laura Gingras","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Rosy Priya Kodiyanplakkal","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Choli Hartono","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Stuart Saal","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Thangamani Muthukumar","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Sandip Kapur","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Manikkam Suthanthiran","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Darshana Dadhania","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"transplantation"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086447","rel_title":"Evaluation of effects of public health interventions on COVID-19 transmission for Pakistan: A mathematical simulation study","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086447","rel_abs":"Background: In an effort to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, many governments across the world have enforced lockdown or social distancing measures. Several outbreak models have been developed to investigate the effects of different public health strategies for COVID-19, but they have not been developed for Pakistan and other South East Asian countries, where a large proportion of global population resides. Methods: We developed a stochastic individual contact model by extending the widely-used Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment model with additional compartments to model both anticipated mitigating effects of public health intervention strategies for Pakistan. We estimated the projected spread, number of hospitalizations, and case fatalities under no intervention and four increasingly stringent public health strategies of social distancing and self-isolation at the national and provincial levels of Pakistan. Results: Our analysis shows that without any public health interventions the expected number of cumulative case fatalities is 671,596 in Pakistan with the virus is expected to peak in terms of the number of required ICU-hospitalizations at 198,593 persons by the end of the June 2020. The estimated total numbers of cumulative case fatalities are lower for other public health strategies with strict social distancing showing the lowest number of deaths at 1,588 (Self-isolation: n=341,359; Flexible social distancing strategy: n=3,995; and Exit strategy: n=28,214). The lowest number of required ICU-hospitalization is also estimated for strict social distancing strategy (n=266 persons at the end of May 2020). Generally, the simulated effects of the different public health strategies at the provincial-level were similar to the national-level with strict social distancing showing the fewest number of case fatalities and ICU-hospitalizations. Conclusion: Our results indicate that case fatalities and ICU-hospitalizations for Pakistan will be high without any public health interventions. While strict social distancing can potentially prevent a large number of deaths and ICU-hospitalizations, the government faces an important dilemma of potentially severe economic downfall. Consideration of a temporary strict social distancing strategy with gradual return of the lower-risk Pakistani population, as simulated in our exit strategy scenario, may an effective compromise between public health and economy of Pakistani population.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zulfiqar A Bhutta","author_inst":"Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Ofir Harari","author_inst":"Cytel Inc"},{"author_name":"Jay JH Park","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Noor Zannat","author_inst":"Cytel Inc"},{"author_name":"Michael Zoratti","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Timothy Churches","author_inst":"South Western Sydney Clinical School, UNSW Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kristian Thorlund","author_inst":"Cytel Inc"},{"author_name":"Edward J Mills","author_inst":"Cytel Inc"},{"author_name":"Rosy Priya Kodiyanplakkal","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Choli Hartono","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Stuart Saal","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Thangamani Muthukumar","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Sandip Kapur","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Manikkam Suthanthiran","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Darshana Dadhania","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086553","rel_title":"Social Media Platforms for Health Communication and Research in the Face of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross Sectional Survey in Uganda.","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086553","rel_abs":"Objectives: (1) To examine the usage of social media and other forms of media among medical students (MS) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Uganda. (2) To assess the perceived usefulness of social media and other forms of media for COVID-19 public health campaigns. Design: A descriptive WhatsApp messenger-based cross-sectional survey in April 2020. Setting: Makerere University Teaching Hospitals (MUTH) and 9 of the 10 medical schools in Uganda. Participants: HCPs at MUTH and MS in the 9 medical schools in Uganda. Main outcome measures: We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, sources of information on COVID-19, preferences of social media platform and perceived usefulness of the different media platforms for acquisition of knowledge on COVID-19. Results: Overall, response rate was 21.5% for both MS and HCPs. In total, 877 (HCPS [136, 15.5%], MS [741, 85.5%]) were studied. Majority (n=555, 63.3%) were male with a median age of 24 (range: 18-66) years. Social media was a source of information for 665 (75.8%) participants. Usage was similar among MS and HCPs (565\/741 (76.2%) vs. 100\/136 (73.5%), p=0.5). Among the MS, commonly used social media were: WhatsApp (n=705, 95.1%) Facebook (n=405, 54.8%), Twitter (n=290, 39.1%), Instagram (n=178, 24.0) and Telegram (n=80, 10.8%). Except for WhatsApp, male MS we more likely to use the other social media platforms (p= <0.001 to 0.01). Mass media (television and radio) and social media were preferred the most useful tools for dissemination of COVID-19 related information. Conclusion: More than two-thirds of MS and HCPs are routinely using social media in Uganda. Social media platforms may be used for dissemination of information as well as a research tool among MS and HCPs. Social media alongside other media platforms can also be used as sources of reliable information on COVID-19 as well as for dissemination of research findings and guidelines.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ronald Olum","author_inst":"College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda."},{"author_name":"Felix Bongomin","author_inst":"1.

This increase was observed in patients with mild symptoms and not further augmented in patients with severe symptoms. In patients who recovered, CEPs decreased, but were in a range still significantly higher than normal controls.

Both mild and severe Covid-19 patients had significantly more viable CECs compared to healthy controls.

A report from April 29 revealed 1.26 million confirmed cases and 125 928 deaths in Europe. This study proposed a novel deep neural network framework, COVID-19Net, which parallelly combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs). Three European countries with severe outbreaks were studied Germany, Italy, and Spain to extract spatiotemporal feature and predict the number of confirmed cases. The prediction results acquired from COVID-19Net were compared to those obtained using a CNN, GRU, and CNN-GRU. The mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error, which are commonly used model assessment indices, were used to compare the accuracy of the models. The results verified that COVID-19Net was notably more accurate than the other models. The mean absolute percentage error generated by COVID-19Net was 1.447 for Germany, 1.801 for Italy, and 2.828 for Spain, which were considerably lower than those of the other models. This indicated that the proposed framework can accurately predict the accumulated number of confirmed cases in the three countries and serve as a crucial reference for devising public health strategies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chiou-Jye Huang","author_inst":"Jiangxi University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yamin Shen","author_inst":"Jiangxi University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ping-Huan Kuo","author_inst":"National Pingtung University"},{"author_name":"Yung-Hsiang Chen","author_inst":"National Pingtung University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Paola Cremonesi","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology"},{"author_name":"Jessica Quarna","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology"},{"author_name":"Sonia Caccia","author_inst":"Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cogliati","author_inst":"Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francesco Bertolini","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology"},{"author_name":"Choli Hartono","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Stuart Saal","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Thangamani Muthukumar","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Sandip Kapur","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Manikkam Suthanthiran","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Darshana Dadhania","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20075507","rel_title":"Clinical and Genetic Characteristics of Covid-19 Patients from UK Biobank","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20075507","rel_abs":"We conducted an analysis of 669 Covid-19 positive patients within the UK Biobank cohort, a prospective cohort including over 500,000 participants.

METHODS: The literature exploration lasted up to 18 April 2020 and through PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library we have identified 10 pertinent publications. To paraphrase the outcomes of autonomous researches, we have performed a random-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2272 patients' information was extracted from the selected literature. We have found sex (male) (Risk ratio [RR] =1.29 [1.07; 1.54]), hypertension (RR=1.79 [1.57; 2.04]), diabetes (RR=1.57 [1.25; 1.98]), fatigue or myalgia (RR=1.17 [1.02; 1.35]), and smoking history (RR=1.71 [1.25; 2.35]) are potential risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. We found fever (RR=1.21 [0.66 to 2.22]), cough ([1.13,[0.98 to 1.30]), and diarrhea (RR=1.14 [0.93 to 1.40]) as insignificant risk factors for COVID-19 severity.

with COVID-19 have demonstrated markedly dysregulated coagulation and a high risk of morbid arterial and venous thrombotic events. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described in patients with COVID-19, their potential role in COVID-19-associated thrombosis remains unknown. Objectives: To elucidate the potential role of hyperactive neutrophils and NET release in COVID-19-associated thrombosis. Patients\/Methods: This is a retrospective, case-control study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed thrombosis (n=11), as compared with gender- and age-matched COVID-19 patients without clinical thrombosis (n=33). In addition to capturing clinical data, we measured remnants of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil-derived S100A8\/A9 (calprotectin) in patient sera. Results: The majority of patients (9\/11) were receiving at least prophylactic doses of heparinoids at the time thrombosis was diagnosed. As compared with controls, patients with COVID-19-associated thrombosis had significantly higher blood levels of markers of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil activation (calprotectin). The thrombosis group also had higher levels of D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and platelets, but not troponin or neutrophils. Finally, there were strong associations between markers of hyperactive neutrophils (calprotectin and cell-free DNA) and D-dimer. Conclusion: Elevated levels of neutrophil activation and NET formation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are associated with higher risk of morbid thrombotic complications. These observations underscore the need for urgent investigation into the potential relationship between NETs and unrelenting thrombosis in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Melanie Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Srilakshmi Yalavarthi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Gockman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A.

We show that it is possible to estimate the number of positive, unconfirmed COVID-19 cases using a simple, long-established method employed by demographers to estimate a population in the absence of a census count. We go on to show how a confidence interval can be constructed around an estimate of positive, unconfirmed COVID-19 cases constructed from this method, using Whatcom County, Washington as a case study.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David A Swanson","author_inst":"University of California Riverside"},{"author_name":"Ronald E.

The objective of this study was to compare concerns about COVID-19 among individuals undergoing cancer treatment to those with a history of cancer not currently receiving therapy and to those without a cancer history. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional anonymous online survey study of adults currently residing in the United States. Participants were recruited over a one-week period (April 3-11, 2020) using promoted advertisements on Facebook and Twitter. Groups were compared using chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact tests, and t-tests. Results 543 respondents from 47 states provided information on their cancer history and were included in analyses. Participants receiving active treatment reported greater concern about coronavirus infection (p<0.0001), higher levels of family distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.004), and greater concern that the general public does not adequately understand the seriousness of COVID-19 (p=0.04). Those with metastatic disease were more likely to indicate that COVID-19 had negatively affected their cancer care compared to patients with non-metastatic cancer (50.8% vs. 31.0%; p=0.02). The most commonly reported treatment modifications included chemotherapy delays. Conclusions Patients undergoing active treatment for cancer were most concerned about the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the logistics as well as potential efficacy of ongoing cancer treatment, longer term effects, and overarching societal concerns that the population at large is not as concerned about the public health implications of the coronavirus.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emil Lou","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Deanna Teoh","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Katherine Brown","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Anne Blaes","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Shernan G.
