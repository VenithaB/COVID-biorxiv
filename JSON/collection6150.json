By identifying and critically synthesizing 42 recent peer-reviewed studies employing capsid integrity qPCR for viruses in the last decade (2009 to 2019) in the fields of food safety and environmental virology, we aimed to establish recommendations for the detection of infectious viruses. Intercalating dyes are effective measures of viability in PCR assays provided the viral capsid is damaged; viruses that have been inactivated by other causes, such as loss of attachment or genomic damage, are less well detected using this approach. Although optimizing specific protocols for each virus is recommended, we identify a framework for general assay conditions. These include concentrations of ethidium monoazide, propidium monoazide or its derivates between 10 and 200 uM; incubation on ice or at room temperature (20 to 25C) for 5 to 120 min; and dye activation using LED or high light (500 to 800 Watts) exposure for periods ranging from 5 to 20 min. These simple steps can benefit the investigation of infectious virus transmission in routine (water) monitoring settings and during viral outbreaks such as the current COVID-19 pandemic or endemic diseases like dengue fever.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mats Leifels","author_inst":"Singapore Centre for Life Science Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Cheng Dan","author_inst":"Singapore Centre for Life Science Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Sozzi","author_inst":"Gillings School of Global Public Health, Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA"},{"author_name":"David C Shoults","author_inst":"Civil and Resource Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Stefan Wuertz","author_inst":"School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Singapore Centre for Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Skorn Mongkolsuk","author_inst":"Research Laboratory of Biotechnology, Chulabhorn Research Institute and Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology, CHE, Ministry of Education,"},{"author_name":"Kwanrawee Sirikanchana","author_inst":"Research Laboratory of Biotechnology, Chulabhorn Research Institute and Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology, CHE, Ministry of Education,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094748","rel_title":"COVID-19 Outbreak, Social Response, and Early Economic Effects: A Global VAR Analysis of Cross-Country Interdependencies","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094748","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of countries' interconnections in understanding and reacting to the spread of the virus. This paper uses a global model with a sample of 41 countries to study the interdependencies between COVID-19 health shocks, populations' risk perceptions about the disease, and their social distancing responses; it also provides some early evidence about potential economic effects. Social networks are a central component in understanding the international transmission. We exploit a dataset on existing social connections across country borders, made available by Facebook, and show that social networks help explain not only the spread of the disease, but also cross-country spillovers in risk perceptions and in social behavior. Social distancing responses across countries are measured based on aggregated mobility tracking indicators, obtained from Google Mobility Reports. We estimate a Global VAR (GVAR) model, which allows for endogeneity of each health, social, and economic, domestic variable, and for a dependence of domestic variables on country-specific foreign aggregates, which depend in turn on the matrix of social connections. Our empirical results highlight the importance of cross-country interdependencies and social networks. Risk perceptions and social responses are affected by experiences abroad, with Italy and the U.S. playing large roles in our sample. The social distancing responses to domestic health shocks are heterogeneous across countries, but they share some similarities: they adjust only gradually and with delay, hence displaying adaptive behavior. Early indicators are suggestive of unemployment consequences that vary widely across countries, depending on their labor market characteristics. Unemployment is particularly responsive to health shocks in the U.S. and Spain, while the fluctuations are attenuated almost everywhere else.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabio Milani","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Cheng Dan","author_inst":"Singapore Centre for Life Science Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Sozzi","author_inst":"Gillings School of Global Public Health, Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA"},{"author_name":"David C Shoults","author_inst":"Civil and Resource Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Stefan Wuertz","author_inst":"School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Singapore Centre for Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Skorn Mongkolsuk","author_inst":"Research Laboratory of Biotechnology, Chulabhorn Research Institute and Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology, CHE, Ministry of Education,"},{"author_name":"Kwanrawee Sirikanchana","author_inst":"Research Laboratory of Biotechnology, Chulabhorn Research Institute and Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology, CHE, Ministry of Education,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094573","rel_title":"Development and validation of the COVID-19 severity index (CSI): a prognostic tool for early respiratory decompensation","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094573","rel_abs":"Objective: The goal of this study was to create a predictive model of early hospital respiratory decompensation among patients with COVID-19. Design: Observational, retrospective cohort study. Setting: Nine-hospital health system within the Northeastern United States. Populations: Adult patients ([&ge;] 18 years) admitted from the emergency department who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) up to 24 hours after initial presentation. Patients meeting criteria for critical respiratory illness within 4 hours of arrival were excluded. Main outcome and performance measures: We used a composite endpoint of respiratory critical illness as defined by oxygen requirement beyond low-flow nasal cannula (e.g., non-rebreather mask, high-flow nasal cannula, bi-level positive pressure ventilation), intubation, or death within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. We developed predictive models using patient demographic and clinical data collected during those first 4 hours. Eight hospitals were used for development and internal validation (n=932) and 1 hospital for model external validation (n=240). Predictive variables were identified using an ensemble approach that included univariate regression, random forest, logistic regression with LASSO, Chi-square testing, gradient boosting information gain, and gradient boosting Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values prior to manual curation. We generated two predictive models, a quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) that uses only exam and vital sign measurements, and a COVID-19 severity index (CSI) machine learning model. Using area under receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC), precision-recall curves (AU-PRC) and calibration metrics, we compare the qCSI and CSI to three illness scoring systems: Elixhauser mortality score, qSOFA, and CURB-65. We present performance of qCSI and CSI on an external validation cohort. Results: During the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 27, 2020, 1,792 patients were admitted with COVID-19. Six-hundred and twenty patients were excluded based on age or critical illness within the first 4 hours, yielding 1172 patients in the final cohort. Of these patients, 144 (12.3%) met the composite endpoint within the first 24 hours. The qCSI (AU-ROC: 0.90 [0.85-0.96]) comprised of nasal cannula flow rate, respiratory rate, and minimum documented pulse oximetry outperformed the baseline models (qSOFA: 0.76 [0.69-0.85]; Elixhauser: 0.70 [0.62-0.80]; CURB-65: AU-ROC 0.66 [0.58-0.77]) and was validated on an external cohort (AU-ROC: 0.82). The machine learning-based CSI had superior performance on the training cohort (AU-ROC: 0.91 [0.86-0.97]), but was unlikely to provide practical improvements in clinical settings. Conclusions: A significant proportion of admitted COVID-19 patients decompensate within 24 hours of hospital presentation and these events are accurately predicted using respiratory exam findings within a simple scoring system.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian Haimovich","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Neal G Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Stoytcho Stoytchev","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"H Patrick Young","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francis P Wilson","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wade L Schulz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Andrew Taylor","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20092080","rel_title":"SELF-POLICING COVID-19 AND CIVIC RESPONSIBILITIES IN LAGOS METROPOLIS, NIGERIA","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20092080","rel_abs":"This study investigated self-policing COVID-19 and civic responsibilities in Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria adopting an online qualitative interview due to the current lockdown that denied field (face to face) interview.

We evaluate the expected impact of reopening schools in lIe-de-France region after the withdrawal of lockdown currently scheduled for May 11, 2020. We explore several scenarios of partial, progressive, or full school reopening, coupled with moderate social distancing interventions and large-scale tracing, testing, and isolation. Accounting for current uncertainty on the role of children in COVID-19 epidemic, we test different hypotheses on children's transmissibility distinguishing between younger children (pre-school and primary school age) and adolescents (middle and high school age). Reopening schools after lifting lockdown will likely lead to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the following 2 months, even with lower transmissibility of children, yet protocols exist that would allow maintaining the epidemic under control without saturating the healthcare system. With pre-schools and primary schools in session starting May 11, ICU occupation would reach at most 72% [55,83]% (95% probability ranges) of a 1,500-bed capacity (here foreseen as the routine capacity restored in the region post-first wave) if no other school level reopens before summer or if middle and high schools reopen one month later through a progressive protocol (increasing attendance week by week). Full attendance of adolescents at school starting in June would overwhelm the ICU system (138% [118,159]% occupation). Reopening all schools on May 11 would likely lead to a second wave similar to the one recently experienced, except if maximum attendance is limited to 50% for both younger children and adolescents. Based on the estimated situation on May 11, no substantial difference in the epidemic risk is predicted between progressive and prompt reopening of pre-schools and primary schools, thus allowing full attendance of younger children mostly in need of resuming learning and development. Reopening would require however large-scale trace and testing to promptly isolate cases, in addition to moderate social distancing interventions. Full attendance in middle and high schools is instead not recommended. Findings are consistent across different assumptions on the relative transmissibility of younger children and for small increase of the reproductive number possibly due to decreasing compliance to lockdown.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Di Domenico","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Chiara E.

Methods We thus challenged environmental versus genetic evolution models of COVID-19 spreading, in the largest epidemiological analysis conducted as yet. This was performed over 168,089 laboratory-confirmed infection cases in Italy, Spain and Scandinavia. Landmark dates were set for each of the countries analyzed at peak diffusion rates this date, and the doubling time versus cumulative number of diagnoses was computed. Diffusion data in Germany, France and UK constituted the validation dataset of our model, over 210,239 additional cases. Mutations and mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 versus COVID-19 spreading were analyzed at nextstrain.org\/ncov\/europe. Results The mean doubling time of COVID-19 was 6.63 days in northern Italy, 5.87 days in central areas, and 5.38 days in southern Italy, for shorter COVID-19 doubling time in warmer regions. Spain extended this trend, with a mean COVID-19 doubling time of 4.2 days. Slower diffusion across progressively colder regions was observed in Scandinavia, with 9.4 days COVID-19 doubling time in Sweden, 10.8 days in Finland and 12.95 days in Norway. Such diffusion model was supported by SARS-CoV-2 mutation strings upon sequential diffusion across the North\/South gradient. Conclusions Our findings indicate COVID-19 association to a sharp North\/South climate gradient, with faster spreading in southern regions. Thus, warmer climate conditions may not limit SARS-CoV-2 diffusion. Very cold regions may be better spared by recurrent courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saverio Alberti","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Roberta Di Pietro","author_inst":"University of Chieti-Pescara"},{"author_name":"Mariangela Basile","author_inst":"University of Chieti-Pescara"},{"author_name":"Laura Antolini","author_inst":"University of Milano Bicocca"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wade L Schulz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Andrew Taylor","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095273","rel_title":"Evolution of the COVID Pandemic: A Technique for Mathematical Analysis of Data","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095273","rel_abs":"The analysis of COVID-19 statistics in different regions of the world with the intention of understanding the trend of progression of the pandemic is a task of paramount importance.

Methods: We report preliminary results from the Vall dHebron prospective cohort study at Vall dHebron University Hospital, in Barcelona (Spain), including all consecutive patients who had a confirmed infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARSCoV2) and who were treated with tocilizumab until March 25th. The primary endpoint was mortality at 7 days after tocilizumab administration. Secondary endpoints were admission to the intensive care unit, development of ARDS and respiratory insufficiency among others. Results: 82 patients with COVID19 received at least one dose of tocilizumab. The mean (SD) age was 59.1 (19.8) years, 63% were male, 22% were of non Spanish ancestry, and the median (IQR) ageadjusted Charlson index at baseline was 3 (1 to 4) points. Respiratory failure and ARDS developed in 62 (75.6%) and 45 (54.9%) patients, respectively. Median time from symptom onset to ARDS development was 8 (5 to 11) days. The median time from symptom onset to the first dose of tocilizumab was 9 (7 to 11) days. Mortality at 7 days was 26.8%. Hazard ratio for mortality was 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5 (age adjusted hazard ratio for mortality 2.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 5.8) if tocilizumab was administered after the onset of ARDS. Conclusion: Time from lung injury onset to tocilizumab administration may be critical to patient recovery. Our preliminary data could inform bedside decisions until more data from clinical trials becomes available.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian Sanchez-Montalva","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Department, Global Health and Tuberculosis Unit, National Referral Center for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Julia Selares-Nadal","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Juan Espinosa-Pereiro","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Department, Global Health and Tuberculosis Unit, National Referral Center for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Nuria Fernandez-Hidalgo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Department, Cardiovascular Infections Unit"},{"author_name":"Santiago Perez-Hoyos","author_inst":"Vall d'HebronResearch Institute, Statistics and Bioinformatics Unit"},{"author_name":"Fernando Salvador","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Department, Global Health and Tuberculosis Unit, National Referral Center for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Xavier Dura-Miralles","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Marta Miarons","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Hospital Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Andres Anton","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Micriobiology Depratment"},{"author_name":"Simeon Eremiev","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Abiu Sempere-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Pau Bosch-Nicolau","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Department, Global Health and Tuberculosis Unit, National Referral Center for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Arnau Monforte-Pallares","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Salvador Augustin","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Hepatology Department"},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095018","rel_title":"Clinical Course and Risk Factors for Recurrence of Positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA: A Retrospective Cohort Study from Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095018","rel_abs":"Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a full-blown global pandemic. It has been reported that patients with COVID-19 meeting the criteria for hospital discharge (including two consecutive negative RT-PCR results) have experienced recurrent PCR positivity. However, the clinical course and risk factors for these patients have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, consecutive patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR from the Guanggu Branch of Hubei Province Maternity and Childcare Hospital from February 24, 2020 to March 31, 2020 were enrolled. The epidemiological, radiographic, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from medical records. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to elucidate risk factors for patients with recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results 1087 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Of these, 20 (1.8%) died and 1067 (98.2%) were discharged from the hospital. Among the discharged cases, there were 81 (7.6%) patients found to develop a repeat positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA result. Older age was obviously associated with death. For patients with recurrent RT-PCR positivity, the median duration from illness onset to onset of complete RNA negative was 33.0 days (range, 6.0-82.0 days; IQR, 20.0-41.0 days), while that from illness onset to recurrence was 50.0 days (range, 21.0-95.0 days; IQR, 36.5-59.5 days). Multivariate regression analysis identified recurrence of positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA was associated with elevated IL-6 levels (P=0.004, OR=3.050; 95% CI, 1.432-6.499), increased lymphocyte count (P=0.038, OR=2.321; 95% CI, 1.048-5.138) and CT imaging features of lung consolidation (P=0.038, OR=1.641; 95% CI, 1.028-2.620) during hospitalization. Conclusion Elevated lymphocyte counts and IL-6 levels in blood, and consolidation features on CT imaging are useful risk factors for clinicians to identify patients at risk of developing recurrent positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This is speculated to be caused by a balance in immune regulation when fighting virus toxicity. For patients with a high risk of recurrent positivity, a prolonged observation and additional preventative measures should be implemented for at least 50 days after illness onset to prevent future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Chen","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Xu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Jing Hu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Qiangda Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Fengfeng Xu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Hui Liang","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Nanmei Liu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Hengmei Zhu","author_inst":"Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Naval Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinlong Lan","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Lan Zhou","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Jiajun Xing","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ning Pu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Cai","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Salvador Augustin","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Hepatology Department"},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094839","rel_title":"Compassionate drug (mis)use during pandemics: lessons for COVID-19 from 2009.","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094839","rel_abs":"Background: New emerging infections have no known treatment. Assessing potential drugs for safety and efficacy enables clinicians to make evidence-based treatment decisions, and contributes to overall outbreak control. However, it is difficult to launch clinical trials in the unpredictable environment of an outbreak. We conducted a bibliometric systematic review for the 2009 influenza pandemic to determine the speed, and quality of evidence generation for treatments. This informs approaches to high-quality evidence generation in this and future pandemics. Methods: We searched PubMed for all clinical data (including clinical trial, observational and case series) describing treatment for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and ClinicalTrials.gov for research that aimed to enrol patients with the disease. Results: 33869 treatment courses for patients hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detailed in 160 publications. Most were retrospective observational studies or case series. 592 patients received treatment (or placebo) as participants in a registered interventional clinical trial with results publicly available. None of these registered trial results were available during the timeframe of the pandemic, and the median date of publication was 213 days after the Public Health Emergency of International Concern ended. Conclusion: Patients were frequently treated for pandemic influenza with drugs not registered for this indication, but rarely under circumstances of high-quality data capture. The result was a reliance on use under compassionate circumstances, resulting in continued uncertainty regarding the potential benefits and harms of anti-viral treatment. Rapid scaling of clinical trials is critical for generating a quality evidence base during pandemics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda Rojek","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Genevieve Martin","author_inst":"Alfred Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter Horby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Qiangda Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Fengfeng Xu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Hui Liang","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Nanmei Liu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Hengmei Zhu","author_inst":"Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Naval Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinlong Lan","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Lan Zhou","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Jiajun Xing","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ning Pu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Cai","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Salvador Augustin","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Hepatology Department"},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094805","rel_title":"Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces and in human excreta","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094805","rel_abs":"At room temperature, SARS-CoV-2 was stable on environmental surfaces and remained viable up to 7 days on smooth surfaces.

The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 has been reported; however, there are limited researches that investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in the Middle East. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical, radiological and therapeutic characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID19 in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This study is a retrospective single-centre case series study. We extracted data for patients who were admitted to the Al-Noor Specialist hospital with a PCR confirmed SARS-COV-2 between 12th and 31st of March 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patients characteristics. Continuous data were reported as mean (SD). Chi-squared test\/Fisher test were used as appropriate to compare proportions for categorical variables. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were hospitalised for COVID-19 during the study period. The mean age was 46.1 years (SD: 15.3 years). Around 61.0% (n= 90) were males and six patients (3.9%) reported working in the healthcare sector. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (28.8%, n= 42) and diabetes mellitus (26.0%, n= 38). The majority of the patients, 64.4% (n = 96) had a recent contact history with a COVID patient. Regarding the severity of the hospitalised patients, 105 patients (70.0%) were mild, 29 (19.3%) were moderate, and 16 patients (10.7%) were severe or required ICU care. From the 105 mild patients, around 31.3% (n= 47) were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: This case series provides clinical, radiological and therapeutic characteristics of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed Shabrawishi","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Manal M Al-Gethamy","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Abdallah Y Naser","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy, Isra University, Amman, Jordan."},{"author_name":"Mahe A Ghazawi","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ghaidaa F Alsharif","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Elaf F Obaid","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Haitham A Melebari","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, King Faisal General Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095042","rel_title":"Lactate arterial-central venous gradient among COVID-19 patients in ICU: a potential tool in the clinical practice.","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095042","rel_abs":"Objective. In physiological conditions arterial blood lactate concentration is equal or lower than central venous. The aim of this study was to explore if the COVID-19 induced lung cells damage was mirrored by an arterial lactatemia higher than the central venous one; then if the administration of immunosuppressant drugs (i.e. canakinumab) could normalize such abnormal lactate a-cv difference. Methods. Prospective cohort study started on March 25th 2020 for a duration of 10 days, enrolling 21 patients affected by severe COVID-19 pneumonia undergoing mechanical ventilation consecutively admitted to the ICU of the Rimini Hospital, Italy. Arterial and central venous blood samples were contemporary collected to calculate the difference between arterial and central venous lactate (Delta a-cv lactate) concentration within 24 h from tracheal intubation (T0), and 24 hours after canakinumab administration (T1). Results. At the T0 19\/21 (90.5%) patients showed a pathologic Delta a-cv lactate (median 0.22 mmol\/L; IQR 0.07-0.36), suggesting severe inflammation. In the 13 patients undergoing canakinumab administration, at the T1 Delta a-cv lactate decreased in 92.3% of cases, being the decrease statistically significant (T0: median 0.15, IQR 0.07-0.25 mmol\/L; T1: median -0.01, IQR -0.09-0.04 mmol\/L; p=0.002). Conclusion. A reversed Delta a-cv lactate is likely to be one of the effects of COVID-19 related cytokine storm, that could reflect a derangement in the lung cells mitochondrial metabolism induced by inflammation or other uncoupling mediators. Delta a-cv lactate decrease may reflect the anti-inflammatory activity of canakinumab. Our preliminary findings need to be confirmed by larger outcome studies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Sanson","author_inst":"University of Trieste (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Lucia Tassinari","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Guiotto","author_inst":"AORN San Pio, Benevento (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Antonella Potalivo","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Montomoli","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Fernando Schiraldi","author_inst":"San Paolo Hospital, Naples (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20094979","rel_title":"Estimation of the number of general anesthesia cases based on a series of nationwide surveys on Twitter during COVID-19 in Japan: A statistical analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20094979","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has since spread to more than 200 other countries at the time of writing.

The new virus is rapidly spreading in humans and cases of severe acute respiratory syndromes are being reported worldwide. Health authority advisors and governments from small towns to large countries need to quickly manage and deal with growing epidemiological data on a daily basis. In this work, current available data from reported cases and deaths over time were analyzed and treated. Lethality has been calculated by finding linearization of death cases against reported ones, using a time-delayed data transposition. A two-wave statistical model, 2WM, based on the superposition of normal distributions was used to fit current data and to estimate the evolution of infections and deaths, using Microsoft Excel(R). The model showed good agreement even for apparent single wave behavior in some countries and can easily be extended to any number of waves. A gamma distribution was used as a risk function to estimate death probability from patient admission to reported death. Evolution of fatality cases over time can then be estimated from the model with reasonable accuracy. Data from South Korea, China, Australia, Germany, Italy and Spain were used to validate the model. Data from The United States, United Kingdom and Brazil were used to study the epidemiology as the pandemic progresses. Additionally, the 2WM was applied to world data and to the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. The model was implemented in MS-Excel, a popular and easy to use analytical tool. A template spreadsheet is provided as supplementary material. Constant lethality can be determined from the initial stage of the pandemic wave. Values ranged from 1.7% to 15.3%, depending on the degree of possible sub notification cases. Even for places with low testing, a linear relationship can be found. The two-wave model can be fine-tuned to properly adjust the data. The second wave pattern was estimated according to the first wave parameter. The accuracy for estimating COVID-19 evolution was compared to the classic SIR model with good agreement. According to the model, based on current trends, health protocols and policies, approximately 10,000,000 cases and 860,000 deaths will be recorded worldwide. Approximately 99% of that number would be reached by the end of July 2020 given constant conditions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agenor De Noni Jr.","author_inst":"Federal University of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Bernando Araldi da Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Felipe Dal-Pizzol","author_inst":"University of the Extreme South of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Luismar Marques Porto","author_inst":"Federal University of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Antonella Potalivo","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Montomoli","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Fernando Schiraldi","author_inst":"San Paolo Hospital, Naples (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095505","rel_title":"Significant Relaxation of SARS-CoV-2-Targeted Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions Will Result in Profound Mortality: A New York State Modelling Study","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095505","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is the most significant global health crisis of the 21st century.

Simulations revealed dramatic infectivity driven by undocumented infections, and a peak basic reproductive number in NYS of 5.7. NPIs have been effective, and relaxation >50% will result in tens-of-thousands more deaths. Endemic infection is likely to occur in the absence of profound sustained immunity.

The number of cases follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion; we chose as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and we used 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth. We looked then for linear correlations of the exponents with other variables, for a sample of 126 countries. We find a positive correlation, faster spread of COVID-19 , with high confidence level with the following variables, with respective p-value: low Temperature (4x10 -7), high ratio of old vs. working-age people (3x10 -6), life expectancy (8x10 -6), number of international tourists (1x10 -5), earlier epidemic starting date (2x10 -5), high level of physical contact in greeting habits (6x10 -5), lung cancer prevalence (6x10 -5), obesity in males (1x10 -4), share of population in urban areas (2x10 -4), cancer prevalence (3x10 -4), alcohol consumption (0.0019), daily smoking prevalence (0.0036), UV index (0.004, smaller sample, 73 countries), low Vitamin D serum levels (0.002-0.006, smaller sample, 50 countries). There is highly significant correlation also with blood type: positive correlation with types RH- (2x10 -5) and A+ (2x10 -3), negative correlation with B+ (2x10 -4). We also find positive correlation with moderate confidence level (p-value of 0.02-0.03) with: CO2\/SO emissions, type-1 diabetes in children, low vaccination coverage for Tuberculosis (BCG). Several of the above variables are correlated with each other and so they are likely to have common interpretations. Other variables are found to have a counterintuitive negative correlation, which may be explained due their strong negative correlation with life expectancy: slower spread of COVID-19 is correlated with high death-rate due to pollution, prevalence of anemia and hepatitis B, high blood pressure in females. We also analyzed the possible existence of a bias: countries with low GDP-per capita, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing and we discuss correlation with the above variables.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessio Notari","author_inst":"Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Torrieri","author_inst":"Unicamp, Campinas, SP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"George A Kastis","author_inst":"Academy of Athens"},{"author_name":"Luismar Marques Porto","author_inst":"Federal University of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Antonella Potalivo","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Montomoli","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Fernando Schiraldi","author_inst":"San Paolo Hospital, Naples (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095356","rel_title":"Global analysis of daily new COVID-19 cases reveals many static-phase countries including US and UK potentially with unstoppable epidemics","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095356","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 epidemics are differentially progressing in different countries.

Furthermore, these static-phase countries are overall significantly lower in testing density but higher in the level of positive COVID-19 tests than downward countries. These findings suggest that the testing capacity in static-phase countries is lagging behind the spread of the outbreak, i.e., daily new cases (confirmed) are likely less than daily new infections and the remaining undocumented infections are thus still expanding, resulting in unstoppable epidemics. As such, increasing the testing capacity and\/or reducing the COVID-19 transmission are urgently needed to stop the severing crisis in static-phase countries.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"XINMIAO FU","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Torrieri","author_inst":"Unicamp, Campinas, SP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"George A Kastis","author_inst":"Academy of Athens"},{"author_name":"Luismar Marques Porto","author_inst":"Federal University of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Antonella Potalivo","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Montomoli","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Fernando Schiraldi","author_inst":"San Paolo Hospital, Naples (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20093989","rel_title":"Systematic benefit-risk assessment for the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19: Establishing a framework for rapid decision-making","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20093989","rel_abs":"Objectives: Given the current pandemic, there is an urgent need to identify effective, safe treatments for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease). A systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted to strengthen the ongoing monitoring of the benefit-risk balance for chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 treatment. Methods: The overall benefit-risk of the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments was assessed using the Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. A value tree was constructed and key benefits and risks were ranked by two clinicians in order of considered importance. Results: Several potential key benefits and risks were identified for use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in COVID-19 treatment. Currently available results did not show an improvement in mortality risk; Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) for death between patients who received HCQ alone vs. neither hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin was 1.08 (95% CI 0.63-1.85). A further study compared the incidence of intubation or death (composite outcome) in a time to event analysis between patients who received HCQ vs. those patients who did not (adjusted Cox proportional HR 1.00 (95% CI 0.76-1.32)). Risk of cardiac arrest, abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) and QT prolongation was greater among patients taking HCQ (with or without azithromycin) compared to standard of care in the same study. Conclusions: Overall, based on the available data there does not appear to be a favourable benefit-risk profile for chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine compared to standard of care in treatment of severe COVID-19. As further data from clinical trials and real world use on these benefits and risks becomes available, this can be incorporated into the framework for an ongoing benefit-risk assessment.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vicki Osborne","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Miranda Davies","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Dhanda","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Debabrata Roy","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Samantha Lane","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Alison Evans","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Saad AW Shakir","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094797","rel_title":"Outcomes among HIV-positive patients hospitalized with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094797","rel_abs":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that some immunocompromised hosts experience worse outcomes. We performed a retrospective matched cohort study to characterize outcomes in HIV-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Leveraging data collected from electronic medical records for all patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19 between March 2, 2020 and April 23, 2020, we matched 21 HIV-positive patients to 42 non-HIV patients using a greedy nearest neighbor algorithm. Admission characteristics, laboratory results, and hospital outcomes were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results: While there was a trend toward increased rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in HIV-positive patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Rates for these outcomes in our cohort are similar to those previously published for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher admission and peak CRP values. Other inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between groups, though HIV-positive patients tended to have higher peak values during their clinical course. Three HIV-positive patients had superimposed bacterial pneumonia with positive sputum cultures, and all three patients expired during hospitalization. There was no difference in frequency of thrombotic events or myocardial infarction between these groups. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that HIV coinfection does not significantly impact presentation, hospital course, or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, when compared to matched non-HIV patients. A larger study is required to determine if the trends we observed apply to all HIV-positive patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Savannah Karmen-Tuohy","author_inst":"New York University Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Philip M.

Consequently, allelic variants of the MHC-I protein have been found to be associated with patient outcome to various viral infections, including SARS-CoV. In the present study, we assess the relationship between observed SARS-CoV-2 population mortality and the predicted viral binding capacities of 52 common MHC-I alleles. Potential SARS-CoV-2 MHC-I peptides were identified using a consensus MHC-I binding and presentation prediction algorithm, called EnsembleMHC. Starting with nearly 3.5 million candidates, we resolved a few hundred high-confidence MHC-I peptides. By weighing individual MHC allele SARS-CoV-2 binding capacity by population frequency in 23 countries, we discover a strong inverse correlation between the predicted population SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding capacity and observed mortality rate. Our computations reveal that peptides derived from the structural proteins of the virus produces a stronger association with observed mortality rate, highlighting the importance of S, N, M, E proteins in driving productive immune responses. These results bring to light how molecular changes in the MHC-I proteins may affect population-level outcomes of viral infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Wilson","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Hirneise","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Singharoy","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Karen S Anderson","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Sizun Jiang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Phillip A Gall","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Chun-Kang Liao","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Liang-Chun Shih","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Christian M Schurch","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David R McIlwain","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pauline Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nicole A Borchard","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David Zarabanda","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sachi S Dholakia","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela Yang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Dayoung Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Tomoharu Kanie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Der Lin","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Hsui Tsai","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Katie M Phillips","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Raymond Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Overdevest","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Tyler","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Carol H Yan","author_inst":"University of California San Diego School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chih-Feng Lin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Tsen Lin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Da-Tian Bau","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Tsay","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zara M Patel","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yung-An Tsou","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chih-Jaan Tai","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Te-Huei Yeh","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Peter H Hwang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Garry P Nolan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayakar V Nayak","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter K Jackson","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095463","rel_title":"Using epidemic simulators for monitoring an ongoing epidemic","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095463","rel_abs":"Prediction of infection trends, estimating the efficacy of contact tracing, testing or impact of influx of infected are of vital importance for administration during an ongoing epidemic. Most effective methods currently are empirical in nature and their relation to parameters of interest to administrators are not evident. We thus propose a modified SEIRD model that is capable of modeling effect of interventions and in migrations on the progress of an epidemic. The tunable parameters of this model bear relevance to monitoring of an epidemic. This model was used to show that some of the commonly seen features of cumulative infections in real data can be explained by piece wise constant changes in interventions and population influx. We also show that the data of cumulative infections from twelve Indian states between mid March and mid April 2020 can be generated from the model by applying interventions according to a set of heuristic rules. Prediction for the next ten days based on this model, reproduced real data very well. In addition, our model also reproduced the time series of recoveries and deaths. Our work constitutes an important first step towards an effective dashboard for the monitoring of epidemic by the administration, especially in an Indian context.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohan Raghavan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Kousik Sarathy Sridharan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Yashaswini M R","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Karen S Anderson","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Sizun Jiang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Phillip A Gall","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Chun-Kang Liao","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Liang-Chun Shih","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Christian M Schurch","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David R McIlwain","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pauline Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nicole A Borchard","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David Zarabanda","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sachi S Dholakia","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela Yang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Dayoung Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Tomoharu Kanie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Der Lin","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Hsui Tsai","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Katie M Phillips","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Raymond Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Overdevest","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Tyler","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Carol H Yan","author_inst":"University of California San Diego School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chih-Feng Lin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Tsen Lin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Da-Tian Bau","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Tsay","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zara M Patel","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yung-An Tsou","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chih-Jaan Tai","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Te-Huei Yeh","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Peter H Hwang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Garry P Nolan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayakar V Nayak","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter K Jackson","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20093229","rel_title":"Placental pathology in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20093229","rel_abs":"Objectives: To describe histopathologic findings in the placentas of women with COVID-19 during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women with COVID-19 delivering between March 18, 2020 and May 5, 2020 were identified. Placentas were examined and compared to historical controls and women with placental evaluation for a history of melanoma. Results: 16 placentas from patients with SARS-CoV-2 were examined (15 with live birth in the 3rd trimester 1 delivered in the 2nd trimester after intrauterine fetal demise). Compared to controls, third trimester placentas were significantly more likely to show at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), including abnormal or injured maternal vessels, as well as delayed villous maturation, chorangiosis, and intervillous thrombi. Rates of acute and chronic inflammation were not increased. The placenta from the patient with intrauterine fetal demise showed villous edema and a retroplacental hematoma. Conclusions: Relative to controls, COVID-19 placentas show increased prevalence of features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), a pattern of placental injury reflecting abnormalities in oxygenation within the intervillous space associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Only 1 COVID-19 patient was hypertensive despite the association of MVM with hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia. These changes may reflect a systemic inflammatory or hypercoagulable state influencing placental physiology.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisheva D Shanes","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Leena B Mithal","author_inst":"Ann and Robert H.

Here, we show that endothelial cells do not express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Instead, pericytes and microvascular smooth muscle cells express ACE2 in an organotypic manner. Pericyte deficiency leads to increased endothelial expression and release of Von Willebrand factor and intravascular platelet and fibrin aggregation, suggesting that pericytes limit endothelial pro-thrombotic responses. That pericytes and not endothelial cells express ACE2 may provide important clues to the pathology of COVID-19, as pericytes are normally shielded behind an endothelial barrier and may get infected only when this barrier is compromised by COVID-19 risk factors.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liqun He","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Maarja Andaloussi Mae","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Lars Muhl","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ying Sun","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Riikka Pietila","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Khayrun Nahar","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Elisa Vazquez Liebanas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Malin Jonsson Fagerlund","author_inst":"Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Anders Oldner","author_inst":"Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Jianping Liu","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Guillem Genove","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Stefanos Liptidis","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Mocci","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Simon Stritt","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Andrey Anisimov","author_inst":"Wihuri Research Institute and Translational Cancer Medicine Program, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Karthik Amudhala Hemanthakumar","author_inst":"Wihuri Research Institute and Translational Cancer Medicine Program, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Markus Rasenen","author_inst":"Wihuri Research Institute and Translational Cancer Medicine Program, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Olivier Mirabeau","author_inst":"Chemin des demoiselles Melson 2, 92160 Antony, France"},{"author_name":"Emil Hansson","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johan Bjorkegren","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, The Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L.

However,  over-sharpening due to the application of a single global B-factor can distort processed maps causing connected densities to appear broken and disconnected. This issue limits the interpretability of cryo-EM maps, i.e. ab initio modelling. In this work, we propose 1) approaches to enhance high-resolution features of cryo-EM maps, while preventing map distortions and 2) methods to obtain local B-factors and electron density occupancy maps. These algorithms have as common link the use of the spiral phase transformation and are called LocSpiral, LocBSharpen, LocBFactor and LocOccupancy. Our results, which include improved maps of recent SARS-CoV-2 structures, show that our methods can improve the interpretability and analysis of obtained reconstructions.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Satinder Kaur","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Josue Gomez-Blanco","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Swathi Adinarayanan","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Khalifa","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ruben Sanchez-Garcia","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wrapp","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jason S McLellan","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Khanh Huy Bui","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Javier Vargas","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Jianping Liu","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Guillem Genove","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Stefanos Liptidis","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Mocci","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Simon Stritt","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Andrey Anisimov","author_inst":"Wihuri Research Institute and Translational Cancer Medicine Program, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Karthik Amudhala Hemanthakumar","author_inst":"Wihuri Research Institute and Translational Cancer Medicine Program, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Markus Rasenen","author_inst":"Wihuri Research Institute and Translational Cancer Medicine Program, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Olivier Mirabeau","author_inst":"Chemin des demoiselles Melson 2, 92160 Antony, France"},{"author_name":"Emil Hansson","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johan Bjorkegren","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, The Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L.

The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low M affinities. In contrast, we found that only the MERS-CoV Mac1 protein bound to poly-ADP-ribose (PAR), and none of these enzymes could hydrolyze PAR. Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting antibodies and both gel-based assay and novel ELISA assays, we demonstrated highly efficient de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are highly efficient MAR-hydrolases with strikingly similar activity, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused nearly 350 thousand deaths worldwide. With, no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic post-translational process increasingly recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins. These results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this unique protein domain.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yousef M.O.
