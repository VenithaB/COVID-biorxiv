Aim To examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries. Design Cross-sectional telephone survey, carried out in March 2020. Setting Sixteen Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 risk into high (more than 25 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), medium (15-25 cases per 100,000), and low risk (fewer than 15 cases per 100,000) regions. A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. Results Seven high risk, five medium risk and four low risk hospices provided data. Two high risk hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff. All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria, and daily telephone support for families. Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute setting. Conclusion The hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response. Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Massimo Costantini","author_inst":"Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Katherine E Sleeman","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carlo Peruselli","author_inst":"SICP-Italian Society of Palliative Care"},{"author_name":"Irene J Higginson","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"palliative medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037515","rel_title":"A Tool to Early Predict Severe 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) : A Multicenter Study using the Risk Nomogram in Wuhan and Guangdong, China","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037515","rel_abs":"Background Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly develop acute respiratory distress leading to respiratory failure, with high short-term mortality rates. At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Methods SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from one center in Wuhan city and two centers in Guangzhou city, China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. Findings The train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19 and 107 (28.76%) patients had one of the following basic disease, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978]) in the train cohort with a sensitivity of 85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% ; 0.853 [0.790-0.916] in validation cohort with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4%. The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. DCA and CICA further indicated that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit. Interpretation Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19. And this risk stratification tool will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients, and optimal use of medical resources via patient prioritization and thus significantly reduce mortality rates. The RDW plays an important role in predicting severe COVID-19, implying that the role of RBC in severe disease is underestimated.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiao Gong","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingyi Ou","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xueping Qiu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yusheng Jie","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yaqiong Chen","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Lianxiong Yuan","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Cao","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Mingkai Tan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenxiong Xu","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fang Zheng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yaling Shi","author_inst":"Clinical Laboratory of Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Hu","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038638","rel_title":"Spatial Visualization of Cluster-Specific COVID-19 Transmission Network in South Korea During the Early Epidemic Phase","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038638","rel_abs":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading throughout China and other countries including South Korea. As of March 12, 2020, a total number of 7,869 cases and 66 deaths had been documented in South Korea. Although the first confirmed case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases showed a rapid growth on February 19, 2020 with a total number of 1,261 cases with 12 deaths based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Method Using the data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea that are publicly available from the KCDC, this paper aims to create spatial visualizations of COVID-19 transmission between January 20, 2020 and February 19, 2020. Results Using spatial visualization, this paper identified two early transmission clusters in South Korea (Daegu cluster and capital area cluster). Using a degree-weighted centrality measure, this paper proposes potential super-spreaders of the virus in the visualized clusters. Conclusion Compared to various epidemiological measures such as the basic reproduction number, spatial visualizations of the cluster-specific transmission networks and the proposed centrality measure may be more useful to characterize super-spreaders and the spread of the virus especially in the early epidemic phase.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James Yeongjun Park","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Methods: We combine data from four countries to produce pooled age-banded Case Fatality Rates (CFRs), calculate the sex-difference in survival and use data from four recent studies to convert CFRs into age-sex stratified Infection Fatality Rates (IFRs). We estimate the additional risk of death in cancer patients, and in those receiving chemotherapy. We illustrate the impact of these by considering the impact on a national incident cancer cohort and present some clinical scenarios. Results: We obtained data based on 412,985 cases and 41,854 deaths. The pooled estimate for IFR was 0.92%. Age-related IFRs for patients with cancer range from 0.01% to 29%, and higher in patients receiving chemotherapy. The risk is significantly higher in men than women. 40% of all male and 32% of all female patients with a new diagnosis of cancer this year have an IFR of >= 5\\%. Conclusions: Older male patients are at a higher risk of death with COVID infection. Patients with cancer are also at higher risk, as are those who have recently received chemotherapy. We provide well-founded estimates to allow patients and clinicians to better balance these risks, and illustrate the wider impact in a national incident cohort.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matt Williams","author_inst":"Computational Oncology Group, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ella Mi","author_inst":"Department of Radiotherapy, Imperial College Healthcare Trust"},{"author_name":"Kerlann Le Calvez","author_inst":"Computational Oncology Group, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jiarong Chen","author_inst":"Computational Oncology Group, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lillie Pakzad-Shahabi","author_inst":"John Fulcher Neuro-oncology Lab, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Seema Dadhania","author_inst":"Computational Oncology Group, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrew LK Ho","author_inst":"Addenbrooke Hospital Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Simon Rabinowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Fang Zheng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yaling Shi","author_inst":"Clinical Laboratory of Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Hu","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038026","rel_title":"Chinese Public Attention to COVID-19 Epidemic: Based on Social Media","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038026","rel_abs":"Background: Since the new coronavirus epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. Results: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage are slightly different. In addition, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics has changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Finally, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: (1) new COVID-19 epidemics and their impact; (2) frontline reporting of the epidemic and prevention and control measures; (3) expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection; (4) medical services on the frontline of the epidemic; and (5) focus on the global epidemic and the search for suspected cases. Conclusions: This is the first study of public attention on the COVID-19 epidemic using a Chinese social media platform (i.e., Sina Microblog). Our study found that social media (e.g., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention to public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.

Rapid and precise diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19, providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled with nanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfully established for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment (such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63 C) for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame 1a\/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified and detected in a one-step and single-tube reaction, and the detection results were easily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients, the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33\/33) in the oropharynx swab samples, and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96\/96) when analyzed the clinical samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients. The total diagnosis test from sample collection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h. In sum, the RT-LAMP-NBS is a promising tool for diagnosing the current SARS-CoV-2 infection in first line field, public health and clinical laboratories, especially for resource-challenged regions.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiong Zhu","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxia Wang","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Limei Han","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Ting Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Licheng Wang","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Huan Li","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Sha Li","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Lvfen He","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Fu","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Shaojin Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xing Mei","author_inst":"Wenchang Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Hai Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Yi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Childrens Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Childrens Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037689","rel_title":"Tracing DAY-ZERO and Forecasting the Fade out of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A Compartmental Modelling and Numerical Optimization Approach.","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037689","rel_abs":"Italy became the second epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after China, surpassing by far China's death toll. The disease swept through Lombardy, which remained in lockdown for about two months, starting from the 8th of March. As of that day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy were extended to the entire country. Here, assuming that effectively there was one case ``zero\" that introduced the virus to the region, we provide estimates for: (a) the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population until March 8; (c) the basic reproduction number Ro based on the estimation of the actual number of infected cases. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model and approach, we also provide a tentative forecast two months ahead of time, i.e. until May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. Methods. To deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual asymptomatic infected cases in the total population, we address a modified compartmental Susceptible\/ Exposed\/ Infectious Asymptomatic\/ Infected Symptomatic\/ Recovered\/ Dead (SEIIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the \"effective\" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem. Based on the computed parameters, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number $R_0$. To examine the efficiency of the model and approach, we ran the simulator to forecast the epidemic two months ahead of time, i.e. from March 8 to May 4. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and the effects of social distancing and of the draconian measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. Results. Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the expected DAY-ZERO was January 14 (min-max rage: January 5 to January 23, interquartile range: January 11 to January 18). The actual cumulative number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases, while the expected value of the basic reproduction number Ro was found to be 4.53 (min-max range: 4.40- 4.65). The model approximated adequately two months ahead of time the evolution of reported cases until May 4, the day on which the phase I of the relaxation of measures was implemented over all of Italy.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia Russo","author_inst":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche"},{"author_name":"Cleo Anastassopoulou","author_inst":"Medical School of Athens, University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Athanassios Tsakris","author_inst":"Medical School, University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Gennaro Nicola Bifulco","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II"},{"author_name":"Emilio Fortunato Campana","author_inst":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Toraldo","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II"},{"author_name":"Constantinos Siettos","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Lvfen He","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Fu","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Shaojin Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xing Mei","author_inst":"Wenchang Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Hai Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Yi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Childrens Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Childrens Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038190","rel_title":"A brief review of antiviral drugs evaluated in registered clinical trials for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038190","rel_abs":"Background: Although a number of antiviral agents have been evaluated for coronaviruses there are no approved drugs available. To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials. Methods: A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms \"2019-nCoV\", \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"Hcov-19\", \"new coronavirus\", \"novel coronavirus\". We included interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs or agents. Findings: Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the trials were randomized with parallel assignment and the median number of planned inclusions was 63 (IQR, 36-120). Open-label studies were the most frequent (46%) followed by double-blind (13%) and single blind studies (10%). The most frequently assessed therapies were: stem cells therapy (n=23 trials), lopinavir\/ritonavir (n=15), chloroquine (n=11), umifenovir (n=9), hydroxychloroquine (n=7), plasma treatment (n=7), favipiravir (n=7), methylprednisolone (n=5), and remdesivir (n=5). Remdesivir was tested in 5 trials with a median of 400 (IQR, 394-453) planned inclusions per trial, while stem cells therapy was tested in 23 trials, but had a median of 40 (IQR, 23-60) planned inclusions per trial.

Conclusion: Canceling elective outpatient surgeries during the COVID19 pandemic could prevent a large number of patient and healthcare worker infections.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuemei Zhang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Sheng-Ru Cheng","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lescure","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM"},{"author_name":"France Mentr\u00e9","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Laou\u00e9nan","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM"},{"author_name":"Constantinos Siettos","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Lvfen He","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Fu","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Shaojin Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xing Mei","author_inst":"Wenchang Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Hai Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Yi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Childrens Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Childrens Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.16.20037135","rel_title":"Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: preliminary results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.16.20037135","rel_abs":"Background Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on COV-19, and reported to be efficient in Chinese patients infected by this virus.

We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Researchers from the U.S, Spain, and Italy have adopted our approach and we are collaborating to further improve it.

Although the clinical features of COVID-19 have been reported previously, data regarding the risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes are lacking. Objectives: To summary and analyze the clinical characteristics and identify the predictors of disease severity and mortality. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Cochrane and MedRxiv databases were searched through February 25, 2020. Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations were followed. We extracted and pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis to summary the clinical feature of the confirmed COVID-19 patients, and further identify risk factors for disease severity and death. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method and explained with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: A total of 30 studies including 53000 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study, the mean age was 49.8 years (95% CI, 47.5-52.2 yrs) and 55.5% were male. The pooled incidence of severity and mortality were 20.2% (95% CI, 15.1-25.2%) and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.9-4.2%), respectively. The predictor for disease severity included old age ([&ge;] 50 yrs, odds ratio [OR] = 2.61; 95% CI, 2.29-2.98), male (OR =1.348, 95% CI, 1.195-1.521), smoking (OR =1.734, 95% CI, 1.146-2.626) and any comorbidity (OR = 2.635, 95% CI, 2.098-3.309), especially chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR = 6.017; 95% CI, 2.192-16.514), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, OR = 5.323; 95% CI, 2.613-10.847) and cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.219; 95% CI, 1.486-6.972). In terms of laboratory results, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer and decreased blood platelet and lymphocytes count were highly associated with severe COVID-19 (all for P < 0.001). Meanwhile, old age ([&ge;] 60 yrs, RR = 9.45; 95% CI, 8.09-11.04), followed by cardiovascular disease (RR = 6.75; 95% CI, 5.40-8.43) hypertension (RR = 4.48; 95% CI, 3.69-5.45) and diabetes (RR = 4.43; 95% CI, 3.49-5.61) were found to be independent prognostic factors for the COVID-19 related death.

Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis and modeling. We used the daily reports of definitive COVID-19 patients (sampling of severe cases and hospitalization) released by Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Epidemic projection models of Gompertz, Von Bertalanffy and least squared error (LSE) were used to predict the number of cases at April 3, 2020 until May 13, 2020. Results: R0 in Iran was estimated to be 4.7 that has now fallen to below 2. Given the three different scenarios, the prediction of the patients on April 3, 2020 by Von Bertalanffy, Gompertz and LSE were estimated at 48200, 52500 and 58000, respectively. The number of deceased COVID-19 patients was also estimated to be 3600 individuals using the Von growth model, 4200 ones by Gompertz's model and 4850 ones according to the LSE method. To predict and estimate the number of patients and deaths in the end of epidemic based on Von and Gompertz models, we will have 87000 cases, 4900 and 11000 deaths until 13 May and 1 June, respectively. Conclusion: The process of controlling the epidemic is tangible. If enforcement and public behavior interventions continue with current trends, the control and reduction of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran will be flat from April 28, until July, 2020 and new cases are expected to decline from the following Iranian new year.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Ph.D of Applied Mathematics, Researcher at Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran"},{"author_name":"Majid Shirani","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."},{"author_name":"Fereydoon Rahmani","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, School of Medicine, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."},{"author_name":"Jiawei Gu","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Pan Hou","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhifu Guo","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Herve TISSOT DUPONT","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Stephane HONORE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Philippe COLSON","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Eric CHABRIERE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard LA SCOLA","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Jean Marc ROLAIN","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe BROUQUI","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT Sr.","author_inst":"IHU Mediterrane Infection, Aix Marseille University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038117","rel_title":"Predicting the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in China and across the world using the machine learning approach","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038117","rel_abs":"Background: Although COVID-19 has been well controlled in China, it is rapidly spreading outside the country and may have catastrophic results globally without implementation of necessary mitigation measures. Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most have used early-stage data and focused on Chinese cases. Methods: We first built models to predict daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China based on data from January 20, 2020, to March 1, 2020. Based on these models, we built models to predict the epidemic trend across the world (outside China). We also built models to predict the epidemic trend in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading. Findings: The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked on February 22, 2020, in China and will peak on May 22, 2020, across the world. It will be basically under control in early April 2020 in China and end-August 2020 across the world. The total number of COVID-19 cases will reach around 89,000 in China and 6,126,000 across the world during the epidemic. Around 4,000 and 290,000 people will die of COVID-19 in China and across the world, respectively. The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked recently in Italy and will peak in Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA within two weeks. Interpretation: The COVID-19 outbreak is controllable in the foreseeable future if comprehensive and stringent control measures are taken.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mengyuan Li","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Zhilan Zhang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Shanmei Jiang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Qian Liu","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Canping Chen","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Pinghu hospital of Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaosheng Wang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Herve TISSOT DUPONT","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Stephane HONORE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Philippe COLSON","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Eric CHABRIERE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard LA SCOLA","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Jean Marc ROLAIN","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe BROUQUI","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT Sr.","author_inst":"IHU Mediterrane Infection, Aix Marseille University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037648","rel_title":"Sentinel Event Surveillance to Estimate Total SARS-CoV-2 Infections, United States","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037648","rel_abs":"Human infections with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were first identified via syndromic surveillance in December of 2019 in Wuhan China. Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 180,000 confirmed cases as of March 16, 2020. Effective public health interventions, including social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation\/quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases. However, testing capacity (having sufficient tests and laboratory throughput) to support these non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a challenge for containment and mitigation of COVID-19 infections. We undertook a sentinel event strategy (where single health events signal emerging trends) to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in the US. Data from a recent national conference, the Conservative Political Action Conference, (CPAC) near Washington, DC and from the outbreak in Wuhan, China were used to fit a simple exponential growth model to estimate the total number of incident SARS- CoV-2 infections in the United States on March 1, 2020, and to forecast subsequent infections potentially undetected by current testing strategies. Our analysis and forecasting estimates a total of 54,100 SARS-CoV-2 infections (80 % CI 5,600 to 125,300) have occurred in the United States to March 12, 2020.

Asymptomatic carriers of the COVID-19 virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild disease, are a major contributor in the propagation of the disease. The rapid spread of COVID-19 forced governments around the world to establish and enforce generalized risk mitigation strategies, from lockdowns to guidelines for social distancing, in an effort to minimize community transmission. This created an unprecedented epidemiological situation not properly characterized by existing mathematical models of isolation and quarantine. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model for community transmission of COVID-19 taking into account asymptomatic carriers and varying degrees of risk mitigation. The main results consist of an exact calculation of the effective reproduction number R_e(t), and a modeling framework that enables the quantification of the effect of risk mitigation and asymptomatism on community transmission.

Therefore, with the primary aim of identifying best practice and scrutinizing its supporting evidence, we conducted a systematic review of literature for articles published between 1 January 2002 and 15 March 2020 in five databases relating to both the current SARS-CoV2 and the previous SARS-CoV outbreaks. Official websites for gastroenterology and endoscopy societies in the 15 most affected countries were also searched. Unfortunately, a paucity of high quality data and heterogeneity of recommendations between countries was observed. Interestingly, not all countries advocated the postponement of non-urgent or elective procedures. Recommendations for patient screening and personal protective equipment were commonly featured in all recommendations but specifics varied. Only 32% (9\/28) of all gastroenterology and endoscopy societies issued guidance on endoscopy in the COVID-19 pandemic.

This newly propose model well describes an epidemic growth and it could be widely applied into various topics including pathology, epidemiology, business and data sciences. The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model (AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system. This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available. The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the AAEDM are also introduced in this paper. The evaluation of this theoretical model based on the Covid-19 data in Korea has been accomplished with relative fair future prediction accuracies. Although this analytical model has been designed from a basic exponential growth model, the performance of the AAEDM is competitive with other Bigdata based simulation models. Since the AAEDM is relatively simple and handy, anyone can use this model into analyzing outbreak situations in his daily life.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Song-Kyoo Kim","author_inst":"Macao Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Gail B.

There is great attention for the diffusion and evolution of the CoVid-19 infection which started from the north (particularly in the Lombardia region) and it is now rapidly affecting other Italian regions. We investigate on the impact of patients hospitalisation in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at a regional and subregional granularity. We propose a model derived from well-known models in epidemic to estimate the needed number of places in intensive care units. The model will help decision-makers to plan resources in the short and medium-term in order to guarantee appropriate treatments to all patients needing it. We analyse Italian data at regional level up to March 15th aiming to: (i) support health and government decision-makers in gathering rapid and efficient decisions on increasing health structures capacities (in terms of ICU slots) and (ii) define a scalable geographic model to plan emergency and future CoVid-19 patients management using reallocating them among health structures. Finally, the here proposed model can be useful in countries where CoVid-19 is not yet strongly diffused.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pietro Hiram Guzzi","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Tradigo","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Pierangelo Veltri","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Juan B.

The large droplet route has been commonly believed to be dominant for most respiratory infections since the early 20th century, and the associated droplet precaution is widely known and practiced in hospitals and in the community. The mechanism of exposure to droplets expired at close contact, however, remains surprisingly unexplored. In this study, the exposure to exhaled droplets during close contact (< 2 m) via both the short-range airborne and large droplet sub-routes is studied using a simple mathematical model of expired flows and droplet dispersion\/deposition\/inhalation, which enables the calculation of exposure due to both deposition and inhalation. The short-range airborne route is found to dominate at most distances studied during both talking and coughing. The large droplet route only dominates when the droplets are larger than 100 m and when the subjects are within 0.2 m while talking or 0.5 m while coughing. The smaller the exhaled droplets, the more important the short-range airborne route. The large droplet route contributes less than 10% of exposure when the droplets are smaller than 50 m and when the subjects are more than 0.3 m apart, even while coughing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenzhao Chen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Nan Zhang","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jianjian Wei","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling YEN","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Pinghu hospital of Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaosheng Wang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Herve TISSOT DUPONT","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Stephane HONORE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Philippe COLSON","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Eric CHABRIERE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard LA SCOLA","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Jean Marc ROLAIN","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe BROUQUI","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT Sr.","author_inst":"IHU Mediterrane Infection, Aix Marseille University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037903","rel_title":"Double-Quencher Probes Improved the Detection Sensitivity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by One-Step RT-PCR","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037903","rel_abs":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerges in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, spreads worldwide, and threats the human life.

Methods: This study utilized primers and single-quencher probes in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. Moreover, we designed the double-quencher probes (YCH assay) according to the oligonucleotide sequence established by NIID. Using these assays, we conducted a one-step real-time RT-PCR with serial DNA positive control to assess the detection sensitivity. Results: The threshold cycle (Ct) value of RT-PCR was relatively low in CDC and YCH assays compared to NIID assay. Serial dilution assay showed that both CDC and YCH assays could detect a low-copy number of DNA positive control. The background fluorescent signal at the baseline was lower in YCH than that of NIID. Conclusion: Double-quencher probes decreased background fluorescent signal and improved detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yosuke Hirotsu","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Mochizuki","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Masao Omata","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling YEN","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Pinghu hospital of Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaosheng Wang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Herve TISSOT DUPONT","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Stephane HONORE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Philippe COLSON","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Eric CHABRIERE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard LA SCOLA","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Jean Marc ROLAIN","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe BROUQUI","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT Sr.","author_inst":"IHU Mediterrane Infection, Aix Marseille University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038059","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038059","rel_abs":"A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic.

Validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir and epidemiological studies. Here, we developed serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike- and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed infections of SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific in-house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the two, with IgA showing higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays described here can be instrumental for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"NISREEN M.A. OKBA","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Muller","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Wentao Li","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Chunyan Wang","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Corine H.

Methods A multi-center cross-section study (285 patients) and a single-center follow-up study (63 patients) were performed to investigate the feature of acute antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. A cohort of 52 COVID-19 suspects and 64 close contacts were enrolled to evaluate the potentiality of the antibody test. Results The positive rate for IgG reached 100% around 20 days after symptoms onset. The median day of serocon-version for both lgG and IgM was 13 days after symptoms onset. Seroconversion of IgM occurred at the same time, or earlier, or later than that of IgG. IgG levels in 100% patients (19\/19) entered a platform within 6 days after seroconversion. The criteria of IgG seroconversion and [&ge;] 4-fold increase in the IgG titers in sequential samples together diagnosed 82.9% (34\/41) of the patients. Antibody test aided to confirm 4 patients with COVID-19 from 52 suspects who failed to be confirmed by RT-PCR and 7 patients from 148 close contacts with negative RT-PCR. Conclusion IgM and IgG should be detected simultaneously at the early phase of infection. The serological diagnosis criterion of seroconversion or [&ge;] 4-fold increase in the IgG titer is suitable for a majority of COVID-19 patients. Serologic test is helpful for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspects and close contacts.","rel_num_authors":47,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quan-xin Long","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of

Methods We conducted a prospective case-ascertained study on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and their contacts. Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) was analyzed for different exposure windows after symptom onset of index cases and for different exposure settings. Results Thirty-two confirmed patients were enrolled and 12 paired data (index-secondary cases) were identified among the 1,043 contacts. The secondary clinical attack rate was 0.9% (95% CI 0.5-1.7%). The attack rate was higher among those whose exposure to index cases started within five days of symptom onset (2.4%, 95% CI 1.1-4.5%) than those who were exposed later (zero case from 605 close contacts, 95% CI 0-0.61%). The attack rate was also higher among household contacts (13.6%, 95% CI 4.7-29.5%) and non-household family contacts (8.5%, 95% CI 2.4-20.3%) than that in healthcare or other settings. The higher secondary clinical attack rate for contacts near symptom onset remained when the analysis was restricted to household and family contacts. There was a trend of increasing attack rate with the age of contacts (p for trend < 0.001). Conclusions High transmissibility of COVID-19 near symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized social distancing measures are required. Rapid reduction of transmissibility over time implies that prolonged hospitalization of mild cases might not be necessary in large epidemics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hao-Yuan Cheng","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Shu-Wan Jian","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for

Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach. METHODSWe established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents. RESULTS: The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT-dPCR assays were ~1.6, ~1.6 and ~0.8 copies\/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies\/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients. CONCLUSION: RT-dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR was more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lianhua Dong","author_inst":"National institute of metrology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Chunyan Niu","author_inst":"National institute of metrology, China"},{"author_name":"Quanyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yang Pan","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Sitong Sheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xia Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yongzhuo Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiayi Yang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Manqing Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Tao Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Peng","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xie","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yunhua Gao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Di Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"School of Life Science, Chongqing University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Dai","author_inst":"National institute of metrology China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Fang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiang-lin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

In order to overcome the current data shortcoming, this paper proposes a bootstrap driven, estimation procedure for the number of people infected with the SARSCoV2. This method is designed to be robust, automatic and suitable to generate estimations at regional level. Obtained results show that, while official data at March the 12th report 12.839 cases in Italy, people infected wiyh the SARSCoV2 could be as high as 105.789.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Livio Fenga","author_inst":"ISTAT"},{"author_name":"Junbo Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Chunyan Niu","author_inst":"National institute of metrology, China"},{"author_name":"Quanyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yang Pan","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Sitong Sheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xia Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yongzhuo Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiayi Yang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Manqing Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Tao Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Peng","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xie","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yunhua Gao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Di Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"School of Life Science, Chongqing University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Dai","author_inst":"National institute of metrology China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Fang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiang-lin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

This study aims to explore the association between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) death and weather parameters. Methods In this study, we collected the daily death number of COVID-19, meteorological and air pollutant data from 20 January, 2020 to 29 February, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Then, the generalized additive model was applied to explore the impact of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on daily mortality of COVID-19. Results There were in total 2299 COVID-19 mortality counts in Wuhan. A positive association with COVID-19 mortality was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = -0.32). In addition, each 1 unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 mortality at lag 3. However, both per 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 mortality at lag 3 and lag 5, respectively.

Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer Beam Dowd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Valentina Rotondi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Liliana Andriano","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David M Brazel","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Per Block","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Xuejie Ding","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yan Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Melinda C Mills","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bin Luo","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Manqing Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Tao Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Peng","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xie","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yunhua Gao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Di Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"School of Life Science, Chongqing University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Dai","author_inst":"National institute of metrology China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Fang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiang-lin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

In this study, we examined Rt of COVID-19 and compared its transmissibility between different intervention periods in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Methods: Daily aggregated counts of confirmed imported and local cases between January 1, 2020 and March 13, 2020 were analysed. A likelihood function was constructed to estimate Rt, accounting for imported cases. Results: Although Hangzhou had fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Shenzhen had higher proportion of imported cases than Hangzhou (83% vs 29%). Since the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, Rt was kept below unity through time. On the contrary, Rt was greater than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to 7 February due to the surge in local cases. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures following the local lockdown, Rt decreased steadily and dropped below unity in mid-February. Conclusion: The lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Meanwhile, cities with similar epidemic trend could have different transmission dynamics given the variation in imported cases.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ka Chun Chong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Cheng","author_inst":"Zhejiang Province Centre for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shi Zhao","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Feng Ling","author_inst":"Zhejiang Province Centre for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kirran Mohammad","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Maggie Wang","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Benny Zee","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lei Wei","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xi Xiong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hengyan Liu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jingxuan Wang","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Enfu Chen","author_inst":"Zhejiang Province Centre for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Peng","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xie","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yunhua Gao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Di Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"School of Life Science, Chongqing University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Dai","author_inst":"National institute of metrology China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Fang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiang-lin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.
