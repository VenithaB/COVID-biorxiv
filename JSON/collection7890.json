Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (> 90%) and positive predictive value (69 - 84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination. We conclude that CT is an expedite and reliable diagnostic tool to support first line triage of suspect COVID-19 patients in areas where the diffusion of the virus is widespread.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio Esposito","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Palmisano","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Giulia Maria Scotti","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Marco Jacopo Morelli","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Davide Vignale","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Francesco De Cobelli","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Tonon","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tacchetti","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20047860","rel_title":"Global versus focused isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-A cost-effectiveness analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20047860","rel_abs":"Objectives: While highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread, national lockdowns come with an enormous economic price. Few countries have adopted an alternative \"testing, tracing, and isolation\" approach to selectively isolate people at high exposure risk, thereby minimizing the economic impact. To assist policymakers, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of these two strategies. Methods: A modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered and Deceased (SEIRD) model was employed to assess the situation in Israel, a small country with ~9 million people. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of these strategies, as well as the expected number of infected individuals and deaths were calculated. Results: A nationwide lockdown is expected to save on average 274 (median 124, interquartile range (IQR): 71-221) lives compared to the \"testing, tracing, and isolation\" approach. However, the ICER will be on average $45,104,156 (median $ 49.6 million, IQR: 22.7-220.1) to prevent one case of death. Conclusions: A national lockdown has a moderate advantage in saving lives with tremendous costs and possible overwhelming economic effects. These findings should assist decision-makers in dealing with additional waves of this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amir Shlomai","author_inst":"Department of Medicine D and The Liver Institute, Rabin Medical Center,  Beilinson Hospital, Petah-Tikva, Israel and The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv U"},{"author_name":"Ari Leshno","author_inst":"Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel and The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."},{"author_name":"Ella H Sklan","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Moshe Leshno","author_inst":"The Coller School of Management, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Davide Vignale","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Francesco De Cobelli","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Tonon","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tacchetti","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20047456","rel_title":"Classification of COVID-19 in chest X-ray images using DeTraC deep convolutional neural network","rel_date":"2020-04-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20047456","rel_abs":"Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adapt our previously developed CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC), for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability of DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset collected from several hospitals around the world. High accuracy of 95.12% (with a sensitivity of 97.91%, a specificity of 91.87%, and a precision of 93.36%) was achieved by DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 X-ray images from normal, and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asmaa Abbas","author_inst":"Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Abdelsamea","author_inst":"Birmingham City University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Gaber","author_inst":"Birmingham City University"},{"author_name":"Moshe Leshno","author_inst":"The Coller School of Management, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Davide Vignale","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Francesco De Cobelli","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Tonon","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tacchetti","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20046243","rel_title":"The COVID-19 infection in Italy: a statistical study of an abnormally severe disease","rel_date":"2020-04-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20046243","rel_abs":"We statistically investigate the Coronavirus Disease 19 (hereinafter Covid-19) epidemics, which is particularly invasive in Italy.

To give a more realistic estimate of the mortality of Covid-19, we use the most recent estimates of the IFR (Infection Fatality Ratio) of epidemic, based on the minimum observed CFR, and furthermore analyse data obtained from the ship Diamond Princess, a good representation of a laboratory case-study from an isolated system in which all the people have been tested. From such analyses we derive more realistic estimates of the real extension of the infection, as well as more accurate indicators of how fast the infection propagates. We then point out from the various explanations proposed, the dominant factors causing such an abnormal seriousness of the disease in Italy.

In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experience shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators in early April, the most critical situation observed for ICU beds. Increasing the allocation of beds for COVID-19 (in lieu of other conditions) or temporarily placing all resources under the administration of the state delays the anticipated start of shortages by a week. This suggests that solutions adopted by the Brazilian government must aim at expanding the available capacity (e.g., makeshift hospitals), and not simply prioritizing the allocation of available resources to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcia C Castro","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

The number of travelers alone does not explain risk; passenger origin and destination will also influence risk of disease introduction and spread. We described trends in international air passenger numbers and connectivity between countries with different capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease threats. Methods: We used the Fragile States Index (FSI) as an annual measure of country-level resilience and capacity to respond to infectious disease events. Countries are categorized as: Sustainable, Stable, Warning, or Alert, in order of increasing fragility. We included data for 177 sovereign states for the years 2007 to 2016. Annual inbound and outbound international air passengers for each country were obtained for the same time period. We examined trends in FSI score, trends in worldwide air travel, and the association between a state's FSI score and air travel. Results: Among countries included in the FSI rankings, the total number of passengers increased from 0.791 billion to 1.28 billion between 2007 and 2016. Increasing fragility was associated with a decrease in travel volumes, with a 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3-3.5%) reduction in passengers per 1-unit increase in FSI score. Overall, travel between countries of different FSI categories either increased or remained stable. The greatest increase was observed for travel to Warning countries from Warning countries, with an annual increase of 8,967,623 passengers (95%CI: 6,546,494 to 11,388,753) over the study period. Conclusions: The world's connectivity via air travel has increased dramatically over the past decade. There has been notable growth in travel from Warning and Stable countries, which comprise more than three-quarters of international air travel passengers. These countries may have suboptimal capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease threats that emerge within their borders.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashleigh R Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Deepit Bhatia","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Rahim Moineddin","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Alexander G Watts","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Kamran Khan","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Wanderson Kleber de Oliveira","author_inst":"Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Brazilian Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccolo","author_inst":"CoronaVerus, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Scala","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Napoli \"Federico II\", Dept.

On 26 March 2020, a total of 17166 cases were already reported, with 2090 deaths. Globally a R0 index of 2-3 has been reported. We aimed to build an experimental mathematical model that help to analyze the early characteristics of Madrid Covid-19 disese outbreak and to explore the actual R0 index on Madrid Covid-19 outbreak. Material and Methods: A simulated mathematical model was built, based on a SIR epidemiological model and the reported characteristics of Wuhan Covid-19 disease outbreak. Monte Carlo simulations were further done to estimate the R0 value over time in the Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak. Results: Mean estimated R0 value along the early period is of 2.22 (+\/- 1.21 SD). A significant increase of 0.093 (+\/- 0.037, p=0.025) in R0 value each day of outbreak is found. Conclussions: Our proposed Mathematical Simulation model may be useful to evaluate early characteristics of this outbreak. The present work is the first reported estimation of R0 value in the Spanish Madrid Covid-19 outbreak, with similar results to the previous reported in the Wuhan outbreak, although it may suggest a slightly increase on R0 along time.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Garcia-Iglesias","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Francisco Javier de Cos Juez","author_inst":"Universidad de Oviedo"},{"author_name":"Rahim Moineddin","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Alexander G Watts","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Kamran Khan","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Wanderson Kleber de Oliveira","author_inst":"Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Brazilian Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccolo","author_inst":"CoronaVerus, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Scala","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Napoli \"Federico II\", Dept.

In such cases, conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak to more effectively mitigate the spread of the disease. Using a simple epidemiological model we show that, however, there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire further investigations within the context of more complex and data-driven epidemiological models, and can ultimately help decision makers to improve temporal social distancing policies to mitigate the spread of epidemics.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oscar Patterson-Lomba","author_inst":"Analysis Group"},{"author_name":"Francisco Javier de Cos Juez","author_inst":"Universidad de Oviedo"},{"author_name":"Rahim Moineddin","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Alexander G Watts","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Kamran Khan","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Wanderson Kleber de Oliveira","author_inst":"Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Brazilian Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccolo","author_inst":"CoronaVerus, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Scala","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Napoli \"Federico II\", Dept.

The EnerPol platform has been used in a broad range of case studies in different sectors in all of Europe, USA, Japan, South Korea and sub Saharan Africa over the last 10 years. In the present study, the entire Swiss population (8.57 million people), including cross-border commuters, and the entire Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics. The predictions estimate that between 22 February and 11 April 2020, there will be 720 deaths from 83300 COVID-19 cases, and 73300 will have recovered; our preliminary variability in these estimates is about 21% over the aforementioned period. In the absence of governmental intervention, 42.7% of the Swiss population would have been infected by 25 April 2020 compared to our prediction of a 1% infection over this time period, saving thousands of lives. It is argued that future scenarios regarding relaxation of the lockdown should be carefully simulated, as by 19 April 2020, there will still remain a substantial number of infected individuals, who could retrigger a second spread of COVID-19. Through the use of a digital tool, such as Enerpol, to evaluate in a data-driven manner the impacts of various policy scenarios, the most effective measures to mitigate a spread of COVID-19 can be devised while we await the deployment of large-scale vaccination for the population globally. By tailoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of the spread to match the capacity of local healthcare facilities, appropriate logistic needs can be determined, in order not to overwhelm the health care services across the country.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reza S.

However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to be used as assay standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation.

We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 virus copies per reaction, except for the RdRp-SARSr (Charite) confirmatory primer-probe set which has low sensitivity.

This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks. Methods: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. Results: We identified three major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social media related to the recent special law on combating COVID-2019. Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease with a massive mitigation program. From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. Twitter reflected the clear, structural division of the Polish political sphere. We were able to identify potential sources of misinformation as well as key actors (especially early adopters) and influencers. Conclusions: Traditional and social media not only reflect reality, but also create it. Polish authorities, having a reliable analysis of the perception of the problem, could optimally prepare and manage the social dimension of the current epidemic and future ones. Due to filter bubbles observed on Twitter, public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected. For greater penetration, it might be necessary to diversify information channels to reach as many people as possible which might already be happening. Moreover, it might be necessary to prevent the spread of disinformation, which is now possible due to the special law on combating COVID-2019.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrzej Jarynowski","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Research"},{"author_name":"Monika Wojta-Kempa","author_inst":"Affiliation: Department of Public Health, Faculty of Health Science, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland"},{"author_name":"Vitaly Belik","author_inst":"Affiliation: System Modeling Group, Institute of Veterinary Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Freie Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Joseph R Fauver","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Isabel M.

Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-time lockdown is one where the midpoint of the lockdown period coincides with the actual peak of the spread of the disease in the absence of the lockdown. We further show that the true effectivity of imposing a lockdown may be misrepresented and grossly underestimated by the reported case trajectories in the days following the action.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B Shayak","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Mohit Manoj Sharma","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard H Rand","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Awadhesh Kumar Singh","author_inst":"GD Hospital and Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"Anoop Misra","author_inst":"Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaney C.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel epidemic model called SEIR-HC, which is a novel epidemic model with two different social circles.

Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk perception. We find that the 2019-2020 ILI season is smaller and decreases earlier than expected based on prior influenza seasons, and that the increase in COVID-19 risk perception is associated with this decrease. Additionally, we find that a 5% average reduction in transmission is sufficient to reproduce the observed flu dynamics. We propose that precautionary behaviors driven by COVID-19 risk perception or increased isolation driven by undetected COVID-19 spread dampened the influenza season. We suggest that when surveillance for a novel pathogen is limited, surveillance streams of co-circulating infections may provide a signal.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Casey M Zipfel","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Shweta Bansal","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Richard H Rand","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Awadhesh Kumar Singh","author_inst":"GD Hospital and Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"Anoop Misra","author_inst":"Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaney C.

Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show that the inherent randomness of societal processes can lead to a wide range of possible outcomes, both in terms of disease dynamics and mortality, even when the principles according to which policy and population operate are identical.. Our model is easily modified to take other aspects of the socio-pandemic interaction into account.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Axel G Rossberg","author_inst":"School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Robert J.

At the ecological level, regression coefficients are examined to figure out contextual variables influencing the pandemic's exponential growth rate across 96 countries. Results. While a strong institutional context is negatively associated with the outbreak (B = -0.55 ... -0.64, p < 0.001), the pandemic's growth rate is steeper in countries with a quality education system (B = 0.33, p < 0.001). Countries with an older population are more affected (B = 0.46, p < 0.001). Societies with individualistic (rather than collectivistic) values experience a flatter rate of pathogen proliferation (B = -0.31, p < 0.001), similarly for higher levels of power distance (B = -0.32, p < 0.001).

However, specific antiviral drugs are still unavailable, and pateints are managed by multiple complementary treatments. Methods The electronic medical records of COVID-19 patients where basic information, complete blood count, coagulation profile, inflammatory cytokines and serum biochemical indicators in 42 patients with COVID-19 (21 of whom were treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and 21 without LMWH) that were retrospectively analyzed to compare and evaluate the effect of LMWH treatment on disease progression. Findings 42 patients with COVID-19 treated at the hospital between February 1 and March 15, 2020, were selected for the study, of which 21 underwent LMWH treatment (LMWH group), and 21 did not (Control), during hospitalization. Changes in the percentage of lymphocytes in the LMWH group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (p=0.011, respectively). Changes in the levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in the LMWH group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (p=0.002;p=0.035). Strikingly, in the LMWH group, IL-6 levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (p=0.006). Besides, the changes in IL-6 levels in the LMWH group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (p=0.031). Interpretation LMWH improves the coagulation dysfunction of COVID-19 patients and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by reducing IL-6 and increasing lymphocyte %. It appears that LMWH can be used as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19, paving the way for a subsequent well-controlled clinical trial.

Objective: To quantify the impact of increasing COVID-19 infection on extent of psychiatric assessment across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using narrative clinical notes generated between 1\/2\/2020 and 3\/25\/2020 Setting: Emergency department and outpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals Participants: All individuals age 13 and older presenting to emergency department or outpatient clinics Main Outcome or Measure: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms reflecting depression, anxiety, psychosis, or suicide, and documentation of violence, was drawn from previously-validated term lists. Results: A total of 2,483,159 outpatient and 205,957 emergency department visit notes were analyzed. Instances of notes referencing depression or anxiety decreased 75-81% in outpatient settings with onset of coronavirus in March 2019, and by 44-45% in emergency departments. In adjusted logistic regression, presence of individual psychiatric symptoms in outpatient notes was associated with significant decreases in likelihood of coronavirus testing (for depression, OR=0.636, 95% CI 0.606-0.667). Conversely, presence of violence in an emergency department note was associated with greater likelihood of testing (OR=1.487, 95% CI 1.249-1.761). Conclusions and Relevance: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms in both outpatient and emergency department settings diminished sharply in the context of increasing coronavirus infection in Massachusetts, suggesting that efforts to provide additional resources to manage psychiatric symptoms will be needed.

Hence, early surveillance and public health emergency disposal are considered crucial to curb this emerging infectious disease. However, studies that investigated the early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China are relatively few. We aimed to compare the strengths and weaknesses of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for prevention and control between COVID-19 and H7N9 avian influenza, which was commended by the international community, in China. Methods: A case-comparison study was conducted using a set of six key time nodes to form a reference framework for evaluating early surveillance and public health emergency disposal between H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai, China and COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Findings: A report to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China, for the first hospitalized patient was sent after 6 and 20 days for H7N9 avian influenza and COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the pathogen was identified faster in the case of COVID-19 than in the case of H7N9 avian influenza (12 days vs. 31 days). The government response regarding COVID-19 was 10 days later than that regarding avian influenza. The entire process of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal lasted 5 days longer in COVID-19 than in H7N9 avian influenza (46 days vs. 41 days). Conclusions: The identification of the unknown pathogen improved in China between the outbreaks of avian influenza and COVID-19. The longer emergency disposal period in the case of COVID-19 could be attributed to the government's slower response to the epidemic. Improving public health emergency management could lessen the adverse social effects of emerging infectious diseases and public health crisis in the future.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiantian Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenming Shi","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ge Bai","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ruiming Dai","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Li Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"YIHUI LIU","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST), Wuhan, P.R.

Many have implemented nationwide stringent control to avoid overburdening the health care system. This paralyzes economic and social activities until the availability of a vaccine, which may take years. We propose an alternative exit strategy to develop herd immunity in a predictable and controllable way: a phased lift of control. This means that successive parts of the country (e.g. provinces) stop stringent control, and Covid-19-related IC admissions are distributed over the country as the whole. Importantly, vulnerable individuals need to be shielded until herd immunity has developed in their area. We explore the characteristics and duration of this strategy using a novel individual-based model for geographically stratified transmission of Covid-19 in a country. The model predicts that individuals will have to experience stringent control for about 14 months on average, but this duration may be significantly shortened by future developments (more IC beds, better drugs). Clearly, the strategy will have a profound impact on individuals and society, and should therefore be considered carefully by various other disciplines (e.g. health systems, ethics, economics) before actual implementation.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sake J de Vlas","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Luc E.

Fifty percent of respondents had a cycle canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those who had a cycle cancelled, 85% of respondents found it to be moderately to extremely upsetting with 22% rating it to be equivalent to the loss of a child. There was no difference on the emotional impact based on the type of cycle cancelled. Fifty-five percent of patients agreed that diagnostic procedures such as hysterosalpingograms should be cancelled while 36% of patients agreed all fertility cycles should be cancelled. Patients were slightly more likely to agree with the ASRM guidelines if they have an upcoming cycle cancelled (p = 0.041). Of all respondents 82% would have preferred to have the option to start a treatment cycle in consultation with their doctor.

This study proposes an AI model to help hospitals and medical facilities decide who needs to get attention first, who has higher priority to be hospitalized, triage patients when the system is overwhelmed by overcrowding, and eliminate delays in providing the necessary care. The results demonstrate 93% overall accuracy in predicting the mortality rate. We used several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19.

While detailed epidemiological models are certainly needed, I suggest here an orthogonal approach based on a minimum number of parameters robustly fitted from the cumulative data easily accessible for all countries at the John Hopkins University database that became the worldwide reference for the pandemics. I show that, after few days from the beginning of the outbreak, the apparent death rate can be extrapolated to infinite time through regularized regression such as rescaled ridge regression. The variation from country to country of these extrapolated death rates appears to depend almost only (r^2=0.91) on the ratio between performed tests and detected cases even when the instantaneous apparent lethality rates are as different as 9% in Italy and 0.4% in Germany. Extrapolating to the limit of infinite number of tests, I obtain a death rate of 0.012+\/- 0.012, in agreement with other estimates. The inverse relationship between the extrapolated death rate and the intensity tests allows estimating that more than 50% of cases were undetected in most countries, with more than 90% undetected cases in countries severely hit by the epidemics such as Italy. Finally, I propose to adopt the ratio between the cumulative number of recovered and deceased persons as an indicator that can anticipate the halting of the epidemics.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ugo Bastolla","author_inst":"CSIC"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Shakibi","author_inst":"California State University Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Takanao Tanaka","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mary D'Alton","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric J Forman","author_inst":"Columbia University Fertility Center"},{"author_name":"Zev Williams","author_inst":"Columbia University Fertility Center"},{"author_name":"Li Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"YIHUI LIU","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST), Wuhan, P.R.

We found that some countries (such as the US, the UK, and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. At the same time, regardless of the best fitting law, most countries can be shown to follow a trajectory similar to that of Italy, but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with ``younger\" epidemics tend to exhibit more exponential like behavior, while countries that are closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power-law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may not be a consequence of working non-pharmaceutical interventions (except for, perhaps, restricting the air travel). Instead, this is a normal course of raging infection spread. On the practical side, this cautions us against overly optimistic interpretations of the countries epidemic development and emphasizes the need to continue improving the compliance with social distancing behavior recommendations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dominik Wodarz","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Natalia L.

Methods Retrospective data collection on demographics, lifestyles, contact status with infected subjects for 118 HCWs (include 12 COVID-19 HCWs) from a single-center. Sleep quality and working pressure were evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and The Nurse Stress Index (NSI), respectively. Follow-up duration was from Dec 25, 2019, to Feb 15, 2020. Risk factors and transmission models of COVID-19 among HCWs were analyzed and constructed. Findings A high proportion of COVID-19 HCWs had engaged in night shift-work (75.0% vs. 40.6%) and felt they were working under pressure (66.7% vs. 32.1%) than uninfected HCWs. COVID-19 HCWs had higher total scores of PSQI and NSI than uninfected HCWs. Furthermore, these scores were both positively associated with COVID-19 risk. An individual-based model (IBM) estimated the outbreak duration among HCWs in a non-typical COVID-19 ward at 62-80 days and the basic reproduction number =1.27 [1.06, 1.61]. By reducing the average contact rate per HCW by a 1.35 factor and susceptibility by a 1.40 factor, we can avoid an outbreak of the basic case among HCWs. Interpretation Poor sleep quality and high working pressure were positively associated with high risks of COVID-19. A novel IBM of COVID-19 transmission is suitable for simulating different outbreak patterns in a hospital setting.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yansen Bai Sr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Wang Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qimin Huang Sr.","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Han Wang Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"David Gurarie","author_inst":"Center for Global Health and Diseases, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Martial Ndeffo-Mbah","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, College Station"},{"author_name":"Fei Fan","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Peng Fu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mary Ann Horn","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Shuai Xu","author_inst":"Computer and Data Science Department, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Anirban Mondal","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Jiang Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospitaol, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jiang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel J.

At present, we don't have specific medicines or vaccines against novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and our assessment of risk factors for patients with severe pneumonia was limited. In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, we should distinguish between mild and severe patients as early as possible. Objective: To systematically review the evidence of risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic data bases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, Weipu, Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM-SinoMed), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register, and Web of science. The American agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Mata-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0. Results: 20 articles (N=4062 participants) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop into critically ill patients. second, compared with ordinary patients, severe patients had more significant symptom such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, the laboratory test results of severe patients had more abnormal than non-severe patients, such as the elevated levels of white-cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein and procalcitonin, etc, while the decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin, etc. Interpretation: This is the first systematic review investigating the risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The findings are presented and discussed by different clinical characteristics. Therefore, our review may provide guidance for clinical decision-making and optimizes resource allocation.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lizhen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University"},{"author_name":"mao yaqian","author_inst":"Department of endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Chen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Han Wang Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"David Gurarie","author_inst":"Center for Global Health and Diseases, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Martial Ndeffo-Mbah","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, College Station"},{"author_name":"Fei Fan","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Peng Fu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mary Ann Horn","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Shuai Xu","author_inst":"Computer and Data Science Department, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Anirban Mondal","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Jiang Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospitaol, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jiang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel J.
