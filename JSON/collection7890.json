The disease was first identified as a cluster of respiratory illness in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has rapidly spread across the globe to greater than 200 countries. Healthcare providers are at an increased risk for contracting the disease due to occupational exposure and require appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators. The rapid worldwide spread of high numbers of COVID-19 cases has facilitated the need for a substantial supply of PPE that is largely unavailable in many settings, thereby creating critical shortages. Creative solutions for the decontamination and safe reuse of PPE to protect our frontline healthcare personnel are essential. Here, we describe the development of a process that began in late February 2020 for selecting and implementing the use of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) as viable method to reprocess N95 respirators. Since pre-existing HPV decontamination chambers were not available, we optimized the sterilization process in an operating room after experiencing initial challenges in other environments. Details are provided about the prioritization and implementation of processes for collection and storage, pre-processing, HPV decontamination, and post-processing of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Important lessons learned from this experience include, developing an adequate reserve of PPE for effective reprocessing and distribution, and identifying a suitable location with optimal environmental controls (i.e., operating room). Collectively, information presented here provides a framework for other institutions considering decontamination procedures for N95 respirators.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Douglas Jay Perkins","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, Department of Internal Medicine, UNM Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Steven Villescas","author_inst":"University of New Mexico Hospital, Facilities Safety"},{"author_name":"Terry H Wu","author_inst":"Division of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Preventive Medicine, Center for Infectious Disease and Immunity, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New"},{"author_name":"Timothy B Muller","author_inst":"Office of Research, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Steven Bradfute","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences      Center"},{"author_name":"Ivy Foo-Hurwitz","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center"},{"author_name":"Qiuying Cheng","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center"},{"author_name":"Hannah Wilcox","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Myissa Weiss","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Chris Bartlett","author_inst":"Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Jens Langsjoen","author_inst":"Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Phil Seidenberg","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20060335","rel_title":"Clinical features and management of severe COVID-19: A retrospective study in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20060335","rel_abs":"Objective: We aimed to investigate clinical features and management of 55 COVID-19 patients in Wuxi, especially severe COVID-19. Methods: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, treatment, and outcome data of patients were collected. Follow-up lasted until April 6, 2020. Results: All 55 patients included 47 (85.5%) non-severe patients and 8 (14.5%) severe patients. Common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes. Common symptoms were fever, cough and sputum. Lymphopenia was a common laboratory finding, and ground-glass opacity was a common chest CT feature. All patients received antiviral therapy of -interferon inhalation and lopinavir-ritonavir tablets. Common complications included acute liver injury and respiratory failure. All patients were discharged. No death was occurred and no medical staff got infected. Patients with severe COVID-19 showed significantly older age, decreased lymphocytes, increased C reactive protein, and higher frequency of bilateral lung infiltration compared to non-severe patients. Significantly more treatments including antibiotic therapy and mechanical ventilation, longer hospitalization stay and higher cost were shown on severe patients. Conclusions: Our study suggested that patients with severe COVID-19 may be more likely to have an older age, present with lymphopenia and bilateral lung infiltration, receive multiple treatments and stay longer in hospital.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiufeng Jiang","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Tao","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui Wu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yixin Wang","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhao","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Zhou","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiehui Huang","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qian You","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua Meng","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Zhang","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meifang Qian","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuanwang Qiu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20061176","rel_title":"Multi-Stage Group Testing Optimizes COVID-19 Mass Population Testing","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20061176","rel_abs":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 test kits are in critical shortage in many countries. This limits large-scale population testing and hinders the effort to identify and isolate infected individuals. Objectives: Herein, we developed and evaluated multi-stage group testing schemes that test samples in groups of various pool sizes in multiple stages. Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable savings of resources. Study design: We designed and parameterized various multi-stage testing schemes and compared their efficiency at different prevalence rates using computer simulations. Results: We found that three-stage testing schemes with pool sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many individuals with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively. We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based on the expected prevalence rate. Conclusion: These group testing schemes could lead to a major reduction in the number of testing kits required and help improve large-scale population testing in general and in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jens Niklas Eberhardt","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Bonn"},{"author_name":"Nikolas Peter Breuckmann","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Christiane Sigrid Eberhardt","author_inst":"Center for Vaccinology and Department of Pediatrics, University Hospitals of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Yixin Wang","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhao","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Zhou","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiehui Huang","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qian You","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua Meng","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Zhang","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meifang Qian","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuanwang Qiu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20060293","rel_title":"A SIMPLE COLORIMETRIC MOLECULAR DETECTION OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19), AN ESSENTIAL DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR PANDEMIC SCREENING","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20060293","rel_abs":"The recent outbreak of the newly emerged novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) presents a big challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are not available while there is an increasing evidence that the epidemic is more widespread than initially thought, as well as spreading internationally across borders through travellers does already happen warranting a methodology for the rapid detection of the infection to control SARS-CoV-2.

Because of the time constraints associated with the development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19. Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease. Data Sources: The research articles or grey literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from 4 databases and 1 search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about 6 drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and 4 traditional Chinese medicines (Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) were extracted. Conclusions: All of the repurposed drugs that have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas traditional Chinese medicine has a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway, such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This review provides an insight to experimental validation of drugs and alternative medicine used for the treatment and control of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fui Fui Lem","author_inst":"Ministry of Health Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Fernandes Opook","author_inst":"Wildlife Health Genetic and Forensic Laboratory, Wildlife and Health Department"},{"author_name":"Dexter Lee Jiunn Herng","author_inst":"Universiti Malaysia Sabah"},{"author_name":"Chee Fong Tyng","author_inst":"Universiti Malaysia Sabah"},{"author_name":"Fahcina P Lawson","author_inst":"The Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Chin Su Na","author_inst":"Universiti Malaysia Sabah"},{"author_name":"Jiehui Huang","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qian You","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua Meng","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Zhang","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meifang Qian","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuanwang Qiu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20061150","rel_title":"Immunological assays for SARS-CoV-2: an analysis of available commercial tests to measure antigen and antibodies","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20061150","rel_abs":"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection has led to the development of molecular and serologic tests in a short period of time. While tests such as RT-PCR have applications in the immediate diagnosis revealing the presence of the virus, serological tests can be used to determine previous exposure to the virus and complement acute diagnosis. Antibody production can occur as early as 5 days post-infection. Both IgM and IgG specific anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies can be a useful tool to test faster and larger groups of individuals. The objective of this study was to carry out a review of the different serological tests offered to detect antigen or antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This information should be useful for decision takers in different countries to choose a test according to their needs. Based on web pages that listed serological assays, we found 226 coming from 20 countries, the majority are indirect tests for specific antibodies detection (n 180) and use immunochromatography methods (n 110) with samples coming from blood-derived products (n 105). Measuring IgM\/IgG at the same time (n 112) and a procedure time of <20 min (n 83) are the most common. The overall average sensitivity was 91.8% and specificity was 97%.

The susceptibility to infection of populations in that region has been debated. Outbreaks on the scale of those seen elsewhere would pose substantial challenges. There are reasons for concern that transmission may be high and difficult to control, rapidly exceeding capacity to meet the needs for hospitalization and critical care. Methods We obtained data on daily new confirmed cases for all 46 countries from the World Health Organization, and used these to model and visualize growth trajectories using an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. We then estimated doubling times from growth rates estimated from Poisson regression models, and by back counting from the most recent observation. We also calculated the time from 1st to 50th case, and the time from 5th to 100th case. These indicators were compared with the same summary indicators of growth at the same stage of the outbreak in highly affected European countries. Results Kenya was the only country with clear evidence of exponential growth. Nineteen countries had either reported no cases, were in the first few days of the outbreak, or had reported fewer than 10 cases over a period of two or more weeks. For the remaining 27 countries we identified four growth patterns: slow linear growth, more rapid linear growth, variable growth patterns over the course of the outbreak, and early signs of possible exponential growth. For those in the last three groups, doubling times ranged from 3 to 4 days, times from 1st to 50th case from 12 to 29 days, and from 5th to 100th case from eight to 15 days. These early indicators are comparable to those in European countries that have gone on to have substantial outbreaks, and time to 50th case was shorter suggesting lesser effectiveness of contact-tracing and quarantine in the early phase. Conclusion The 46 sub-Saharan African countries, home to over one billion people, are at a tipping point with clear potential for the outbreak to follow a similar course as in HIC in the global north. Radical population-level physical distancing measures may be required, but their impact on poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable people and communities need mitigating. Health systems in the region need urgent technical and material support, with testing, personal protection, and hospital\/ critical care.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin James Prince","author_inst":"King's Global Health Institute, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Atalay Alem","author_inst":"Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Dixon Chibanda","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London UK & Friendship Bench, Harare, Zimbabwe"},{"author_name":"Lara Fairall","author_inst":"University of Cape Town Lung Institute, Cape Town, South Africa & King's Global Health Institute, King's College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Abebaw Fekadu","author_inst":"Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Hanlon","author_inst":"King's Global Health Institute, King's College London, London, UK & Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Crick Lund","author_inst":"King's Global Health Institute, King's College London, London, UK & University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Andrew JM Leather","author_inst":"Global Health Health Partnerships, King's College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Inge Petersen","author_inst":"University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Ruth Verhey","author_inst":"Friendship Bench, Harare, Zimbabwe"},{"author_name":"Haja Wurie","author_inst":"College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences, University of Sierra Leone, Freetown, Sierra Leone"},{"author_name":"Meifang Qian","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuanwang Qiu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20060558","rel_title":"Hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20060558","rel_abs":"Abstract Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus standard-of-care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in adult patients with COVID-19. Design Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting 16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020. Participants 150 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 to SOC alone. Interventions HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild\/moderate or severe patients, respectively). Main outcome measures The primary outcome was whether participants had a negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 by 28 days, and was analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population in which HCQ recipients were participants who actually received at least one dose of HCQ and HCQ non-recipients were those actually managed with SOC alone. Results Among 150 patients, 148 were with mild to moderate disease and 2 were with severe disease. The mean days ({+\/-}standard deviation, min to max) from symptoms onset to randomization was 16.6 ({+\/-}10.5 days, 3 to 41 days). The negative conversion probability by 28 days in SOC plus HCQ group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the SOC group 81.3% (95%CI 71.2% to 89.6%).

The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea, reported in 7 (10%) patients. Two HCQ recipients reported serious adverse events. Conclusions The administration of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher negative conversion probability than SOC alone in patients mainly hospitalized with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19.

Limited data are available characterizing SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States. Objective: To determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care. Exposures: Demographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index). Main Outcomes and Measures: We evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+ among all who tested. Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values. Results: Among Veterans aged 54-75 years, 585\/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19+ (OR 4.68, 95% CI 3.79-5.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.89-3.46). In adjusted models, laboratory abnormalities (especially fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] >3.25 OR 8.73, 95% CI 4.11-18.56), and VACS Index (per 5-point increase OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.43-1.84) were strongly associated with hospitalization. Associations were similar for intensive care. Although significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment. Conclusions and Relevance: Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher T.

Data pertaining to Covid-2019 cases were extracted from Worldometer. Ozone concentration levels were taken from the open-access database of World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). Latitude of specific area where measurement took place was also provided in the database. Preliminary Kendall rank correlation test revealed that Covid-2019 incidence was positively and significantly related to ozone concentration; however, incidence was not significantly related to latitude. Using multivariate linear regression, a statistically significant link between ozone concentration and Covid-2019 incidence in 34 countries was established; however, I found no statistical association between latitude and Covid-2019 incidence refuting previous claims. Prompt health actions should be developed for areas with high ozone concentration in the present and possibly, future outbreaks; however, extensive laboratory analysis should be conducted to further confirm the findings of the study. Nevertheless, the results of this study could serve as a basis for further clinical and large-scale studies.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Marcos Alipio","author_inst":"Davao Doctors College"},{"author_name":"Farah Kidwai-Khan","author_inst":"US Department of Veterans Affairs, Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Janet P.

Methods: The clinical data of 45 moderate and severe type patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections in Jingzhou Central Hospital from January 23 to February 13, 2020 were collected. The epidemiological indexes, clinical symptoms and laboratory test results of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. Those parameters with significant differences between the two groups were analyzed, and the combination parameters with best diagnostic performance were selected using the LDA method. Results: Of the 45 patients with COVID-19 (35 moderate and 10 severe cases), 23 were male and 22 female, aged 16-62 years. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (89%) and dry cough (60%). As the disease progressed, WBC, Neu#, NLR, PLR, RDW-CV and RDW-SD parameters in the severe group were significantly higher than that in the moderate group (P<0.05); meanwhile, Lym#, Eos#, HFC%, RBC, HGB and HCT parameters in the severe group were significantly lower than that in the moderate group (P<0.05). For NLR, the AUC, the best cut-off value, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.890, 13.39, 83.3% and 82.4% respectively, and for PLR , the AUC, the best cut-off, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.842, 267.03, 83.3% and 74.0% respectively. The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD had the best diagnostic efficiency (AUC was 0.938) and when the cut-off value was 1.046, the sensitivity and the specificity were 90.0% and 84.7% respectively, followed by the fitting parameter NLR&RDW-CV (AUC = 0.923). When the cut-off value was 0.62, the sensitivity and the specificity for distinguishing severe type from moderate cases of COVID-19 were 90.0% and 82.4% respectively. Conclusions: The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD is the best hematology index and can help clinicians to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients, and it can be used as a useful indicator to help prevent and control the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"changzheng wang","author_inst":"The Second Clinical Medical College ,Yangtze University"},{"author_name":"Chengbin Li","author_inst":"The Second Clinical Medical College ,Yangtze University"},{"author_name":"Janet P.

Methods: In this retrospective study, we included patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from 20th January 2020 to 15th March 2020. The associations of clinical characteristics and treatment regimens on time to viral RNA clearance were analyzed. Results: We examined 284 consecutive COVID-19 cases, accounting for 82% of confirmed cases in Guangzhou during this period. At the time of reporting (20th March 2020), 276 (97.2%) had recovered and were discharged from hospital with a median hospital stay of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR]:13-24). Overall, 280 patients achieved viral RNA clearance with a median length of 12 days (IQR: 8-16) after onset of illness. Amongst them, 66.1% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, and 89.3% within 21 days. Older age, severity of disease, time lag from illness onset to hospital admission, high body temperature, and corticosteroid use were associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA. None of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, arbidol, and lopinavir\/ritonavir) improved viral RNA clearance. The use of lopinavir\/ritonavir was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA even after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: In patients with COVID-19, isolation for a minimum of 21 days after onset of illness may be warranted, while the use of antiviral drugs does not enhance viral RNA clearance.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xudan Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Baoyi Zhu","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jianwen Zeng","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Wenxin Hong","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Xi He","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jingfeng Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Haipeng Zheng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Shuang Qiu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Ying Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Juliana Chan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Hong Kong Institute of Diabetes and Obesity and Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Science, The Chinese University of Hong"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Kristina Crothers","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tamar H.

Influenza as a respiratory tract infection disease as COVID-19 might also be controlled. To assess the effects, we used the total passenger numbers sent in mainland China from 2018 to 2020 and the daily number of railway passenger (DNRP) flow in 2020 during Spring Festival travel rush to reflect the population movement and further to analyze newly and cumulative confirmed COVID-19 and influenza. We found that with implementing the series measures on COVID-19, not only COVID-19, but also influenza mitigated in China.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis, including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse outcomes in COVID-19, the role of NETs has not been investigated. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 (n=50 patients, n=84 samples) have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase(MPO)-DNA, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter two are highly specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro. In summary, these data reveal high levels of NETs in many patients with COVID-19, where they may contribute to cytokine release and respiratory failure. Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating NETs in longitudinal cohorts, and determine the extent to which NETs may be novel therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Srilakshmi Yalavarthi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Hui Shi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Gockman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Melanie Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A.

The COVID-19 virus is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. However, the fecal-oral transmission of the virus has not been ruled out and it is important to ascertain how acidic condition in the stomach affects the infectivity of the virus. Besides, it is unclear how stable the COVID-19 virus is under dry and wet conditions. In the present study, we have shown that the COVID-19 virus is extremely infectious as manifested by the infection of Vero-E6 cells by one PFU (Plaque Forming Unit) of the virus. We then investigated the stability of the COVID-19 virus in wet, dry and acidic (pH2.2) environments at room temperature. Results showed that the COVID-19 virus could survive for three days in wet and dry environments, but the dry condition is less favorable for the survival of the virus. Our study also demonstrated that the COVID-19 virus at a relative high titer (1.2 x 103 PFU) exhibits a certain degree of tolerance to acidic environment at least for 60 minutes. When the virus titer was [&le;]1.0 x 103 PFU, acid treatment (pH2.2) for 30 or 60 minute resulted in virus inactivation. It suggests that the virus at a high concentration may survive in the acidic environment of the stomach.

There are severe drawbacks to this strategy. The resulting flattened curve remains exponential and always under utilizes available healthcare capacity with a chance of still overburdening it. Moreover, while a mitigation strategy involving isolation and containment can scale down infections, it not only prolongs the outbreak significantly, but also leaves a susceptible population in its wake that's ripe for a secondary outbreak. Since economic activity is inversely proportional to mitigation, curtailing the outbreak with sustained mitigation can stifle the economy severely with disastrous repercussions. Full mitigation for the duration of an outbreak is therefore unsustainable and, overall, a poor solution with potentially catastrophic consequences that could've been avoided. A new strategy, coined a \"Method for Active Pandemic Curve Management\", abbreviated MAPCM, presented herein can shape the outbreak curve in a controlled manner for optimal utilization of healthcare resources during the pandemic, while drastically shortening the outbreak duration compared to mitigation by itself without trading off lives. This method allows mitigation measures to be relaxed gradually from day one, which enables economic activity to resume gradually from the onset of a pandemic. Since outbreak curves (such as hospitalizations) can be programmed using this method, they can also be shaped to accommodate changing needs during the outbreak; and to build herd immunity without the damaging side effects. The method can also be used to ease out of containment. MAPCM is a method and not a model. It is compatible with any appropriate outbreak model; and herein it is illustrated in examples using a hybrid logistic model.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Willem G Odendaal","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"},{"author_name":"Meital Elbaz","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky medical center"},{"author_name":"Ronen Ben-Ami","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David Shasha","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tal Levinson","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Guy Choshen","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ksenia Petrov","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Avi Gadoth","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yael Paran","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xun-jia Cheng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Zheng-hong Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"You-hua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"BSL-3 laboratory of Fudan University, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tamar H.

However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real-time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthias T\u00e4ufer","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Meital Elbaz","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky medical center"},{"author_name":"Ronen Ben-Ami","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David Shasha","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tal Levinson","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Guy Choshen","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ksenia Petrov","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Avi Gadoth","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yael Paran","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xun-jia Cheng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Zheng-hong Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"You-hua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"BSL-3 laboratory of Fudan University, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tamar H.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression in trachea, lung, and small intestine, derive its putative functions, and predict transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 than any other organ. The large intestine, kidney and testis showed moderate signals, whereas the signal was weak in the lung. Single cell RNA-Seq data from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-expressing cells was low in all cell types (<2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and goblet cells. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis\/blood vessel morphogenesis. Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung.\n\nIMPORTANCEVaccines and new medicines are urgently needed to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic, reduce the symptoms, shorten the duration of disease, prevent virus spread in the body, and most importantly to save lives. One of the key drug targets could be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a crucial receptor for the corona virus (SARS-CoV-2). It is known that SARS coronavirus infections lead to worse outcome in the elderly and in males. Therefore, one aim of the present study was to investigate whether age or sex could contribute to the regulation of ACE2 expression. We also decided to explore the transcriptional regulation of ACE2 gene expression. Since data on ACE2 distribution is still conflicting, we aimed to get a more comprehensive view of the cell types expressing the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we studied the coexpression of ACE2 with other genes and explored its putative functions using gene ontology enrichment analysis.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harlan Barker","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Fimlab Ltd, Tampere University Hospital, Finland"},{"author_name":"Seppo Parkkila","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Fimlab Ltd, Tampere University Hospital, Finland"},{"author_name":"Ronen Ben-Ami","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David Shasha","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tal Levinson","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Guy Choshen","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ksenia Petrov","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Avi Gadoth","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yael Paran","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xun-jia Cheng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Zheng-hong Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"You-hua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"BSL-3 laboratory of Fudan University, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tamar H.

The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer. Antibodies to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a closely related coronavirus which emerged in 2002-2003, have been shown to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1 S-protein-mediated entry, and the presence of anti-RBD antibodies correlates with neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. Here we show that immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response in rodents, comparable to 100 {micro}g\/ml of ACE2-Ig, a potent SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor. Importantly, anti-sera from immunized animals did not mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of S-protein-mediated entry under conditions in which Zika virus ADE was readily observed. These data suggest that an RBD-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 could be safe and effective.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian D Quinlan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Huihui Mou","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lizhou Zhang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yan Gao","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Wenhui He","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amrita Ojha","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark S Parcells","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Guangxiang Luo","author_inst":"University of Alabama"},{"author_name":"Wenhui Li","author_inst":"National Institute of Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Scripps Research | SZBL Chemical Biology Institute, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory (SZBL)"},{"author_name":"Hyeryun Choe","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Farzan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"BSL-3 laboratory of Fudan University, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tamar H.

Plenty of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since December 2019. However, animal models, particularly non-human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non-human primates, Old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and New world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12\/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2\/6) M. fascicularis and none (0\/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory samples reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, the tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis. M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by M. fascicularis and C. jacchus.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryM. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to

of people worldwide. There is an urgent call for developing effective drugs against the virus (SARS-CoV-2) causing this disease. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), is highly conserved across coronaviruses and is essential for the maturation process of viral polyprotein. Scutellariae radix (Huangqin in Chinese), the root of Scutellaria baicalensis has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat viral infection related symptoms. The extracts of S. baicalensis have exhibited broad spectrum antiviral activities. We studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredient compounds. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity in vitro and the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with an EC50 of 0.74 g\/ml. Among the major components of S. baicalensis, baicalein strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity with an IC50 of 0.39 M. We further identified four baicalein analogue compounds from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity at microM concentration. Our study demonstrates that the extract of S. baicalensis has effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and baicalein and analogue compounds are strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongbo Liu","author_inst":"College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Fei

samples from publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the sequence read archive repository. Up until March 27, 2020, we downloaded 53 illumina datasets, mostly from China, USA (Washington DC) and Australia (Victoria). Of 30 high quality datasets, 27 datasets (90%) contain at least a single founder mutation and most of the variants are missense (over 63%). Five-point mutations with clonal (founder) effect were found in USA sequencing samples. Sequencing samples from USA in GenBank present this signature with 50% allele frequencies among samples. Australian mutation signatures were more diverse than USA samples, but still, clonal events were found in those samples. Mutations in the helicase and orf1a coding regions from SARS-CoV-2 were predominant, among others, suggesting that these proteins are prone to evolve by natural selection. Finally, we firmly urge that primer sets for diagnosis be carefully designed, since rapidly occurring variants would affect the performance of the reverse transcribed quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) based viral testing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Farkas","author_inst":"Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba,

As SARS-CoV-2 spreads across the planet, speculations remain about the range of human cells that can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from two COVID-19 patients in Toronto, Canada. We determined the genomic sequences of the two isolates and identified single nucleotide changes in representative populations of our virus stocks. More importantly, we tested a wide range of human immune cells for productive infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here we confirm that human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, it is essential to monitor small nucleotide polymorphisms in the virus and to continue to isolate circulating viruses to determine cell susceptibility and pathogenicity using in vitro and in vivo infection models.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arinjay Banerjee","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Jalees A.

Moreover, given to the mechanistic properties of the model, the effect of potential interventions, such as knock-downs, over-expression or drug effects (currently the system models the effect of more than 8000 DrugBank drugs) can be studied in specific conditions. By providing a holistic, systems biology approach to the understanding of the complexities of the viral infection process, this tool will become an important asset in the search for efficient antiviral treatments.\n\nThe tool is freely available at: http:\/\/hipathia.babelomics.org\/covid19\/","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kinza Rian","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Marina Esteban-Medina","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Marta R Hidalgo","author_inst":"Centro de Investigacion Principe Felipe"},{"author_name":"Cankut Cubuk","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Matias M Falco","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Carlos Loucera","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Devrim Gunyel","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Marek Ostaszewski","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Maria Pena-Chilet","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Dopazo","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Matthew S.

Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature and efficacy prediction process 8 siRNA molecules were selected which are proposed to exerts the best action. These predicted siRNAs should effectively silence the genes of SARS-CoV-2 during siRNA mediated treatment assisting in the response against SARS-CoV-2","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Umar Faruq Chowdhury","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Umer Sharif Shohan","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,  University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Kazi Injamamul Hoque","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mirza Ashikul Beg","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Kawsar Sharif Siam","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Brac University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Moni","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Devrim Gunyel","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Marek Ostaszewski","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Maria Pena-Chilet","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Dopazo","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Matthew S.
