Pressing relevance stems from the need to restart the economy dramatically affected by the lockdown. We employ a spatially explicit, data-intensive model of the patterns of disease spread in Italy, which devotes proper attention to the paramount role of inapparent infections. We aim at providing tools to: estimate the baseline trajectory, i.e. the expected unfolding of the outbreak if the current containment measures were kept in place indefinitely; assess possible deviations from the baseline, should relaxations of the current lockdown result in increased disease transmission; and estimate the isolation effort required to prevent a resurgence of the outbreak. A 40% increase in effective transmission as a result of the loosening of confinement measures would yield an epidemic curve that shows a major rebound, larger than the previous peaks in most regions. A control effort capable of isolating a daily percentage of approximately 5.5% of the exposed and highly infectious individuals proves necessary to counterbalance such an increase and maintain the epidemic curve onto the decreasing baseline trajectory. We explore several scenarios, provide the basic data to design the related control strategies, and discuss their feasibility. Should suitable control via tracing and testing prove unfeasible, stop-and-go enforcement or delay of the lockdown relaxations would be necessary to reduce the isolation effort required to maintain the epidemic trajectory under control.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enrico Bertuzzo","author_inst":"University of Venice Ca' Foscari"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mari","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Damiano Pasetto","author_inst":"University of Venice Ca' Foscari"},{"author_name":"Stefano Miccoli","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Renato Casagrandi","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Marino Gatto","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rinaldo","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20083709","rel_title":"Paucity and disparity of publicly available sex-disaggregated data for the COVID-19 epidemic hamper evidence-based decision-making","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20083709","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has joined the long list of human disorders with sexually dimorphic expression. Increased lethality in men was evident in the first large reports from ChinaCDC and WHO-China, and the gender gap appeared even wider in the early Italian outbreak. Newspapers and scientific journals alike have commented on this finding and the preexisting conditions, biological processes, and gender role behavior differences that may underlie it. However, as for other diseases, and in spite of years of advocating for the collection of raw epidemiological data and the analysis of clinical trial data sets by sex, very little appeared to be released about sex differences in characteristics of the epidemics beyond infection and death rates, such as severity of disease, comorbidities, rate of recovery, length of hospital stay, or number of tests for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. These data are critical not only for scientists to understand the pathophysiology of disease, but also to inform decision-making by countries and healthcare systems on how to prioritize testing and best allocate scarce resources and relief funds. Systematic analysis of official websites for the 20 countries and 6 US states reporting the highest number of cases on March 21, 2020, revealed a wide disparity in sex-disaggregated data made available to the public and scholars. Only a handful of the countries reported cases by sex separately. None of the other characteristics, including fatality rates, were stratified by sex at the time. Beyond suboptimal sex disaggregation, our analysis found a paucity of usable raw data sets and a generalized lack of standardization of captured data, making comparisons difficult. A second round of data capture in April found more complete, but even more disparate, information. Our analysis revealed a wide range of sex ratios among confirmed cases, which changed over time. In countries where a male-biased sex ratio was initially reported, the reported proportion of women among cases dramatically increased in under 3 weeks. In contrast, men were consistently over-represented in severe cases, intensive care admissions, and deaths. We also show that the sex ratio varies with age, with a complex pattern, reproduced across the 6 countries for which data were found. Accurate, peer-reviewed, statistical analysis of harmonized, sex-disaggregated data for other characteristics of epidemics, such as availability of testing, suspected source of infection, or comorbidities will be critical to understand where the observed disparities come from and to generate evidence-based recommendations for decision-making by institutions and governments around the world.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristen M Kocher","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Arthur D\u00e9lot-Vilain","author_inst":"Georgetown Day School"},{"author_name":"D'Andre Spencer","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jonathan LoTempio","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Emmanu\u00e8le C D\u00e9lot","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marino Gatto","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rinaldo","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083840","rel_title":"Effect of ethanol cleaning on the permeability of FFP2 mask","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083840","rel_abs":"In this study we assessed the effect of ethanol on the filtering properties of FFP2 masks. The permeability of parts of a FFP2 mask was measured before and after six cleanings with ethanol. As for any porous medium, the filtering properties of a mask are related to the size and tortuosity of the pores of the filter, and are quantified by its permeability. Any damage to the filter will change its permeability. We show here that after six cleaning cycles, the permeability remains very close to the permeability before cleaning. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of protective masks, this study suggests that ethanol could be used to sanitize a FFP2 mask without significantly altering its filtering properties. Additional measurements on FFP2 and N95 masks from different manufacturers need to be performed to validate this study.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roland Lenormand","author_inst":"CYDAREX"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Lenormand","author_inst":"CYDAREX"},{"author_name":"D'Andre Spencer","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jonathan LoTempio","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Emmanu\u00e8le C D\u00e9lot","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marino Gatto","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rinaldo","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20083907","rel_title":"First case of placental infection with SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20083907","rel_abs":"Background: The effects of Covid-19 in pregnancy remain relatively unknown.

Results: SARS-CoV-2 localized predominantly to syncytiotrophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface of the placenta. Histological examination of the placenta revealed a dense macrophage infiltrate, but no evidence for vasculopathy typically associated with preeclampsia. Conclusion: This case demonstrates, for the first time, SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the placenta, highlighting the potential for severe morbidity among pregnant women with Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hillary Hosier","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelli Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaella Morotti","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Uma Deshmukh","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alice Lu-Culligan","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Katherine Campbell","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuki Yasumoto","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chantal Vogels","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Pavithra Vijayakumar","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bertie Geng","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Camila Odio","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Fournier","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anderson Brito","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Joseph Fauver","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Feimei Liu","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tara Alpert","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Reshef Tal","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Klara Szigeti-Buck","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sudhir Perincheri","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Larsen","author_inst":"Arkana Labs"},{"author_name":"Aileen Gariepy","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Aguilar","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kristen Fardelmann","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Malini Harigopal","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hugh Taylor","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christian Pettker","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anne Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aaron Ring","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathan Grubaugh","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tamas Horvath","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Uma Reddy","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heather Lipkind","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"sexual and reproductive health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083261","rel_title":"A Simple Early Warning Signal for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083261","rel_abs":"The paper provides some initial evidence that daily mortality rates (for any cause) by municipality or province can be used as a statistically reliable predictor of looming COVID-19 crises. Using recently published deaths figures for 1,689 Italian municipalities, we estimate the growth in daily mortality rates between the period 2015-2019 and 2020 by province. All provinces that experienced a major COVID-19 shock in mid-March 2020 had increases in mortality rates of 100% or above already in early February 2020. This increase was particularly strong for males and older people, two recognizable features of COVID-19. Using a panel fixed effect model, we show that the association between these early increases in mortality for any cause and the March 2020 COVID-19 shock is strong and significant. We conclude that the growth in mortality rates can be used as a statistically reliable predictor of COVID-19 crises.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lidia Ceriani","author_inst":"Georgetown University, USA"},{"author_name":"Carlos Hernandez-Suarez","author_inst":"Colima University, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Paolo Verme","author_inst":"World bank group"},{"author_name":"Uma Deshmukh","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alice Lu-Culligan","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Katherine Campbell","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuki Yasumoto","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chantal Vogels","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Pavithra Vijayakumar","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bertie Geng","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Camila Odio","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Fournier","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anderson Brito","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Joseph Fauver","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Feimei Liu","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tara Alpert","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Reshef Tal","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Klara Szigeti-Buck","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sudhir Perincheri","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Larsen","author_inst":"Arkana Labs"},{"author_name":"Aileen Gariepy","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Aguilar","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kristen Fardelmann","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Malini Harigopal","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hugh Taylor","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christian Pettker","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anne Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aaron Ring","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathan Grubaugh","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tamas Horvath","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Uma Reddy","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heather Lipkind","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20081026","rel_title":"Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20081026","rel_abs":"We enrolled 53 consecutive in-patients with COVID-19 at six hospitals in Toronto, Canada, and tested one nasopharyngeal swab\/saliva sample pair from each patient for SARS-CoV-2.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the critical enzyme for SARS-CoV-2 infection, is broadly expressed in many organs including heart. However, the cellular distribution of ACE2 in the human heart, particularly the failing heart is unknown. Methods: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in both normal and failing hearts, and characterized the ACE2 gene expression profile in various cell subsets, especially in cardiomyocyte subsets, as well as its interaction with gene networks relating to various defense and immune responses at the single cell level. Results: The results demonstrated that ACE2 is present in cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in the heart, while the number of ACE2-postive (ACE2+) CMs and ACE2 gene expression in these CMs are significantly increased in the failing hearts. Interestingly, both brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are significantly up-regulated in the ACE2+ CMs. Further analysis shows that ANP, BNP and ACE2 may form a negative feedback loop with a group of genes associated with the development of heart failure. To our surprise, we found that genes related to virus entry, virus replication and suppression of interferon-gamma signaling are all up-regulated in CMs in failing hearts, and the increases were significantly higher in ACE2+ CMs as compared with ACE2 negative (ACE2-) CMs, suggesting that these ACE2+ CMs may be more vulnerable to virus infection. Since ACE2 expression is correlated with BNP expression, we further performed retrospective analysis of the plasma BNP levels and clinic outcome of 91 COVID-19 patients from a single-center. Patients with higher plasma BNP were associated with significantly higher mortality rate and expression levels of inflammatory and infective markers such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Conclusion: In the failing heart, the upregulation of ACE2 and virus infection associated genes, as well as the increased expression of ANP and BNP could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and replication in these vulnerable cardiomyocyte subsets. These findings may advance our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of myocarditis associated with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaojiang Xu","author_inst":"NIEHS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Dachun Xu","author_inst":"Tongji University School of Medicine,PR.

We evaluated risk for COVID-19 among frontline HCWs compared to the general community and the influence of PPE. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of the general community, including frontline HCWs, who reported information through the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application beginning on March 24 (United Kingdom, U.K.) and March 29 (United States, U.S.) through April 23, 2020. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of a positive COVID-19 test. Findings: Among 2,035,395 community individuals and 99,795 frontline HCWs, we documented 5,545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34,435,272 person-days. Compared with the general community, frontline HCWs had an aHR of 11.6 (95% CI: 10.9 to 12.3) for reporting a positive test. The corresponding aHR was 3.40 (95% CI: 3.37 to 3.43) using an inverse probability weighted Cox model adjusting for the likelihood of receiving a test. A symptom-based classifier of predicted COVID-19 yielded similar risk estimates. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE, the aHRs for reporting a positive test were 1.46 (95% CI: 1.21 to 1.76) for those reporting PPE reuse and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.56) for reporting inadequate PPE. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE who did not care for COVID-19 patients, HCWs caring for patients with documented COVID-19 had aHRs for a positive test of 4.83 (95% CI: 3.99 to 5.85) if they had adequate PPE, 5.06 (95% CI: 3.90 to 6.57) for reused PPE, and 5.91 (95% CI: 4.53 to 7.71) for inadequate PPE. Interpretation: Frontline HCWs had a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 infection, highest among HCWs who reused PPE or had inadequate access to PPE. However, adequate supplies of PPE did not completely mitigate high-risk exposures.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Long H.

It requires weather (environmental) factors to be included in prediction models, but there are few models to achieve it successfully. In this study, we proposed a new concept of environmental infection rate (RE), based on floating time of respiratory droplets in the air and inactivation rate of virus to solve the problem. More than half of the particles in the droplets can float in the atmosphere for 1-2 hours. The prediction results showed that high RE values (>3.5) are scattered around 30N in winter (Dec.-Feb.). As the weather warms, its distribution area expands and extends to higher latitudes of northern hemisphere, reaching its maximum in April, and then shrinking northward. These indicated that the spread of COVID-19 in most parts of the northern hemisphere is expected to decline after Apr., but the risks in high latitudes will remain high in May. In the south of southern hemisphere, the RE values tend to subside from Apr. to July. The high modeled RE values up to July, however, suggested that warmer weather will not stop COVID-19 from spreading.

Limitation of the pandemic is mainly facilitated by reducing infections. An effective strategy is social distancing. However, this strategy draws more and more criticism, in Germany as elsewhere, because of its economic and psychological consequences for society. How can the number of infected person be held below the medical care capacity while restrictions affecting the general public are minimized? Various approaches exist to retarding the infection rate during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak until vaccine has been developed, without overloading medical capacity. Options being discussed include large-scale testing, contact tracing and social distancing. A study published by the Imperial College contains a model calculation of the effects of alternating school closings and openings in the United States and the United Kingdom. However, no satisfactory solution was developed. Variables which describe the medical care resources in Germany and the age and occupational structure of its population contrast sharply with American and British conditions. This study attempts to apply the Imperial College approach of alternating quarantine and normal episodes for the entire population. Mathematically, an oscillation in hospitalization can be imposed. The difficulty lies in determining the non-controllable parameters related to the virus. Varying the ambiguously quantified input variables is investigated in an attempt to devise a strategy for all combinations that does not overload the clinical system.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carolin Knoch","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Xiao","author_inst":"East China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Renguo Zhu","author_inst":"East China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Chengxing Sun","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Liu","author_inst":"East China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Huayun Xiao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Daniel R.

To date, however, no large sample size study focusing on gastrointestinal symptoms in pediatric cases has been published. We analyzed COVID-19 infected children in Wuhan who presented with initial GI symptoms to determine the GI characteristics and epidemiological trend of the disease. Design: We retrospectively analyzed 244 children patients confirmed with COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital from 21 Jan to 20 Mar 2020. Symptomatic cases were divided into two groups according to whether the patients presented with or without GI symptoms on admission. Demographic, epidemiological, symptoms, and laboratory data were compared. We also analyzed the respective trends of case number changes of GI cases and asymptomatic cases. Results: 34 out of 193 symptomatic children had GI symptoms. They had lower median age and weight, a higher rate of fever, a longer length of stay and more hematological and biochemical abnormalities than patients without GI symptoms. There was no significant difference in chest CT findings or stool SARS-CoV-2 test positive percentages between the two groups. The number of patients admitted with GI symptoms showed an overall downward trend with time. At the time of writing, 242 patients were discharged, one died, and one critically ill patient was still in the intensive care unit. Conclusion: COVID-19 infected children with GI symptoms are prone to presenting with more clinical and laboratory abnormalities than patients without GI symptoms. More attention and timely hospital admission are needed for these patients.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoli Xiong","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenenth Kak-Yuen Wong","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shuiqing Chi","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Aifen Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianqiao Tang","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lishan Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ho-yu Chung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilbert Chua","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Keith TS Tung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ian CK Wong","author_inst":"The Univeristy of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Celine SL Chui","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xue Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Mike Yat-wah Kwan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wilfred HS Wong","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marco Hok-kung Ho","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Godfrey CF Chan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Cao","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Kang Li","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ip","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peng Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaotao Tang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Paul KH Tam","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Mark Graham","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carol H.

Little is known about COVID-19 testing rates and COVID-19 test outcomes in people with mental illness. We hypothesized that people with psychiatric disorders are less likely to undergo COVID-19 testing and more likely to test positive. Methods We used data on COVID-19 testing in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort to compare the prevalence of COVID-19 testing and test outcomes among individuals with psychiatric disorders to those without such diagnoses. We further investigated associations of testing probability and outcome with psychiatric diagnostic categories. Outcomes Individuals with psychiatric disorders were overrepresented among the 1 474 UKB participants with test data: 23% of the COVID-19 test sample had a psychiatric diagnosis compared to 10% in the full cohort (p<0.0001). This overrepresentation persisted for each of the specific psychiatric disorders tested. Furthermore, individuals with a psychiatric disorder (p=0.01), particularly with substance use disorder (p<0.005), had negative test results significantly more often than individuals without psychiatric disorders. Sensitivity analyses confirmed our results. Interpretation In contrast with our hypotheses, UKB participants with psychiatric disorders have been tested for COVID-19 more frequently than individuals without a psychiatric history, pleading against the notion that limited health care access is preventing them from undergoing testing. Among those tested, test outcomes were more frequently negative for UKB participants with psychiatric disorders than in others, countering arguments that people with mental illness are more prone to contract the virus.

This study uses all-cause daily death registrations data provided by the Italian Statistical Office (ISTAT) focusing on the five most severely hit provinces in Italy (Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lodi and Piacenza) and Lombardy region. We calculate excess mortality in 2020 compared to the average of the years 2015-2019 and estimate life expectancy for the first wave of the epidemic and for the rest of the year 2020. The estimated excess deaths show significantly higher mortality than official statistics, particularly during the peak of the epidemic and amongst people aged [&ge;]70 years. For the first wave of the epidemic (1 January to 30 April 2020), life expectancy in the five provinces reduced by 6.2 to 8 and 3.6 to 5.8 years for men and women, respectively. For annual life expectancy in 2020, with regular after-COVID mortality patterns, the years of life lost is equivalent to 2.5 to 4.1 years for men and 1.7. to 2.6 years for women, respectively.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simone Ghislandi","author_inst":"Bocconi University"},{"author_name":"Raya Muttarak","author_inst":"Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (Univ.

This paper sheds light on the preparedness of the healthcare system by examining the spatial distribution of isolation beds across districts and divisions, forecasting the number of ICU units that may be required in the short term and analyzing the availability of frontline healthcare workers to combat the pandemic. As of May 2, COVID-19 cases have been found in 61 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh with Dhaka District being the epicenter. Seventy-one percent of the cases have been identified in 6 neighboring districts, namely, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi, Munsiganj and Kishoreganj, which appear to form a spatial cluster. However, if one takes into account the population at risk, the prevalence appears to be highest in Dhaka, followed by Narayanganj, Gazipur, Kishorganj, Narsingdi and Munshiganj. These regions may therefore be flagged as the COVID-19 hotspots in Bangladesh. Among the eight divisions, prevalence is highest in Dhaka Division followed by Mymensingh. The number of cases per million exceeds the number of available isolation beds per million in the major hotspots indicating that there is a risk of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed should the number of cases rise. This is especially true for Dhaka Division, where the ratio of COVID-19 patients to doctors appears to be alarmingly high. Mymensingh Division also has a disproportionately small number of doctors relative to the number of COVID-19 patients. Using second order polynomial regression, the analysis predicts that even if all ICU beds are allocated to COVID-19 patients, Bangladesh may run out of ICU beds soon after May 15, 2020. We conclude that in spite of a significant increase in hospital capacity during 2005-15 and a 57 % rise in the number of doctors during the same period, the healthcare system in Bangladesh and Dhaka Division in particular, may not be fully prepared to handle the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, further steps need to be taken to flatten the curve and improve healthcare capacity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasinur Rahaman Khan","author_inst":"ISRT, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tamanna Howlader","author_inst":"ISRT, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

There are likely a number of factors one can attribute to such disparity, not least of which is differing healthcare models and approaches. Here, we examine the COVID-19 related health advice issued by six different countries, specifically examining the patient-led triage pathways in each country. Methods: A simulation study was conducted on current, nationwide, patient-led triage systems from three countries with low case fatality rates (Singapore, Norway and Japan) and two countries with high case fatality rates (the USA and the UK). Cases were simulated by clinicians to approximate typical COVID-19 presentations (mild, severe and critical), and COVID-19 mimickers (sepsis, bacterial pneumonia). The same simulations were applied to each of the five countrys patient-led triage systems, and the recommendations to refer on for medical care or to advise to stay at home were recorded and compared. Statistical analysis examined the potential correlation between triage outcomes and case fatality rates. Results: Patient-led triage systems from Singapore, Japan and Norway maintained a low threshold for advising clinical contact for patients with possible COVID-19 (88 to 100% of cases were referred). Patient-led triage systems from the USA and the UK maintained high thresholds for advising contact with either call centre support or clinical contact (28 and 33% of cases were referred, respectively), and triaged the majority of cases home with no further healthcare input. There was a strong inverse correlation between percentage of cases referred and the nations case fatality rate (Pearsons Correlation = -0.642, p = 0.01). Conclusion: In this simulation study, the triage algorithms of Singapore, Norway and Japan successfully identified severe COVID-19 and triaged such cases to medical care. The USA triage system and the UKs triage system performed poorly, failing to identify severe COVID-19 infection and sepsis. In this study, the performance of national COVID-19 triage systems strongly correlate with case fatality rates.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatma Mansab","author_inst":"Public Health Gibraltar"},{"author_name":"Sohail Bhatti","author_inst":"Post-graduate Medical School, University of Gibraltar"},{"author_name":"Daniel Goyal","author_inst":"Gibraltar Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Yasin Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto.

The diameter in current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row-column group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ozkan Ufuk Nalbantoglu","author_inst":"Erciyes University"},{"author_name":"Sohail Bhatti","author_inst":"Post-graduate Medical School, University of Gibraltar"},{"author_name":"Daniel Goyal","author_inst":"Gibraltar Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Yasin Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto.

Detailed knowledge of the molecular biology of the infection is indispensable for understanding of the viral replication, host responses, and disease progression. We provide gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in three human cell lines (H1299, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells), using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. Small RNA profiling showed strong expression of the immunity and inflammation-associated microRNA miRNA-155 upon infection with both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 elicited approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the interferon response compared to SARS-CoV in the permissive human epithelial cell line Calu-3, and induction of cytokines such as CXCL10 or IL6. Single cell RNA sequencing data showed that canonical interferon stimulated genes such as IFIT2 or OAS2 were broadly induced, whereas interferon beta (IFNB1) and lambda (IFNL1-4) were expressed only in a subset of infected cells. In addition, temporal resolution of transcriptional responses suggested interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) activities precede that of nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B). Lastly, we identified heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as a protein relevant for the infection. Inhibition of the HSP90 charperone activity by Tanespimycin\/17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) resulted in a reduction of viral replication, and of TNF and IL1B mRNA levels. In summary, our study established in vitro cell culture models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified HSP90 protein as potential drug target for therapeutic intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emanuel Wyler","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Kirstin M\u00f6sbauer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Vedran Franke","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Asija Diag","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Lina Theresa Gottula","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Roberto Arsie","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Filippos Klironomos","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association; Department of Pediatrics, Charite - Unive"},{"author_name":"David Koppstein","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Salah Ayoub","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Christopher Buccitelli","author_inst":"Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Anja Richter","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Ivano Legnini","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Andranik Ivanov","author_inst":"Core Unit Bioinformatics, Berlin Institute of Health, Charite - University Hospital Berlin"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Mari","author_inst":"Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Simone Del Giudice","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Jan Patrick Papies","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Marcel Alexander M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Daniela Niemeyer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthias Selbach","author_inst":"Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Altuna Akalin","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Rajewsky","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Markus Landthaler","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Carol H.

Although the majority of COVID-19 patients experience only mild or moderate symptoms, a subset will progress to severe disease with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Emerging results indicate a dysregulated immune response characterized by runaway inflammation, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), as the major driver of pathology in severe COVID-19. With no treatments currently approved for COVID-19, therapeutics to prevent or treat the excessive inflammation in severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. Here, in 10 terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients we report profound elevation of plasma IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES), decreased CD8+ T cell levels, and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. Following compassionate care treatment with the CCR5 blocking antibody leronlimab, we observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy on macrophage and T cells, rapid reduction of plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4\/CD8 ratio, and a significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. Consistent with reduction of plasma IL-6, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed declines in transcriptomic myeloid cell clusters expressing IL-6 and interferon-related genes. These results demonstrate a novel approach to resolving unchecked inflammation, restoring immunologic deficiencies, and reducing SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load via disruption of the CCL5-CCR5 axis, and support randomized clinical trials to assess clinical efficacy of leronlimab-mediated inhibition of CCR5 for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bruce K Patterson","author_inst":"IncellDX"},{"author_name":"Harish Seethamraju","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kush Dhody","author_inst":"Amarex Clinical Research, LLC"},{"author_name":"Michael J Corley","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Kazemm Kazempour","author_inst":"Amarex Clinical Research"},{"author_name":"Jay P Lalezari","author_inst":"Quest Clinical Research"},{"author_name":"Alina PS Pang","author_inst":"University of Hawaii"},{"author_name":"Christopher Sugai","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Edgar B Francisco","author_inst":"IncellDX"},{"author_name":"Amruta Pise","author_inst":"IncellDX"},{"author_name":"Hallison Rodrigues","author_inst":"IncellDX"},{"author_name":"Matthew Ryou","author_inst":"IncellDX"},{"author_name":"Helen L Wu","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"Gabriela M Webb","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"Byung S Park","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"Scott Kelly","author_inst":"CytoDyn, Inc"},{"author_name":"Nadar Pourhassan","author_inst":"CytoDyn, Inc"},{"author_name":"Alena Lelic","author_inst":"Beckman Coulter"},{"author_name":"Lama Kdouh","author_inst":"Beckman Coulter"},{"author_name":"Monica Herrera","author_inst":"Bio-Rad, Inc"},{"author_name":"Eric Hall","author_inst":"Bio-Rad, Inc"},{"author_name":"Enver Aklin","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lishomwa Ndhlovu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jonah B Sacha","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"M.

Certain individuals, when infected by SARS-CoV-2, tend to develop the more severe forms of Covid-19 illness for reasons that remain unclear. Methods. We studied N=442 patients who presented with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 illness to our U.S. metropolitan healthcare system. We curated data from the electronic health record, and used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of pre-existing traits with a Covid-19 illness severity defined by level of required care: need for hospital admission, need for intensive care, and need for intubation. Results. Of all patients studied, 48% required hospitalization, 17% required intensive care, and 12% required intubation. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, patients requiring a higher levels of care were more likely to be older (OR 1.5 per 10 years, P<0.001), male (OR 2.0, P=0.001), African American (OR 2.1, P=0.011), obese (OR 2.0, P=0.021), with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, P=0.037), and with a higher comorbidity index (OR 1.8 per SD, P<0.001). Several clinical associations were more pronounced in younger compared to older patients (Pinteraction<0.05). Of all hospitalized patients, males required higher levels of care (OR 2.5, P=0.003) irrespective of age, race, or morbidity profile. Conclusions. In our healthcare system, greater Covid-19 illness severity is seen in patients who are older, male, African American, obese, with diabetes, and with greater overall comorbidity burden. Certain comorbidities paradoxically augment risk to a greater extent in younger patients. In hospitalized patients, male sex is the main determinant of needing more intensive care. Further investigation is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these findings.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph E.

Since COVID-19 testing is now available, some have raised the question of whether we should be routinely testing asymptomatic healthcare workers. Methods: Using publicly available data on COVID-19 infections and emergency department visits, as well as internal hospital staffing information, we generated a mathematical model to predict the impact of periodic COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic members of the emergency department staff in regions affected by COVID-19 infection. We calculated various transmission constants based on the Diamond Princess cruise ship data, used a logistic model to calculate new infections, and we created a Markov model according to average COVID-19 incubation time. Results: Our model predicts that after 30 days, with a transmission constant of 1.219e-4 new infections per person2, weekly COVID-19 testing of healthcare workers (HCW) would reduce new HCW and patient infections by 5.1% and bi-weekly testing would reduce both by 2.3%. At a transmission constant of 3.660e-4 new infections per person,2 weekly testing would reduce infections by 21.1% and bi-weekly testing would reduce infections by 9.7-9.8%. For a lower transmission constant of 4.067e-5 new infections per person2, weekly and biweekly HCW testing would result in a 1.54% and 0.7% reduction in infections respectively. Conclusion: Periodic COVID-19 testing for emergency department staff in regions that are heavily-affected by COVID-19 and\/or facing resource constraints may reduce COVID-19 transmission significantly among healthcare workers and previously-uninfected patients.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuemei Zhang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Sheng-Ru Cheng","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Ji","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Brian L.

A critical metric in the performance evaluation for a diagnostic test kit is the analytical sensitivity, which is measured by the limit of detection (LOD). Commercial RNA stocks with known titers are used to determine LOD. We identified a problem with the titer reported for the commercial stocks when examining the analytical sensitivity of the reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) protocol that is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using plasmid DNA from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), synthetic RNA from BEI Resources (BEI), and extracted genomic RNA from BEI. We detected 3\/3 positives for reactions containing synthetic RNA at a concentration of 0.1 copies\/reaction (based on the supplier's label concentration). The apparent better-than-single-molecule performance is a statistically highly unlikely event, indicating a potential inaccuracy in the supplier's quantification of the stock material. Using an ultrasensitive and precise assay, reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR), we independently quantified concentrations of commercial SARS-CoV-2 plasmid DNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA stocks. For plasmid DNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR was 11% of the nominal label concentration. For synthetic RNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 770% of the label concentration and for a different lot was 57% of the label concentration. For genomic RNA, the concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 240% of the label concentration and for a different lot it was 300% of the label concentration. This SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA from BEI Resources has been used in at least 11 approved FDA Emergency Use Authorizations as of April 27, 2020. Such deviations of reported RNA or DNA stock concentrations from true concentrations can result in inaccurate quantification and calculation of LOD.

The requirements for the procedure are the test's sample size (N) and total number of positives (X), and the data on test's reliability. The modus is the prior which generates the largest frequency of observations in the MC simulation with precisely the number of test positives (maximum-likelihood estimator). The median is the upper bound of the set of priors accounting for half of the total relevant observations in the MC simulation with numbers of positives identical to the test's number of positives. Our rather preliminary findings are: The median and the confidence intervals suffice universally; The estimator X\/N may be outside of the two-sided 95% confidence interval; Conditions such that the modus, the median and another promising estimator which takes the reliability of the test into account, are quite close; Conditions such that the modus and the latter estimator must be regarded as logically inconsistent; Conditions inducing rankings among various estimators relevant for issues concerning over- or underestimation.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reinoud Joosten","author_inst":"University of Twente"},{"author_name":"Abhishta Abhishta","author_inst":"University of Twente"},{"author_name":"Janis M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Steffen Stenger","author_inst":"Institute for Microbiology and Hygiene, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Karin Steinhart","author_inst":"Administrative District Heidenheim, Public Health Office, Heidenheim, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Kirchhoff","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jan M\u00fcnch","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Eric Luong","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth H.

To date, the hyperglycemia has been shown to increase IL-6 and IL-6R, which has been suggested as a severity predictor in lung diseases of Covid-19 patients. However, there are no data about the effects of tocilizumab therapy on outcomes of hyperglycemic Covid-19 patients with pneumonia. To investigate this unsolved need, 475 Covid-19 positive patients were retrospectively studied since March 1st, 2020. Among them, 78 patients with pneumonia disease and treated with tocilizumab were further evaluated for a severe outcome (encompassing both the use of mechanical ventilation and\/or death). Thirty-one (39.7%) hyperglycemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycemic Covid-19 positive patients (blood glucose levels >140 mg\/dl, at admission and\/or during hospital stay) were evaluated. Noteworthy, 20 (64%) of hyperglycemic and 11 (23.4%) of normoglycemic patients were also diabetics (P<0.01). At admission, more elevated IL-6 levels in hyperglycemic patients were found and persists even after Tocilizumab administration. In a risk adjusted Cox-regression analysis, Tocilizumab in hyperglycemic did not attenuate the risks of severe outcome as did in normoglycemic patients (p<0.009). Therefore, we could conclude that reduced effects of Tocilizumab in hyperglycemic patients may due to the higher plasma IL-6 levels. Interestingly, when we added IL-6 levels in a Cox regression model the significance for the tocilizumab effect was lost (p<0.07). In this context, our observations evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with tocilizumab is not achieved during hyperglycemia both in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raffaele Marfella","author_inst":"University of Campania"},{"author_name":"Pasquale Paolisso","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Celestino Sardu","author_inst":"University of Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\""},{"author_name":"Luca Bergamaschi","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Concetta D' Angelo","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Michelangela Barbieri","author_inst":"University of Campania"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Rizzo","author_inst":"University of Campania"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Messina","author_inst":"University of Campania"},{"author_name":"Paolo Maggi","author_inst":"University of Campania"},{"author_name":"Nicola Coppola","author_inst":"University of Campania"},{"author_name":"Carmine Pizzi","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Biffi","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Viale","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Nazzareno Galie","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Paolisso","author_inst":"University of Campania"},{"author_name":"Tanzira Zaman","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Thompson","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Koen Raedschelders","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anders H.
