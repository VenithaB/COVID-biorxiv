Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was tested using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10.90 and 10.85% in influent water and 3.29 and 6.19 in effluent water samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater waters of 5.38 log genomic copies\/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating among the population even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Walter Randazzo","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Ecology, University of Valencia, Av.

Given the contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To be effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator without impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this work we describe a microwave-generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in healthcare systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1100W commercially available microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology against MS2 phage, a highly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we report an average 6-log10 plaque forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log10 PFU (99.999%) reduction after a single three-minute microwave treatment. Notably, quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means of effective decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers facing urgent need.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kate E Zulauf","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alex B Green","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alex N.

Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection uses the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individual's genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population biobank, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed a suggestive association of polymorphisms within the ACE2 gene with (1) the use of ARBs combination therapies (p=5.7x10-4), an association that is significantly stronger in females (pdiff=0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p=5.5x10-4). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants play a role in diseases such as hypertension and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases. Further investigation of these genetic variants in the context of COVID-19 is thus promising for better understanding of disease variability.

Amplification of viral RNA by (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the current gold standard test for confirmation of infection, although it presents known shortcomings: long turnaround times (3-4 hours to generate results), potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates as large as 15-20%, the need for certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus there is a need for alternative, faster, less expensive and more accessible tests. Material and methods - We developed two machine learning classification models using hematochemical values from routine blood exams (namely: white blood cells counts, and the platelets, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, LDH plasma levels) drawn from 279 patients who, after being admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) emergency-room with COVID-19 symptoms, were screened with the rRT-PCR test performed on respiratory tract specimens. Of these patients, 177 resulted positive, whereas 102 received a negative response. Results - We have developed two machine learning models, to discriminate between patients who are either positive or negative to the SARS-CoV-2: their accuracy ranges between 82% and 86%, and sensitivity between 92% e 95%, so comparably well with respect to the gold standard. We also developed an interpretable Decision Tree model as a simple decision aid for clinician interpreting blood tests (even off-line) for COVID-19 suspect cases. Discussion - This study demonstrated the feasibility and clinical soundness of using blood tests analysis and machine learning as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19 positive patients. This is especially useful in those countries, like developing ones, suffering from shortages of rRT-PCR reagents and specialized laboratories. We made available a Web-based tool for clinical reference and evaluation.

Lesson from the first lockdown","rel_date":"2020-04-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20075499","rel_abs":"The novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has created a medical emergency worldwide. It has spread rapidly to multiple countries and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In India, it is already reported more than 18 thousand cases and more than 600 deaths due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) till April 20, 2020. Previous studies on various viral infections like influenza have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that the cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments favor the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases. These viral transmissions found attenuated in warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments. However, the role of temperature, humidity, and absolute humidity in the transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been well established. Therefore the study to investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of COVID-19 infection, to predict the epidemiology of the infectious disease, and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease is required for India. In this work, we analyze the local weather patterns of the Indian region affected by the COVID-19 virus for March and April months, 2020. We have investigated the effect of meteorological parameters like Temperature, relative humidity, and absolute humidity on the rate of spread of COVID-19 using daily confirm cases in India. We have used daily averaged meteorological data for the last three years (2017-2019) for March and April month and the same for the year 2020 for March 1 to April 15. We found a positive association (Pearsons r=0.56) between temperature and daily COVID-19 cases over India. We found a negative association of humidity (RH and AH) with daily COVID-19 Cases (Persons r=-0.62, -0.37). We have also investigated the role of aerosol in spreading the pandemic across India because its possible airborne nature. For this, we have investigated the association of aerosols (AOD) and other pollutions (NO2) with COVID-19 cases during the study period and also during the first lockdown period (25 March-15 April) in India. We found a negative association in March when there were few cases, but in April, it shows positive association when the number of cases is more (for AOD it was r=-0.41 and r=0.28 respectively). During the lockdown period, aerosols (AOD) and other pollutants (NO2; an indicator of PM2.5) reduced sharply with a percentage drop of about 36 and 37, respectively. This reduction may have reduced the risk for COVID-19 through air transmission due to the unavailability of aerosol particles as a base. HYSPLIT forward trajectory model also shows that surface aerosols may travel up to 4 km according to wind and direction within three h of its generation. If coronavirus becomes airborne as suggested by many studies, then it may have a higher risk of transmission by aerosols particles. So relaxing in the lockdown and environmental rules in terms of pollutant emissions from power plants, factories, and other facilities would be a wrong choice and could result in more COVID-19 incidences and deaths in India. Therefore the current study, although limited, suggests that it is doubtful that the spread of COVID-19 would slow down in India due to meteorological factors, like high temperature and high humidity. Because a large number of cases have already been reported in the range of high Tem, high Relative, and high absolute humidity regions of India. Thus our results in no way suggest that COVID-19 would not spread in warm, humid regions or during summer\/monsoon. So effective public health interventions should be implemented across India to slow down the transmission of COVID-19. If COVID-19 is indeed sensitive to environmental factors, it could be tested in the coming summer-monsoon for India. So the only summer is not going to help India until monsoon is coming. Only government mitigations strategies would be helpful, whether its lockdown, aggressive and strategic testing, medical facilities, imposing social distancing, encouraging to use face mask or monitoring by a mobile application (Aarogya Setu).","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarvan Kumar","author_inst":"Purvanchal University, Jaunpur, India"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campagner","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca"},{"author_name":"Davide Ferrari","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Parma"},{"author_name":"Massimo Locatelli","author_inst":"Ospedale San Raffaele"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Banfi","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 Vita e Salute San Raffaele Milano"},{"author_name":"Federico Cabitza","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca"},{"author_name":"Morris Swertz","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lude Franke","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Cisca Wijmenga","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Patrick Deelen","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Zhernakova","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Serena Sanna","author_inst":"Istituto di Neurogenetica e Neurofarmacologia del CNR, Department of Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Groningen, The Net"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20074336","rel_title":"An international characterisation of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and a comparison with those previously hospitalised with influenza","rel_date":"2020-04-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20074336","rel_abs":"Background In this study we phenotyped individuals hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in depth, summarising entire medical histories, including medications, as captured in routinely collected data drawn from databases across three continents. We then compared individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 to those previously hospitalised with influenza. Methods We report demographics, previously recorded conditions and medication use of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the US (Columbia University Irving Medical Center [CUIMC], Premier Healthcare Database [PHD], UCHealth System Health Data Compass Database [UC HDC], and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA OMOP]), in South Korea (Health Insurance Review & Assessment [HIRA]), and Spain (The Information System for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP] and HM Hospitales [HM]). These patients were then compared with patients hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19. Results 34,128 (US: 8,362, South Korea: 7,341, Spain: 18,425) individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 were included. Between 4,811 (HM) and 11,643 (CUIMC) unique aggregate characteristics were extracted per patient, with all summarised in an accompanying interactive website (http:\/\/evidence.ohdsi.org\/Covid19CharacterizationHospitalization\/). Patients were majority male in the US (CUIMC: 52%, PHD: 52%, UC HDC: 54%, VA OMOP: 94%,) and Spain (SIDIAP: 54%, HM: 60%), but were predominantly female in South Korea (HIRA: 60%). Age profiles varied across data sources. Prevalence of asthma ranged from 4% to 15%, diabetes from 13% to 43%, and hypertensive disorder from 24% to 70% across data sources. Between 14% and 33% were taking drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system in the 30 days prior to hospitalisation. Compared to 81,596 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, patients admitted with COVID-19 were more typically male, younger, and healthier, with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. Conclusions We provide a detailed characterisation of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Protecting groups known to be vulnerable to influenza is a useful starting point to minimize the number of hospital admissions needed for COVID-19. However, such strategies will also likely need to be broadened so as to reflect the particular characteristics of individuals hospitalised with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":69,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Seng Chan You","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Anthony Sena","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Kostka","author_inst":"Real World Solution, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hamed Abedtash","author_inst":"Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza F.

These contained 3189 patients, of whom 732 were severely affected (severe group) and 3189 were in non-severe group. Using the random-effects model, our meta-analyses showed that the odds of comorbidities, including COPD, DM, HTN, CVD, CKD, and symptoms, including dyspnea, dizziness, anorexia, and cough, were significantly higher among the severe group compared with the non-severe group. There were no significant changes in odds of CVA, liver disease, immunodeficiency\/immunosuppression, fever, fatigue, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, sore throat, nasal congestion, sputum, nausea, vomiting, chest pain between the two groups. Conclusions Early recognition and intervention can be critical in management, and might stop progression to severe disease. Predictive symptoms and comorbidities can be used as a predictor in patients who are at risk of severe disease.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reza Tabrizi","author_inst":"Health Policy Research Center, Institute of Health, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Kamran B Lankarani","author_inst":"Health Policy Research Center, Institute of Health, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Peyman Nowrouzi-sohrabi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mojtaba Shabani-Borujeni","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Shahla Rezaei","author_inst":"School of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mahnaz Hosseini-bensenjan","author_inst":"Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Sina vakili","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Seyed Taghi Heydari","author_inst":"Health Policy Research Center, Institute of Health, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Ashraf","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Juan M Banda","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Georgia State Univeristy, Atlanta"},{"author_name":"Jaehyeong Cho","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ajou University Graduate School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Aedin C Culhane","author_inst":"Department of Data Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Biostatistics, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston"},{"author_name":"Alexander Davydov","author_inst":"Medical Ontology Solutions, Odysseus Data Services Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Frank J DeFalco","author_inst":"Janssen Research and Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs"},{"author_name":"Thomas Falconer","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain,"},{"author_name":"Weihua Gao","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US"},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Pharmacoepidemiology, Regeneron, NY"},{"author_name":"Jill Hardin","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Vojtech Huser","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hokyun Jeon","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yonghua Jing","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US,"},{"author_name":"Chi Young Jung","author_inst":"Daegu Catholic University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Denys Kaduk","author_inst":"Odysseus Data Services, Inc., MA, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Seamus Kent","author_inst":"National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK"},{"author_name":"Yeesuk Kim","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Spyros Kolovos","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Lane","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hyejin Lee","author_inst":"Bigdata Department, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service"},{"author_name":"Kristine E.

Iran was among the first countries that had to confront serious shortages in RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 and ventilators availabilities throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aimed to investigate the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with different rRT-PCR test results during the first 3 weeks of the outbreak in Qazvin province, Iran. Methods -For this retrospective cohort study, data of hospitalized patients primarily diagnosed as having COVID-19 in all 12 centers across the whole Qazvin province during Feb 20-Mar 11, 2020 was analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression model was applied to assess the independent associates of death among COVID-19 patients. Results - 998 patients (57% male, median age 54 years) with positive chest CT-scan changes were included in this study. Among them, 558 patients were examined with rRT-PCR test and 73.8% tested positive. Case fatality rate was 20.68% and 7.53% among test-positive and test negative hospitalized patients, respectively. While only 5.2% of patients were ICU admitted, case fatality rates outside ICU were 17.70% and 4.65% in test-positive and test-negative non-ICU admitted patients, correspondingly. The independent associates of death were age [&ge;] 70 years, testing positive with rRT-PCR test, having immunodeficiency disorders and ICU admission. Conclusions - Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms despite positive chest CT changes and major comorbidities were more probable to have negative rRT-PCR test result, hence lower case fatality rate and a more favorable outcome.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saeed Nemati","author_inst":"Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute of Iran, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Hamid Reza Najari","author_inst":"1.

Until now, there is no specific treatment or vaccine for this disease; WHO suggests only some protective measures like maintaining social distance, staying home, washing hands with soap or sanitizer, wearing mask etc. The objective of this study was to survey knowledge, attitude, practice and perception regarding COVID-19 among students in Rajshahi University, Bangladesh. Methods: We collected data from 305 students of Rajshahi University for this cross-sectional study using mixed sampling from March 11 to March 19, 2020. Frequency distribution, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in this study. Results: Out of 305 participants, 224 (73.4%) and 81 (26.6%) were male and female students respectively. The study revealed that Rajshahi university students had average knowledge on symptoms, protective way and transmission of COVID-19. Female students were more knowledgeable than male. More than one third of the students had negative attitude to avoiding public transport and going out to public places with friends and family. The practice of students during our data collection period and in future was not satisfactory. More than one third of students were not keen to stay at home and avoid going to crowded places. The perception towards COVID-19 was not good; they had no idea whether the outbreak would affect their daily routine, study and financial matters, study field work and restrict leisure time of meeting family and relatives. Conclusions: We found that general knowledge, attitude, practice and perception of the university students regarding COVID-19 were not satisfactory. This indicated that the situation was worse among common people. In Bangladesh, the number of healthcare providers is insufficient. University students can be employed as potential workforce to create awareness among mass people on prevention of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

We presented a modified Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Removed (SLIR) compartmental model of COVID-19 disease transmission with nonlinear incidence during the epidemic period. We provided the model calibration to estimate parameters with day wise corona virus (COVID-19) data i.e. reported cases by worldometer from the period of 15th February to 30th March, 2020 in six high burden countries including Australia, Italy, Spain, USA, UK and Canada. We estimate transmission rates for each countries and found that the highest transmission rate country in Spain, which may be increase the new cases and deaths in Spain than the other countries. Sensitivity analysis was used to identify the most important parameters through the partial rank correlation coefficient method. We found that the transmission rate of COVID-19 had the largest influence on the prevalence. We also provides the prediction of new cases in COVID-19 until May 18, 2020 using the developed model and recommends, control strategies of COVID-19. The information that we generated from this study would be useful to the decision makers of various organizations across the world including the Ministry of Health in Australia, Italy, Spain, USA, UK and Canada to control COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Azizur Rahman","author_inst":"Charles Sturt University"},{"author_name":"Md Abdul Kuddus","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Md.

Aims: To assess the knowledge and beliefs of the general public of India on COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between 20th March and 15th April 2020. A 17-item questionnaire was developed, validated, and used for the study. The questionnaire was randomly distributed among the public using Google forms through social media networks. Descriptive analysis was performed to represent the study characteristics, Chi-square test for assessing the associations among the study variables, and logistic regression analysis for identifying the factors influencing the beliefs. Results: A total of 462 participants with a mean (SD) age of 30.66 (11.31) years were responded to the questionnaire. Study participants are having fairly good knowledge of the basic aspects of COVID-19. However, a considerable fraction of participants were having false beliefs towards the transmission of new coronavirus, and prevention & treatment of COVID-19. It was observed that the participants who were aged 31-60 years and >60 years, education level of intermediate or diploma and high school certificate, and occupation as the unskilled workers had more of false beliefs towards COVID-19 compared to their counterparts. Conclusion: Though the overall knowledge on COVID-19 was good enough among the general public of India, still there is a need for education to avoid false beliefs especially among the people who are elderly, having a low level of education, and non-professional workers.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Puvvada Rahul Krishna","author_inst":"College of Science Health and Engineering, La Trobe University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Krishna Undela","author_inst":"JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Mysuru"},{"author_name":"Balaji Sathyanarayana Gupta","author_inst":"JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Mysuru"},{"author_name":"Shilpa Palaksha","author_inst":"JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Mysuru"},{"author_name":"Suhaili Mohd","author_inst":"University of Malaya"},{"author_name":"Lai Lee Lee","author_inst":"University of Malaya"},{"author_name":"Md.

Chest computed tomography (CT) scan is highly important in the diagnosis and follow-up of lung disease treatment. The present meta-analysis was performed to evaluate chest CT findings in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: All research steps were taken according to the MOOSE protocol and the final report was based on PRISMA guidelines. Each stage of the study was conducted by two independent authors. We searched the Web of Science, Ovid, Science Direct, Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed\/Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, CINAHL and Google scholar databases. The search was conducted on March 20, 2020. Grey literature was searched at medrxiv website. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. The adapted Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the risk of bias. We registered this review at PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42019127858). Results: Finally, 40 eligible studies with 4,183 patients with COVID-19 were used for meta-analysis. The rate of positive chest CT scan in patients with COVID-19 was 94.5% (95%CI: 91.7-96.3). Bilateral lung involvement, pure ground-glass opacity (GGO), mixed (GGO pulse consolidation or reticular), consolidation, reticular, and presence of nodule findings in chest CT scan of COVID-19 pneumonia patients were respectively estimated to be 79.1% (95% CI: 70.8-85.5), 64.9% (95%CI: 54.1-74.4), 49.2% (95%CI: 35.7-62.8), 30.3% (95%CI: 19.6-43.6), 17.0% (95%CI: 3.9-50.9) and 16.6% (95%CI: 13.6-20.2). The distribution of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was peripheral (70.0% [95%CI: 57.8-79.9]), central (3.9% [95%CI: 1.4-10.6]), and peripheral and central (31.1% [95%CI: 19.5-45.8]). The most common pulmonary lobes involved were right lower lobe (86.5% [95%CI: 57.7-96.8]) and left lower lobe (81.0% [95%CI: 50.5-94.7]). Conclusion: Our study showed that chest CT scan has little weakness in diagnosis of COVID-19 combined to personal history, clinical symptoms, and initial laboratory findings, and may therefore serve as a standard method for diagnosis of COVID-19 based on its features and transformation rule, before initial RT-PCR screening.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Karimian","author_inst":"Ilam University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Milad Azami","author_inst":"Ilam University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Balaji Sathyanarayana Gupta","author_inst":"JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Mysuru"},{"author_name":"Shilpa Palaksha","author_inst":"JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Mysuru"},{"author_name":"Suhaili Mohd","author_inst":"University of Malaya"},{"author_name":"Lai Lee Lee","author_inst":"University of Malaya"},{"author_name":"Md.

Sample pooling for RT-PCR has been effectively used to detect community transmission of SARS CoV-2. Nevertheless, this procedure may decrease the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays due to specimen dilution. We evaluated the efficacy of this strategy for diagnosis of Covid-19 using a sensitive commercially-available RT-PCR targeting SARS CoV-2 E and RdRp genes in a single reaction. A total of 20 mini-pools containing either 5 (n=10) or 10 (n=10) nasopharyngeal exudates collected in universal transport medium were made, each of which including a unique positive NP specimen. Positive specimens yielding CT <32 for the E gene (6 out of 10) or <35.2 for the RdRP gene (7 out of 10) were detected in mini-pools of both sizes. In contrast, most NP samples displaying CTs > 35.8 for the E gene or 35.7 for the RdRP gene remained undetected in mini-pools of 5 specimens (3\/4 and 2\/3, respectively) or in mini-pools of 10 samples (4\/4 and 3\/3, respectively.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ignacio Torres","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinical University Hospital of Valencia, Institute for Research INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Eliseo Albert","author_inst":"Microbiology Service,  Clinical University Hospital of Valencia, Institute for Research INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"David Navarro","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Shilpa Palaksha","author_inst":"JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Mysuru"},{"author_name":"Suhaili Mohd","author_inst":"University of Malaya"},{"author_name":"Lai Lee Lee","author_inst":"University of Malaya"},{"author_name":"Md.

Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods: We performed a case series of COVID-19 positive\/suspected patients admitted between 2\/1\/2020 and 4\/4\/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine or a combination. We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc [&ge;]500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc [&ge;]550 (if QRS [&ge;]120 ms) and b) increased QTc of [&ge;]60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Results: Of 490 COVID-19 positive\/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either\/both drugs, and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive, 25 suspected) met study criteria (age 62{+\/-}17 yrs, 61% male). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448{+\/-}29 ms and increased to 459{+\/-}36ms (p=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18{+\/-}43 ms vs -0.2{+\/-}28 ms in women, p=0.02). 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. In a multivariable logistic regression, age, sex, Tisdale score, Elixhauser score, and baseline QTc were not associated with critical QTc prolongation (p>0.14). Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared to either drug, with many-fold greater prolongation with the combination vs. azithromycin alone (17{+\/-}39 vs. 0.5{+\/-}40 ms, p=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions: Overall, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc interval prolongation, and traditional risk indices failed to flag these patients. With the drug combination, QTc prolongation was several-fold higher compared to azithromycin alone. The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients with these drugs should be carefully assessed prior to use.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Archana Ramireddy","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Harpriya S.

In Mexico, according to official statistics (April 18), 7,497 cases have been confirmed with 650 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 8.67%. These estimates, however, may not reflect the final fatality risk among COVID-19 confirmed patients, because they are based on cross-sectional counts of diagnosed and deceased patients, and therefore are not adjusted by time of exposure and right-censorship. In this paper we estimate fatality risks based on survival analysis methods, calculated from individual-level data on symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 recently released by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The estimated fatality risk after 35 days of onset of symptoms is 12.38% (95% CI: 11.37-13.47). Fatality risks sharply rise with age, and significantly increase for males (59%) and individuals with comorbidities (38%-168%, depending on the disease). Two reasons may explain the high COVID-19 related fatality risk observed in Mexico, despite its younger age structure: the high selectivity and self-selectivity in testing and the high prevalence of chronic-degenerative diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patricio Sol\u00eds","author_inst":"El Colegio de M\u00e9xico"},{"author_name":"Hiram Carre\u0148o","author_inst":"El Colegio de M\u00e9xico"},{"author_name":"Kyndaron Reinier","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Joseph Ebinger","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eunice Park","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Thompson","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Cingolani","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Susan Cheng","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Marban","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christine Albert","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sumeet S.

Although, the disease appears on the African continent late, it has spread to virtually all the countries. We provide early spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 within the first 62 days of the disease's appearance on the African continent. We used a two-parameter hurdle Poisson model to simultaneously analyze the zero counts and the frequency of occurrence. We investigate the effects of important healthcare capacities including hospital beds and number of medical doctors in the different countries. The results show that cases of the pandemic vary geographically across Africa with notable high incidence in neighboring countries particularly in West and North Africa. The burden of the disease (per 100,000) was most felt in Djibouti Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. Temporally, during the first 4 weeks, the burden was highest in Senegal, Egypt and Mauritania, but by mid-April it shifted to Somalia, Chad, Guinea, Tanzania, Gabon, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. Currently, Namibia, Angola, South Sudan, Burundi and Uganda have the least burden. The findings could be useful in implementing epidemiological intervention and allocation of scarce resources based on heterogeneity of the disease patterns.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ezra Gayawan","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Olawale Awe","author_inst":"Anchor University, Lagos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Bamidele M Oseni","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ikemefuna C Uzochukwu","author_inst":"Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Adeshina I Adekunle","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Gemisola Samuel","author_inst":"covenant university, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Damon Eisen","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Oyelola Adegboye","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Marban","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christine Albert","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sumeet S.

Although Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) is considered to be the gold standard, serological tests based on antibodies could be very helpful. However, individual studies measuring the accuracy of the various tests are usually underpowered and inconsistent, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines. We conducted the literature search in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. For the statistical analysis we used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA) and the point-of-care (POC) Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA) that are based on immunochromatography. In total, we identified 38 eligible studies that include data from 7,848 individuals. The analyses showed that tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests. IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones, and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, irrespective of the method, a combined IgG\/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type alone. All methods yielded high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods performed better in terms of sensitivity (90-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 86%. ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic. POC tests (LFIA), that are more attractive for large seroprevalence studies show high specificity but lower sensitivity and this should be taken into account when designing and performing seroprevalence studies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Panagiota I Kontou","author_inst":"University of Thessaly"},{"author_name":"Georgia G Braliou","author_inst":"University of Thessaly"},{"author_name":"Niki L Dimou","author_inst":"International Agency for Research on Cancer"},{"author_name":"Georgios Nikolopoulos","author_inst":"University of Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Pantelis G Bagos","author_inst":"University of Thessaly"},{"author_name":"Gemisola Samuel","author_inst":"covenant university, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Damon Eisen","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Oyelola Adegboye","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Marban","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christine Albert","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sumeet S.

We aimed to estimate the total number of COVID-19 related infections, deaths, and hospitalizations in Iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios. Methods: We developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, parameterized to the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. We used the model to quantify the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran and assess the effectiveness of isolation and physical distancing under five different scenarios (A: 0% isolation, through E: 40% isolation of all infected cases). We used Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). Findings: Under scenario A, we estimated 5,196,000 (UI 1,753,000 - 10,220,000) infections to happen till mid-June with 966,000 (UI 467,800 - 1,702,000) hospitalizations and 111,000 (UI 53,400 - 200,000) deaths. Successful implantation of scenario E would reduce the number of infections by 90% (i.e. 550,000) and change the epidemic peak from 66,000 on June 9th to 9,400 on March 1st. Scenario E also reduces the hospitalizations by 92% (i.e. 74,500), and deaths by 93% (i.e. 7,800). Interpretation: With no approved vaccination or therapy, we found physical distancing and isolation that includes public awareness and case-finding\/isolation of 40% of infected people can reduce the burden of COVID-19 in Iran by 90% by mid-June.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hamid Sharifi","author_inst":"HIV\/STI Surveillance Research Center, and WHO Collaborating Center

The total numbers of infected individuals have already crossed 2 million throughout the world. The government of all the affected countries have already taken many measures like lockdown to stop the spread. Therefore, it is important to study the nature of growth and interpretations are necessary for taking needful by the government. In this paper, we have tried to interpret the spreading capability of novel corona virus in India taking into consideration of 21 days lockdown data. The prediction is based on the present number of available cases and number of new cases reporting daily. We have explained the number of infected people in India comparing with Italy, China, Spain, and USA data of 21 days individually after announcing lockdown. The plot of daily new cases with the number of days spent after lockdown is fitted by linear and polynomial function. The best fitted graph is chosen for interpretation and that is based on the parameters obtained from fitting. The forecast of maximum spreading possibility is discussed with linear and 4-degree polynomial fitting parameters. Finally, some further preventive measurements are also discussed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Achintya Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the mutual effects of belief that the pandemic was the result of a global conspiracy on knowledge and anxiety levels among students at the University of Jordan (UJ). Methods: An electronic-based survey was conducted between March 29th 2020 and March 31st 2020. The targeted population involved all undergraduate and postgraduate students from Health, Scientific and Humanities Schools at UJ. Survey sections included 26 items on: socio-demographic information, knowledge and sources of information about the disease, attitude towards the false notion that COVID-19 stemmed from a global conspiracy and items to assess the anxiety level among students during the quarantine period. Results: The total number of participants was 1540 students. The majority of participants perceived the disease as moderately dangerous (n=1079, 70.1%), with males, Jordanians and participants with lower income being more inclined to feel that the disease is very dangerous (p<0.001, 0.020, and <0.001, respectively). Lower level of knowledge and higher level of anxiety about COVID-19 were associated with the belief that the disease is part of a global conspiracy (p<0.001 and p=0.004, respectively). Females and participants with lower income were more likely to believe that the disease is related to conspiracy (p=0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Belief in global conspiracy regarding the origin of COVID-19 was associated with misinformation about the availability of vaccine and the therapeutic use of antibiotics for COVID-19 treatment (p=0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Ministry of Health in Jordan was the most common source of information about COVID-19 reported by the participants (n=1018). Conclusions: The false belief that COVID-19 was the result of a global conspiracy could be the consequence of lower level of knowledge about the virus and could lead to higher level of anxiety, which should be considered in the awareness tools of various media platforms about the current pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malik Sallam","author_inst":"University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Deema Dababseh","author_inst":"University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Alaa' Yaseen","author_inst":"University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Ayat Al-Haidar","author_inst":"University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Nidaa A.

Several treatments are currently being tested worldwide. This paper focuses on anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, which have been currently reviewed by a systematic study as a good potential candidate and that has been reported as the most used treatment by a recent survey of physicians. We compare the dynamics of COVID-19 death rates in countries using anti-malaria drugs as a treatment from the start of the epidemic versus countries that do not, the day of the 3rd death and the following 10 days. We show that the first group have a much slower dynamic in death rates that the second group. This univariate analysis is of course only one additional piece of evidence in the debate regarding the efficiency of anti-malaria drugs, and it is also limited as the two groups certainly have other systemic differences in the way they responded to the pandemic, in the way they report death or in their population that better explain differences in dynamics (systematic differences that may also explain their choice to rely on anti-malaria drugs in the first place). Nevertheless, the difference in dynamics is so striking that we believe that the urgency context commands presenting the univariate analysis before delving into further analysis. In the end, this data might ultimately be either a piece of evidence in favor or anti-malaria drugs or a stepping stone in understanding further what other ecological aspects place a role in the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maxime Izoulet","author_inst":"EHESS"},{"author_name":"Bulut Yurtsever","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Gozde Sir","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Derya Dilek Kancagi","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sevda Demir","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Selen Abanuz","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Utku Seyis","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Mulazim Yildirim","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Recai Kuzay","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Omer Elibol","author_inst":"Acibadem Altunizade Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Serap Arbak","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Merve Acikel Elmas","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Selcuk Birdogan","author_inst":"Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Eray Sahin","author_inst":"Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Orhan Ozcan","author_inst":"Epigenetiks Genetics Bioinformatics Software Inc., Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ugur Sezerman","author_inst":"Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs"},{"author_name":"Thomas Falconer","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain,"},{"author_name":"Weihua Gao","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US"},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Pharmacoepidemiology, Regeneron, NY"},{"author_name":"Jill Hardin","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Vojtech Huser","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hokyun Jeon","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yonghua Jing","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US,"},{"author_name":"Chi Young Jung","author_inst":"Daegu Catholic University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Denys Kaduk","author_inst":"Odysseus Data Services, Inc., MA, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Seamus Kent","author_inst":"National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK"},{"author_name":"Yeesuk Kim","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Spyros Kolovos","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Lane","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hyejin Lee","author_inst":"Bigdata Department, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service"},{"author_name":"Kristine E.

With repercussions ranging from rampant mortality, fear, paranoia and economic recession, the virus has brought together countries in order to look at possible therapeutic countermeasures. With prophylactic interventions possibly months away from being particularly effective, a slew of measures and possibilities concerning the design of vaccines are being worked upon. We attempted a structure-based approach utilizing a combination of epitope prediction servers to develop a multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine that involves the two major domains of the spike glycoprotein of SARS CoV-2 (S1 and S2) coupled with a substantially effective chimeric adjuvant to create stable vaccine constructs through MD simulations. The designed constructs were evaluated based on their docking with Toll Like Receptor (TLR) 4. Our findings provide an epitope-based peptide fragment; which can be a potential candidate for the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Recent experimental studies based on determining immunodominant regions across the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 indicate the presence of the predicted epitopes included in this study.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Debarghya Mitra","author_inst":"Central University of Rajasthan"},{"author_name":"Janmejay Pandey","author_inst":"Central University of Rajasthan"},{"author_name":"Shiv Swaroop","author_inst":"Central University of Rajasthan"},{"author_name":"Derya Dilek Kancagi","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sevda Demir","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Selen Abanuz","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Utku Seyis","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Mulazim Yildirim","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Recai Kuzay","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Omer Elibol","author_inst":"Acibadem Altunizade Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Serap Arbak","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Merve Acikel Elmas","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Selcuk Birdogan","author_inst":"Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Eray Sahin","author_inst":"Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Orhan Ozcan","author_inst":"Epigenetiks Genetics Bioinformatics Software Inc., Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ugur Sezerman","author_inst":"Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs"},{"author_name":"Thomas Falconer","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain,"},{"author_name":"Weihua Gao","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US"},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Pharmacoepidemiology, Regeneron, NY"},{"author_name":"Jill Hardin","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Vojtech Huser","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hokyun Jeon","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yonghua Jing","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US,"},{"author_name":"Chi Young Jung","author_inst":"Daegu Catholic University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Denys Kaduk","author_inst":"Odysseus Data Services, Inc., MA, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Seamus Kent","author_inst":"National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK"},{"author_name":"Yeesuk Kim","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Spyros Kolovos","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Lane","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hyejin Lee","author_inst":"Bigdata Department, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service"},{"author_name":"Kristine E.

Yet some countries avoided lockdowns and focused on other strategies, like contact tracing and case isolation. How effective and cost-effective are these strategies? We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on pandemic control, with a focus on cost-effectiveness. Methods: Following PRISMA systematic review guidelines, MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2, 2020) and Embase (1974 to April 17, 2020) were searched using a range of terms related to pandemic control. Articles reporting on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of at least one intervention were included and grouped into higher-quality evidence (randomized trials) and lower-quality evidence (other study designs). Results: We found 1,653 papers; 62 were included. Higher-quality evidence was only available to support the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks. Modelling studies indicated that these measures are highly cost-effective. For other interventions, lower-quality evidence suggested that: (1) the most cost-effective interventions are swift contact tracing and case isolation, surveillance networks, protective equipment for healthcare workers, and early vaccination (when available); (2) home quarantines and stockpiling antivirals are less cost-effective; (3) social distancing measures like workplace and school closures are effective but costly, making them the least cost-effective options; (4) combinations are more cost-effective than single interventions; (5) interventions are more cost-effective when adopted early and for severe viruses like SARS-CoV-2. For H1N1 influenza, contact tracing was estimated to be 4,363 times more cost-effective than school closures ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented). Conclusions: A cautious interpretation of the evidence suggests that for COVID-19: (1) social distancing is effective but costly, especially when adopted late and (2) adopting as early as possible a combination of interventions that includes hand washing, face masks, ample protective equipment for healthcare workers, and swift contact tracing and case isolation is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carl-Etienne Juneau","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Tomas Pueyo","author_inst":"Independent Contributor"},{"author_name":"Matt Bell","author_inst":"Independent Contributor"},{"author_name":"Genevieve Gee","author_inst":"Independent Contributor"},{"author_name":"Pablo Collazzo","author_inst":"Danube University"},{"author_name":"Louise Potvin","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Utku Seyis","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Mulazim Yildirim","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Recai Kuzay","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Omer Elibol","author_inst":"Acibadem Altunizade Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Serap Arbak","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Merve Acikel Elmas","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Selcuk Birdogan","author_inst":"Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Eray Sahin","author_inst":"Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Orhan Ozcan","author_inst":"Epigenetiks Genetics Bioinformatics Software Inc., Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ugur Sezerman","author_inst":"Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs"},{"author_name":"Thomas Falconer","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain,"},{"author_name":"Weihua Gao","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US"},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Pharmacoepidemiology, Regeneron, NY"},{"author_name":"Jill Hardin","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Vojtech Huser","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hokyun Jeon","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yonghua Jing","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US,"},{"author_name":"Chi Young Jung","author_inst":"Daegu Catholic University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Denys Kaduk","author_inst":"Odysseus Data Services, Inc., MA, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Seamus Kent","author_inst":"National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK"},{"author_name":"Yeesuk Kim","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Spyros Kolovos","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Lane","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hyejin Lee","author_inst":"Bigdata Department, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service"},{"author_name":"Kristine E.

In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (infection from which results in the disease named COVID-19) was reported, and, due to the rapid spread of the virus in other parts of the world, the World Health Organization declared a state of emergency. In this paper, we used automated extraction of COVID-19-related discussions from social media and a natural language process (NLP) method based on topic modeling to uncover various issues related to COVID-19 from public opinions. Moreover, we also investigate how to use LSTM recurrent neural network for sentiment classification of COVID-19 comments. Our findings shed light on the importance of using public opinions and suitable computational techniques to understand issues surrounding COVID-19 and to guide related decision-making.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hamed Jelodar","author_inst":"Nanjing University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yongli Wang","author_inst":"Nanjing University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Rita Orji","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Hucheng Huang","author_inst":"Jiangsu University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Pablo Collazzo","author_inst":"Danube University"},{"author_name":"Louise Potvin","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Utku Seyis","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Mulazim Yildirim","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Recai Kuzay","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Omer Elibol","author_inst":"Acibadem Altunizade Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Serap Arbak","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Merve Acikel Elmas","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Selcuk Birdogan","author_inst":"Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Eray Sahin","author_inst":"Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Orhan Ozcan","author_inst":"Epigenetiks Genetics Bioinformatics Software Inc., Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ugur Sezerman","author_inst":"Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs"},{"author_name":"Thomas Falconer","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain,"},{"author_name":"Weihua Gao","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US"},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Pharmacoepidemiology, Regeneron, NY"},{"author_name":"Jill Hardin","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Vojtech Huser","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hokyun Jeon","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yonghua Jing","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US,"},{"author_name":"Chi Young Jung","author_inst":"Daegu Catholic University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Denys Kaduk","author_inst":"Odysseus Data Services, Inc., MA, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Seamus Kent","author_inst":"National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK"},{"author_name":"Yeesuk Kim","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Spyros Kolovos","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Lane","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hyejin Lee","author_inst":"Bigdata Department, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service"},{"author_name":"Kristine E.

Methods: Eleven of 1453 patients with a probable diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively selected for the presence of PE. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded. All cross-sectional CT imaging was qualitatively scored for the first 28 days after onset of symptoms. Results: Of 24 patients underwent CTA-PE, 11 were confirmed with PE. All 11 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We observed an evolution pattern of predominant findings with ground-glass opacities (GGO) to GGO with crazy paving in 3 patients, then to consolidation with linear densities, or to reticulation in 9 patients. Lung cysts or traction bronchiectasis could be seen from day 5 to 9 after symptoms and reticulation, subpleural curvilinear lines were more common from day 20. The pulmonary opacities were predominantly peripheral in distribution with relative sparing of nondependent lungs. The severity of lung involvement was high with an average score of 9.7 in the first phase, 18 in the second phase plateauing in the next two phases, with a slight decrease to 16.9 in the late phase. The pulmonary emboli were most common in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Conclusion: The incidence of PE among suspected patients in COVID-19 was high. Our study suggests PE may occur with increased frequency in the ARDS subgroup. The evolution of radiographic abnormalities showed a general pattern, but are also unique with more extensive lung injury and specific imaging features.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Li","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huzhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Gregory Kicska","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Paul E Kinahan","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chengcheng Zhu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Murat Alp Oztek","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Wei Wu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Utku Seyis","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Mulazim Yildirim","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Recai Kuzay","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Omer Elibol","author_inst":"Acibadem Altunizade Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Serap Arbak","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Merve Acikel Elmas","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Selcuk Birdogan","author_inst":"Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Eray Sahin","author_inst":"Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Orhan Ozcan","author_inst":"Epigenetiks Genetics Bioinformatics Software Inc., Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ugur Sezerman","author_inst":"Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs"},{"author_name":"Thomas Falconer","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain,"},{"author_name":"Weihua Gao","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US"},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Pharmacoepidemiology, Regeneron, NY"},{"author_name":"Jill Hardin","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Vojtech Huser","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hokyun Jeon","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yonghua Jing","author_inst":"Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, North Chicago, US,"},{"author_name":"Chi Young Jung","author_inst":"Daegu Catholic University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Denys Kaduk","author_inst":"Odysseus Data Services, Inc., MA, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Seamus Kent","author_inst":"National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK"},{"author_name":"Yeesuk Kim","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Spyros Kolovos","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Lane","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hyejin Lee","author_inst":"Bigdata Department, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service"},{"author_name":"Kristine E.

At cellular level, virus infection initiates with binding of viral particles to the host surface cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. Understanding how TMPRSS2 protein expression in the lung varies in the population could reveal important insights into differential susceptibility to influenza and coronavirus infections. Here, we systematically analyzed coding-region variants in TMPRSS2 and the eQTL variants, which may affect the gene expression, to compare the genomic characteristics of TMPRSS2 among different populations. Our findings suggest that the lung-specific eQTL variants may confer different susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions. In particular, we found that the eQTL variant rs35074065 is associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression of the interferon (IFN)-\/{beta}-inducible gene, MX1, splicing isoform. Thus, these subjects could account for a more susceptibility either to viral infection or to a decrease in cellular antiviral response.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberta Russo","author_inst":"Dip.
