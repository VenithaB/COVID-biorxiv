The outbreak of COVID-19 has been defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, and containment depends on traditional public health measures. However, the explosive growth of the number of infected cases in a short period of time has caused tremendous pressure on medical systems. Adequate isolation facilities are essential to control outbreaks, so this study aims to quickly estimate the demand and number of isolation beds. Methods. We established a discrete simulation model for epidemiology. By adjusting or fitting necessary epidemic parameters, the effects of the following indicators on the development of the epidemic and the occupation of medical resources were explained: (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease cure time, and (4) population mobility. Finally, a method for predicting the reasonable number of isolation beds was summarized through multiple linear regression. Results. Through simulation, we show that the incubation period, response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, disease cure time, degree of population mobility, and infectivity of cured patients have different effects on the infectivity, scale, and duration of the epidemic. Among them, (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease cure time, and (4) population mobility have a significant impact on the demand and number of isolation beds (P <0.05), which agrees with the following regression equation: N = P * (-0.273 + 0.009I +0.234M + 0.012T1 + 0.015T2) * (1+V).","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinyu Li","author_inst":"Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Center of Stomatology, Xiangya Hospital,  Central South University,"},{"author_name":"Yufeng Cai","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University,  Changsha, Hunan"},{"author_name":"Yinghe Ding","author_inst":"Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jia-da Li","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Huang","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Ye Liang","author_inst":"Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Center of Stomatology, Xiangya Hospital,  Central South University,"},{"author_name":"Linyong Xu","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20152298","rel_title":"The effect of international travel restrictions on internal spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20152298","rel_abs":"Background: Countries have restricted international arrivals to delay the spread of COVID-19. These measures carry a high economic and social cost. They may have little impact on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared to imported cases. Methods: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we compared the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to the expected COVID-19 cases arising from internal spread on an average day in May 2020 in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. Findings: With May 2019 travel volumes, imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 103 (95% credible interval: 76 - 130) out of 142 countries, and <1% in 48 (95% CrI: 9 - 95). If we assume that travel would decrease compared to May 2019 even in the absence of formal restrictions, then imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 109-123 countries and <1% in 61-88 countries (depending on the assumptions about travel reductions). Interpretation: While countries can expect infected travellers to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions, in most countries these imported cases likely contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions may have limited impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy W.

It further calculates the levels of immunity required for these selfsame lockdown regimes to begin to work, then predicts their perceived values, should infections have been underestimated by a factor of 10. The first, level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious, SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on a limited knowledge. Its basic reproduction number (r0 = 1.93) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than unity. Obviously, it could be anticipated that the same would apply for subsequent, lower levels of lockdown. The basic reproduction number for the level-3 lockdown was found to be 2.34 and that of the level-4 lockdown, 1.69. The suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been marginally 'smarter' than the 'harder', level-5 lockdown, although its basic reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new normal, or the ever-present error associated with data sets, in general. The pandemic's basic reproduction number was calculated to be 3.16, in the Swedish context. The lockdowns therefore served to ensure that the medical system was not overwhelmed, bought it valuable time to prepare and provided useful data. The lockdowns nonetheless failed significantly in meeting any objective to curtail the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon John Childs","author_inst":"University of Fort Hare"},{"author_name":"Joesph Wu","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Samuel Clifford","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Linyong Xu","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20100941","rel_title":"Covid-19 and dysregulated cerebral perfusion: observations with multimodal MRI","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20100941","rel_abs":"The pathogenesis of encephalopathy-associated Covid-19 is still unclear.

We analysed the performance of National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Adult non-elective admissions discharged between 11-March-2020 to 13-June-2020 with an index NEWS2 electronically recorded within 24 hours of admission are used to predict mortality at four time points (in-hospital, 24hours, 48hours, and 72hours) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 admissions. Results: Out of 6480 non-elective admissions, 620 (9.6%) had a diagnosis of COVID-19. They were older (73.3 vs 67.7yrs), more often male (54.7% vs 50.1%), had higher index NEWS (4 vs 2.5) and NEWS2 (4.6 vs 2.8) scores and higher in-hospital mortality (32.1% vs 5.8%). The c-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 admissions was significantly lower using NEWS (0.64 vs 0.74) or NEWS2 (0.64 vs 0.74), however these differences reduced at 72hours (NEWS: 0.75 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.71 vs 0.81), 48 hours (NEWS: 0.78 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.76 vs 0.82) and 24hours (NEWS: 0.84 vs 0.84; NEWS2: 0.86 vs 0.84). Increasing NEWS2 values reflected increased mortality, but for any given value the absolute risk was on average 24% higher (e.g.NEWS2=5: 36% vs 9%). Interpretation: NEWS2 is a valid predictor of the mortality risk but substantially underestimates the absolute mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey with 1,912 Chinese university students was conducted during March and April 2020. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with willingness to participate. Results: The majority of participants (64.01%) indicated willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Hesitancy over signing informed consent documents, concerns over time necessary for participating in a medical study, and perceived COVID-19 societal stigma were identified as deterrents, whereas lower socioeconomic status, female gender, perception of likely COVID-19 infection during the pandemic, and COVID-19 prosocial behaviors were facilitative factors. Further, public health mistrust and hesitancy over signing informed consent documents had a significant interactive effect on vaccine trial willingness. Conclusions: High standards of ethical and scientific practice are needed in COVID-19 vaccine research, including providing potential participants full and accurate information and ensuring participation free of coercion, socioeconomic inequality, and stigma. Attending to the needs of marginalized groups and addressing psychosocial factors including stigma and public health mistrust may also be important to COVID-19 vaccine development and future uptake.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shufang Sun","author_inst":"Brown University Alpert Medical School"},{"author_name":"Danhua Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Don Operario","author_inst":"Brown University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Feng Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ziyong Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xionglin Fan","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"theresa Israel","author_inst":"Service de Radiologie, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Bichat-Claude Bernard, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Agathe Raynaud-Simon","author_inst":"Service de Geriatrie, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Bichat-Claude Bernard, Paris, France, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Raphael Borie","author_inst":"Hopital Bichat"},{"author_name":"Pierre Amarenco","author_inst":"Service de Neurologie et des Accidents Vasculaires Cerebraux, APHP Nord, Hopital Bichat-Claude Bernard.INSERM Laboratory for Vascular Translational Science-Unit"},{"author_name":"Antoine Khalil","author_inst":"APHP Nord, Inserm UMR1152, Physiopathology and Epidemiology of Respiratory Diseases, Diderot Paris University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20152272","rel_title":"Effect of statins on SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20152272","rel_abs":"The retrospective analysis of clinical data of patients suffering from COVID-19 has indicated that statin therapy, used to lower plasma cholesterol levels, is associated with a better clinical outcome.

Using linked patient-level data, we set out to describe the associations between age, gender, and comorbidities and the risk of outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation, and\/or related mortality. Methods A population-based cohort study including all individuals registered in Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP). SIDIAP includes primary care records covering > 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain, and was linked to region-wide testing, hospital and mortality records. Outpatient diagnoses of COVID-19, hospitalisations with COVID-19, and deaths with COVID-19 were identified between 1st March and 6th May 2020. A multi-state model was used, with cause-specific Cox survival models estimated for each transition. Findings A total of 5,664,652 individuals were included. Of these, 109,367 had an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, 18,019 were hospitalised with COVID-19, and 5,585 died after either being diagnosed or hospitalised with COVID-19. Half of those who died were not admitted to hospital prior to their death. Risk of a diagnosis with COVID-19 peaked first in middle-age and then again for oldest ages, risk for hospitalisation after diagnosis peaked around 70 years old, with all other risks highest at oldest ages. Male gender was associated with an increased risk for all outcomes other than outpatient diagnosis. The comorbidities studied (autoimmune condition, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, malignant neoplasm, obesity, and type 2 diabetes) were all associated with worse outcomes. Interpretation There is a continued need to protect those at high risk of poor outcomes, particularly the elderly, from COVID-19 and provide appropriate care for those who develop symptomatic disease. While risks of hospitalisation and death are lower for younger populations, there is a need to limit their role in community transmission. These findings should inform public health strategies, including future vaccination campaigns.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain, 2) Centre for Statistics in M"},{"author_name":"Cristian Tebe","author_inst":"1) Biostatistics Unit at Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Spain, 2) Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Martina Recalde","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain, 2) Universitat Autonoma de Ba"},{"author_name":"Elena Roel","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"1) Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Prieto-Alhambra","author_inst":"1) Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nina G\u00f6decke","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rg Martens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Hannah Kleine-Weber","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Markus Hoffmann","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Anne Cossmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Yilmaz","author_inst":"Public Health Department"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Pink","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Marius M Hoeper","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Georg MN Behrens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefan P\u00f6hlmann","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Rainer Blasczyk","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thomas F Schulz","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Reinhold F\u00f6rster","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.20147900","rel_title":"Empirical non-linear modeling & forecast of global daily deaths of COVID-19 pandemic & evidence that a third wave is beginning to decay","rel_date":"2020-07-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.20147900","rel_abs":"Objectives: The present COVID-19 pandemic (C19P) is challenging our socities all over the world. In this work, based on massive health information daily updated, the C19P daily death numbers at a global level, are modelled, analyzed and forecasted.\n\nMethods: Two empirical models are proposed to explain daily death (DD) records: a) self-similar (SS) recurrences of the global responses, and b) geometric averaging of two independent SS models for global DD records.\n\nFindings: The detected self-similar recurrences in the global response suggest three global self-similar waves that support multi-month forecasts of the DD numbers. However, there are upper and lower-limit SS forecast DD scenarios that were jointly integrated with a geometrical average (GA) model, that support the existence of a moderated third wave, with a decaying stage for the next months (July-September 2020). It appears that the third world (South America [SAM]+Asia [ASI] +Africa [AFR]), is the actual big player, (following China, and Europe [EUR]+North America [NAM]) with its biggest contribution to a global third wave (W3) of C19P.\n\nConclusion: The empirical global modeling of the C19P has suggested us a possible moderated W3 scenario, with contributions mainly coming from the third world people. This moderated W3 scenario, after to be calibrated with the last weeks, has provided to stakeholders of significant data and criteria to define, sustain and support plans for the next months, based on data and self-similarities. These scenarios provide a well-based perspective on non-linear dynamics of C19P, that will complement the standard health and economic models.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Sanchez-Sesma","author_inst":"Independent researcher and consultant"},{"author_name":"Cristian Tebe","author_inst":"1) Biostatistics Unit at Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Spain, 2) Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Martina Recalde","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain, 2) Universitat Autonoma de Ba"},{"author_name":"Elena Roel","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"1) Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Prieto-Alhambra","author_inst":"1) Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nina G\u00f6decke","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rg Martens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Hannah Kleine-Weber","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Markus Hoffmann","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Anne Cossmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Yilmaz","author_inst":"Public Health Department"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Pink","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Marius M Hoeper","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Georg MN Behrens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefan P\u00f6hlmann","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Rainer Blasczyk","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thomas F Schulz","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Reinhold F\u00f6rster","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.199588","rel_title":"Cold sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain","rel_date":"2020-07-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.199588","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, a primary target for COVID-19 vaccine development, presents two conformations of its Receptor Binding Domain - a receptor-accessible \"up\" conformation, or a receptor-inaccessible \"down\" conformation.

This pandemic overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping, with over 1 billion smokers and vapers worldwide. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping\/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping, specifically use of flavored or nicotine-containing e-cigs, may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to the disease. Further scientific and public health investigations should be undertaken to address these concerning links between COVID-19 and e-cig\/smoking.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abby C.

PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) binding molecules. In vivo, their predominant net effect is one of systemic glucocorticoid antagonism, but they also show direct downregulation of AR and minor GR agonism at the cellular level. We hypothesize that anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity depends in part on this AR downregulation through diminished TMPRSS2 expression and modulation of ACE2 activity.

Some but not all patients showed full functional recovery after the devastating lung damage, and so far there is little knowledge about the lung repair process1. Here by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we found that in severe (or critical) cases, there is remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier re-establishment, respectively. In order to understand the function of KRT5+ progenitors in vivo, we transplanted a single KRT5+ cell-derived cell population into damaged mouse lung. Time-course single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that the transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engrafted into host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell infiltration. Similar barrier cells were also identified in some COVID-19 patients with massive leukocyte infiltration. Altogether this work uncovered the mechanism that how various lung progenitor cells work in concert to prevent and replenish alveoli loss post severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Zuo","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Zixian Zhao","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhao","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Yueqing Zhou","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofan Wang","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Ting Zhang","author_inst":"Regend Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Sujit S.

Here we demonstrate the successful identification of compounds that display efficacy in blocking SARS-CoV-2 replication based on their ability to counteract the virus-induced transcriptional landscape. These compounds were found to potently reduce viral load despite having no impact on viral entry or modulation of the host antiviral response in the absence of virus. RNA-Seq profiling implicated the induction of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as the underlying mechanism of inhibition and suggested that targeting this aspect of host biology may significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daisy A.

The 5 region of their genomes was mostly recombinant free, and a phylogeny calculated from this region confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is closer to RmYN02 than RaTG13, and showed that SARS-CoV-2 diverged from RmYN02 at least 26 years ago, and both diverged from RaTG13 at least 37 years ago; recombinant regions specific to these three viruses provided no additional information as they matched no other Genbank sequences closely. Simple pairwise comparisons of genomes show that there are three regions where most non-synonymous changes probably occurred; the DUF3655 region of the nsp3, the S gene and ORF 8 gene. Differences in the last two of those regions have probably resulted from recombinational changes, however differences in the DUF3655 region may have resulted from selection. A hexamer of the proteins encoded by the nsp3 region may form the molecular pore spanning the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle (Wolff et al., 2020), and perhaps the acidic polypeptide encoded by DUF3655 lines it, and presents a novel target for pharmaceutical intervention.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez-Rom\u00e1n","author_inst":"Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas"},{"author_name":"Adrian J Gibbs","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Rasmus Moeller","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yuling Han","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Liuliu Yang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Megan L.

This marks a unique opportunity to analyze virus spreading and evolution in a worldwide context. However, currently, there is not a useful haplotype description to help to track important and globally scattered mutations. Also, differences in the number of sequenced genomes between countries and\/or months make it difficult to identify the emergence of haplotypes in regions where few genomes are sequenced but a large number of cases are reported. We proposed an approach based on the normalization by COVID-19 cases of relative frequencies of mutations using all the available data to identify major haplotypes. Thus, we can use a similar normalization approach to tracking the global temporal and geographic haplotypes distribution in the world. Using 48 776 genomes, we identify 5 major haplotypes based on 9 high-frequency mutations. Normalized global geographic and temporal analysis is presented here highlighting the current importance of nucleocapsid mutations (R203K, G204R) above the highly discussed D614G in spike protein. Also, we analyzed age, gender, and patient status distribution by haplotypes, but scarce and not well-organized information about this is publicly available. For that, we create a web-service to continuously update our normalized analysis of mutations and haplotypes, and to allow researchers to voluntarily share patient status information in a well-organized manner to improve analyses and making possible monitor the emergence of mutations and\/or haplotypes with patients preferences or different pathogenic features. Finally, we discuss currently structural and functional hypotheses in the most frequently identified mutations.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santiago Justo Arevalo","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma, Universidad de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Daniela Zapata Sifuentes","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Cesar Huallpa Robles","author_inst":"Universidad Agraria La Molina"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Landa Bianchi","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Adriana Castillo Chavez","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Romina Garavito-Salini Casas","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Uceda-Campos","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo"},{"author_name":"Roberto Pineda Chavarria","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Christian Stevens","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shuibing Chen","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R. tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rene Jonkers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Mads Larsen","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Federica Linty","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Anette Neele","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jan Nouta","author_inst":"LUMC, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Frank van Baarle","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Cornelis van Drunen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alexander Vlaar","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Lisa Willemsen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Manfred Wuhrer","author_inst":"LUMC, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Harm Jan Bogaard","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Menno P.J. de Winther","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry, Experimental Vascular Biology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jeroen den Dunnen","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.199562","rel_title":"Identifying Key Determinants of SARS-CoV-2\/ACE2 Tight Interaction","rel_date":"2020-07-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.199562","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of Covid-19, has fired up a global pandemic. The virus interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for invasion via receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike protein. To provide a deeper understanding of this interaction, we performed microsecond simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex for SARS- CoV-2 and compared it with the closely related SARS-CoV discovered in 2003. We show residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that were mutated from SARS-CoV, collectively help make RBD anchor much stronger to the N-terminal part of ACE2 than the corresponding residues on RBD of SARS-CoV. This would result in reduced dissociation rate of SARS-CoV-2 from human recep- tor protein compared to SARS-CoV. This phenomenon was consistently observed in simulations beyond 500 ns and was reproducible across different force fields. Altogether, our study shed light on the key residues and their dynamics at the virus spike and human receptor binding interface and advance our knowledge for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics to combat the pandemic efficiently.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Van A Ngo","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ramesh K Jha","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Cesar Huallpa Robles","author_inst":"Universidad Agraria La Molina"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Landa Bianchi","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Adriana Castillo Chavez","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Romina Garavito-Salini Casas","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Uceda-Campos","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo"},{"author_name":"Roberto Pineda Chavarria","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Christian Stevens","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shuibing Chen","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R. tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rene Jonkers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Mads Larsen","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Federica Linty","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Anette Neele","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jan Nouta","author_inst":"LUMC, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Frank van Baarle","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Cornelis van Drunen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alexander Vlaar","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Lisa Willemsen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Manfred Wuhrer","author_inst":"LUMC, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Harm Jan Bogaard","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Menno P.J. de Winther","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry, Experimental Vascular Biology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jeroen den Dunnen","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.199059","rel_title":"Tafenoquine inhibits replication of SARS-Cov-2 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations in vitro","rel_date":"2020-07-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.199059","rel_abs":"Tafenoquine [TQ] exhibited EC50\/90s of ~ 2.6\/5.1 M against SARS-CoV-2 in VERO E6 cells and was 4-fold more potent than hydroxychloroquine [HCQ].

We are using a recent protein flexibility modelling approach, combining protein structural rigidity with possible motion consistent with chemical bonds and sterics. For example, for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the open configuration, our method identifies a possible further opening and closing of the S1 subunit through movement of SB domain. With full structural information of this process available, docking studies with possible drug structures are then possible in silico.

We obtained 47 full genomes of SARS-CoV-2 which clustered into six lineages (Pangolin lineages-A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.4, and B.6). The lineages in Karnataka were known to be circulating in China, Southeast Asia, Iran, Europe and other parts of India and are likely to have been imported into the state both by international and domestic travel. Our sequences grouped into 12 contact clusters and 11 cases with no known contacts. We found nine of the 12 contact clusters had a single lineage of the virus, consistent with multiple introductions and most (8\/12) were contained within a single district, reflecting local spread. In most of the twelve clusters, the index case (9\/12) and spreaders (8\/12) were symptomatic. Of the 47 sequences, 31 belonged to the B\/B.6 lineage, including seven of eleven cases with no known contact, indicating ongoing transmission of this lineage in the state. Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka suggests multiple introductions of the virus followed by local transmission in parallel with ongoing viral evolution.

Types of coronaviruses and publication status have no significant effect on diagnosis performance. Existing nucleic acid POCTs, particularly RT-LAMP, CRISPR diagnosis and SAMBA-II, have good diagnostic performance. Future work should focus on improving a study design to minimize the risk of biases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pakpoom Subsoontorn","author_inst":"Naresuan University"},{"author_name":"Manupat Lohitnavy","author_inst":"Naresuan University"},{"author_name":"Chuenjid Kongkaew","author_inst":"Naresuan University"},{"author_name":"Daniela de Angelis","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Zhengji Chen","author_inst":"Kunming medical university"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Kunming medical University"},{"author_name":"Tina Damodar","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Nakka Vijay Kiran Reddy","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Kiran Hosallimath","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Anson K George","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Banerjee John","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Amrita Pattanaik","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Narendra Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Reeta S Mani","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Manjunatha M Venkataswamy","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Shafeeq K Shahul Hameed","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Prakash Kumar B.G.","author_inst":"Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, Bangalore, - 560012"},{"author_name":"Anita Desai","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Ravi Vasanthapuram","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Alexander Vlaar","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Lisa Willemsen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Manfred Wuhrer","author_inst":"LUMC, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Harm Jan Bogaard","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Menno P.J. de Winther","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry, Experimental Vascular Biology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jeroen den Dunnen","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150375","rel_title":"Poor correlation between antibody titers and neutralizing activity in sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150375","rel_abs":"Plenty of serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed so far, thus documenting the importance of evaluating the relevant features of the immune response to this viral agent.

SARS-CoV-2 virus has circulated in hospitals, care homes and the community since January 2020. Our current epidemiological knowledge is largely informed by clinical cases with far less understanding of community transmission. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study is a nationally representative prevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 virus swab-positivity in the community in England. We recruited participants regardless of symptom status. Results We found 159 positives from 120,610 swabs giving an average prevalence of 0.13% (95% CI: 0.11%,0.15%) from 1st May to 1st June 2020. We showed decreasing prevalence with a halving time of 8.6 (6.2, 13.6) days, implying an overall reproduction number R of 0.57 (0.45, 0.72). Adults aged 18 to 24 yrs had the highest swab-positivity rates, while those >64 yrs had the lowest. Of the 126 participants who tested positive with known symptom status in the week prior to their swab, 39 reported symptoms while 87 did not, giving an estimate that 69% (61%,76%) of people were symptom-free for the 7 days prior testing positive in our community sample. Symptoms strongly associated with swab-positivity were: nausea and\/or vomiting, diarrhoea, blocked nose, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and severe fatigue. Recent contact with a known COVID-19 case was associated with odds of 24 (16, 38) for swab-positivity. Compared with non-key workers, odds of swab-positivity were 7.7 (2.4, 25) among care home (long-term care facilities) workers and 5.2 (2.9, 9.3) among health care workers. However, some of the excess risk associated with key worker status was explained by recent contact with COVID-19 cases. We found no strong evidence for geographical variability in positive swab results. Conclusion Our results provide a reliable baseline against which the impact of subsequent relaxation of lockdown can be assessed to inform future public health efforts to control transmission.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Kylie E.

Design: Prospective evaluation of initial three weeks of a daily Monday to Friday pilot SARS-CoV-2 serology service for patients. Setting: Early post 'first-wave' SARS-CoV-2 transmission period at single centre London teaching hospital that provides care to the local community, as well as regional and national referral pathways for specialist services. Participants: 110 (72 adults, 38 children, age range 0-83 years, 52.7% female (n=58)). Interventions: Patient serum from vetted referrals tested on CE marked and internally validated lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (SureScreen Diagnostics) detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, with result and clinical interpretation provided to the direct care team. Main outcome measures: Performance characteristics, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly the benefit for clinical decision-making. Results: The LFIA was deemed suitable for clinical advice and decision making following evaluation with 310 serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients and 300 pre-pandemic samples, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 96.1% and 99.3% respectively. For the pilot, 115 referrals were received leading to 113 tests performed on 108 participants (sample not available for two participants); paediatrics (n=35), medicine (n=69), surgery (n=2) and general practice (n=2). 43.4% participants (n=49) had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. There were three main indications for serology; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 infection e.g. PIMS-TS (n=26) and pulmonary embolism (n=5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent compatible illness (n=40), and making infection control and immunosuppression treatment decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n=6). Conclusions: This study shows acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of a SARS-CoV-2 serology service using a rapid, inexpensive and portable assay for adults and children presenting with a range of clinical indications. Results correlated closely with a confirmatory in-house ELISA. The study showed the benefit of introducing a serology service where there is a reasonable pre-test probability, and the result can be linked with clinical advice or intervention. Experience thus far is that the volume of requests from hospital referral routes are manageable within existing clinical and laboratory services; however, the demand from community referrals has not yet been assessed. Given recent evidence for a rapid decline in antibodies, particularly following mild infection, there is likely a limited window of opportunity to realise the benefit of serology testing for individuals infected during the 'first-wave' before they potentially fall below a measurable threshold. Rapidly expanding availability of serology services for NHS patients will also help understand the long-term implications of serostatus and prior infection in different patient groups, particularly before emergence of any 'second-wave' outbreak or introduction of a vaccination programme.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Sweeney","author_inst":"Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Blair Merrick","author_inst":"Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Pickering","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rui Pedro Galao","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alina Botgros","author_inst":"Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Harry D.

Aim of this study is to assess the excess mortality (EM) during COVID-19 outbreak in highly impacted areas of northern Italy. Methods: We analyzed data on deaths occurred in the first four months of 2020 in health protection agencies (HPA) of Bergamo and Brescia (Lombardy), building a time-series of daily number of deaths and predicting the daily standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and cumulative number of excess deaths (ED) through a Poisson generalized additive model of the observed counts in 2020, using 2019 data as a reference. Results: We estimated 5740 (95% Credible Set (CS): 5552-5936) ED in the HPA of Bergamo and 3703 (95% CS: 3535 - 3877) in Brescia, corresponding to 2.55 (95% CS: 2.50-2.61) and 1.93 (95% CS: 1.89-1.98) folds increase in the number of deaths. The ED wave started a few days later in Brescia, but the daily estimated SMR peaked at the end of March in both HPAs, roughly two weeks after the introduction of lock-down measures, with significantly higher estimates in Bergamo (9.4, 95% CI: 9.1-9.7). Conclusion: EM was significantly larger than that officially attributed to COVID-19, disclosing its hidden burden likely due to indirect effects on health system. Time-series analyses highlighted the impact of lockdown restrictions, with a lower EM in the HPA where there was a smaller delay between the epidemic outbreak and their enforcement.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara Conti","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pietro Ferrara","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giampiero Mazzaglia","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco I D'Orso","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberta Ciampichini","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Carla Fornari","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Madotto","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Magoni","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Sampietro","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Andrea Silenzi","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Claudio V Sileo","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Zucchi","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Cesana","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo G Mantovani","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stuart J.
