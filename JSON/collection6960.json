By February 4, 2020, the government of Singapore restricted the mobility of the vulnerable age-groups. In the current study, we study the influence of the age-based vulnerability of the population with respect to COVID-19 conditions on the recovery of COVID-19 patients. We study 245 patients in Singapore recovered and discharged during January 23--April 01. We first study the descriptive statistics of the length of in-hospital stay (LOS) of the COVID-19 patients based on demographic variables, namely age, and gender. Then, we determine the distribution of LOS, using local and generalized linear regression models. We take the approach of periodization based on critical changes in the disease transmission model. Even though the overall recovery rate has reduced drastically after a sudden spike in daily confirmations, our analysis shows that there is a considerable shift in the COVID-19 confirmations to the population in the non-vulnerable age-groups. We show that the LOS of the non-vulnerable age group is considerably lower at 9 days, as opposed to 15 or 20 days in the existing literature.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaya Sreevalsan-Nair","author_inst":"International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, Karnataka, India"},{"author_name":"Reddy Rani Vangimalla","author_inst":"International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, Karnataka, India"},{"author_name":"Pritesh Rajesh Ghogale","author_inst":"International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, Karnataka, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20069666","rel_title":"Predicting the epidemic curve of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) using artificial intelligence","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20069666","rel_abs":"Objectives: The current form of severe acute respiratory syndrome called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) caused by a coronavirus (SARSCoV2) is a major global health problem. The aim of our study was to use the official data and predict the possible outcomes of the COVID 19 pandemic using artificial intelligence (AI) based RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), then compare and validate the predicted and observed data. Materials and Methods: We used the publicly available datasets of World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University to create the training dataset, then have used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with gated recurring units (Long Short Term Memory: LSTM units) to create 2 Prediction Models. Information collected in the first t time steps were aggregated with a fully connected (dense) neural network layer and a consequent regression output layer to determine the next predicted value. We used root mean squared logarithmic errors (RMSLE) to compare the predicted and observed data, then recalculated the predictions again. Results: The result of our study underscores that the COVID19 pandemic is probably a propagated source epidemic, therefore repeated peaks on the epidemic curve (rise of the daily number of the newly diagnosed infections) are to be anticipated. The errors between the predicted and validated data and trends seems to be low. Conclusions: The influence of this pandemic is great worldwide, impact our everyday lifes. Especially decision makers must be aware, that even if strict public health measures are executed and sustained, future peaks of infections are possible. The AI based predictions might be useful tools for predictions and the models can be recalculated according to the new observed data, to get more precise forecast of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laszlo Robert Kolozsvari","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Tamas Berczes","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Andras Hajdu","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Rudolf Gesztelyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Attila TIba","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Imre Varga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20069278","rel_title":"Coronametrics: The UK turns the corner","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20069278","rel_abs":"There are many ways of analyzing the progress of an epidemic, but when it comes to short term forecasting, it is very hard to beat a simple time series regression model.

In order to tackle the crisis effectively we need to know the trajectories of number of the people infected (i.e. confirmed cases). Such information is crucial to government agencies for developing effective preparedness plans and strategies. We used a statistical modeling approach (extreme value distributions, EVDs) for projecting the future confirmed cases on a global scale. Using the 69 days data (from January 22, 2020 to March 30, 2020), the EVDs model predicted the number of confirmed cases from March 31, 2020 to April 9, 2020 (validation period) with an absolute percentage error < 15 % and then projected the number of confirmed cases until the end of June 2020. Also, we have quantified the uncertainty in the future projections due to the delay in reporting of the confirmed cases on a global scale. Based on the projections, we found that total confirmed cases would reach around 11.4 million globally by the end of June 2020.The USA may have 2.9 million number of confirmed cases followed by Spain(1.52 million) and Italy (1.28 million).","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M Aadhityaa","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"},{"author_name":"KS Kasiviswanathan","author_inst":"Department of Water Resources Development and Management, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"},{"author_name":"Idhayachandhiran Ilampooranan","author_inst":"Department of Water Resources Development and Management, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"},{"author_name":"B Soundharajan","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"},{"author_name":"M Balamurugan","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jianxun He","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20069179","rel_title":"The current COVID-19 wave will likely be mitigated in the second-line European countries","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20069179","rel_abs":"Objective. Countries presently apply different strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Differences in population structures, decision making, health systems and numerous other factors result in various trajectories in terms of mortality at country scale. Our objective in this manuscript is to disentangle the future of second-line European countries (i.e. countries that present, today, a moderate death rate) with respect to the current COVID-19 wave. Method. We propose a data-driven approach, grounded on a mixture model, to forecast the dynamics of the number of deaths from COVID-19 in a given focal country using data from countries that are ahead in time in terms of COVID-19-induced mortality. In this approach, the mortality curves of ahead-in-time countries are used to build predictors, which are then used as the components of the mixture model. This approach was applied to eight second-line European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden), using Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom as well as the Hubei province in China to build predictors. For this analysis, we used data pooled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Results. In general, the second-line European countries tend to follow relatively mild mortality curves (typically, those of Switzerland and Hubei) rather than fast and severe ones (typically, those of Spain, Italy, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom). From a methodological viewpoint, the performance of our forecasting approach is about 80% up to 8 days in the future, as soon as the focal country has accumulated at least two hundreds of deaths. Discussion. Our results suggest that the continuation of the current COVID-19 wave across Europe will likely be mitigated, and not as strong as it was in most of the front-line countries first impacted by the wave.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Soubeyrand","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Melina Ribaud","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Virgile Baudrot","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denis Allard","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20069443","rel_title":"A Path to the End of COIVD-19 - a Mathematical Model","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20069443","rel_abs":"In this work we use mathematical modeling to describe a possible route to the end of COVID-19, which does not feature either vaccination or herd immunity. We call this route self-burnout. We consider a region with (a) no influx of corona cases from the outside, (b) extensive social distancing, though not necessarily a full lockdown, and (c) high testing capacity relative to the actual number of new cases per day. These conditions can make it possible for the region to initiate the endgame phase of epidemic management, wherein the disease is slowly made to burn itself out through a combination of social distancing, sanitization, contact tracing and preventive testing. The dynamics of the case trajectories in this regime are governed by a single-variable first order linear delay differential equation, whose stability criterion can be obtained analytically. Basis this criterion, we conclude that the social mobility restrictions should be such as to ensure that on the average, one person interacts closely (from the transmission viewpoint) with at most one other person over a 4-5 day period. If the endgame can be played out for a long enough time, we claim that the Coronavirus can eventually get completely contained without affecting a significant fraction of the region's population. We present estimates of the duration for which the epidemic is expected to last, finding an interval of approximately 5-15 weeks after the self-burnout phase is initiated. South Korea, Austria, Australia, New Zealand and the states of Goa, Kerala and Odisha in India appear to be well on the way towards containing COVID by this method.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B Shayak","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Richard H Rand","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Virgile Baudrot","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denis Allard","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20069021","rel_title":"America Addresses Two Epidemics: Cannabis and Coronavirus and their Interactions: An Ecological Geospatial Study","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20069021","rel_abs":"Importance. Covid-19 infection has major international health and economic impacts and risk factors for infection are not completely understood. Cannabis smoking is linked with poor respiratory health, immunosuppression and multiple contaminants. Potential synergism between the two epidemics would represent a major public health convergence. Cigarettes were implicated with disease severity in Wuhan, China. Objective. Is cannabis use epidemiologically associated with coronavirus incidence rate (CVIR)? Design. Cross-sectional state-based multivariable study. Setting. USA. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures. CVIR. Multivariable-adjusted geospatially-weighted regression models. As the American cannabis epidemic is characterized by a recent doubling of daily cannabis use it was considered important to characterize the contribution of high intensity use. Results. Significant associations of daily cannabis use quintile with CVIR were identified with the highest quintile having a prevalence ratio 5.11 (95%C.I. 4.90-5.33), an attributable fraction in the exposed (AFE) 80.45% (79.61-81.25%) and an attributable fraction in the population of 77.80% (76.88-78.68%) with Chi-squared-for-trend (14,782, df=4) significant at P<10-500. Similarly when cannabis legalization was considered decriminalization was associated with an elevated CVIR prevalence ratio 4.51 (95%C.I. 4.45-4.58), AFE 77.84% (77.50-78.17%) and Chi-squared-for-trend (56,679, df=2) significant at P<10-500. Monthly and daily use were linked with CVIR in bivariate geospatial regression models (P=0.0027, P=0.0059). In multivariable additive models number of flight origins and population density were significant. In interactive geospatial models adjusted for international travel, ethnicity, income, population, population density and drug use, terms including last month cannabis were significant from P=7.3x10-15, daily cannabis use from P=7.3x10-11 and last month cannabis was independently associated (P=0.0365). Conclusions and Relevance. Data indicate CVIR demonstrates significant trends across cannabis use intensity quintiles and with relaxed cannabis legislation. Recent cannabis use is independently predictive of CVIR in bivariate and multivariable adjusted models and intensity of use is interactively significant. Cannabis thus joins tobacco as a SARS2-CoV-2 risk factor.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert S Reece","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Gary K Hulse","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Virgile Baudrot","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denis Allard","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20069245","rel_title":"Importance of Social Distancing: Modeling the spread of 2019-nCoV using Susceptible-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered-t model","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20069245","rel_abs":"Background The Novel Coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has raised global concerns and has been declared a pandemic. The infection shows the primary symptoms of pneumonia and has an incubation period, with the majority of people showing symptoms within 14 days. Online Social Networks are the closest simulations of real-world networks and have similar topology characteristics. This article simulates the spread and control of the nCoV-19 using the SIQR-t model to highlight the importance of self-quarantine and exercise of proper health care as a method to prevent the spread of the virus. Method The article uses the Susceptible-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered model with modification, introducing 14 different Infected states depending on the number of days the host has been carrying the infection. We simulate the spread of 2019-nCoV on human interaction similar graph taken from Online Social Network Epinions, of about 75000 nodes, similar to a small town or settlement. The infection rates depend on the sanitation and cleanliness these people exercise. Results When people practice self-quarantine and hygiene, aided by the governmental efforts of testing and quarantine, the cumulative number of affected people fall drastically. The decrease is apparent in time-based simulations of the spread received from the study. Conclusion The 2019-nCoV is a highly infectious zoonotic virus. It has spread like a pandemic, and governments across the world have launched quarantines. The results of the SIQR-t model indicate that hygiene and social-distancing can reduce its impact and sharply decrease the infection scale. Individual efforts are key to the control.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nipun aggarwal","author_inst":"Delhi Technological University"},{"author_name":"Gary K Hulse","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Virgile Baudrot","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denis Allard","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20069161","rel_title":"Mortality from COVID-19 in 12 countries and 6 states of the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20069161","rel_abs":"Importance: Reliable estimates of COVID-19 mortality are crucial to aid control strategies and to assess the effectiveness of interventions. Objective: Project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1, 2020, in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12, 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM) is an open, transparent, and continuously updated (www.cghr.org\/covid) statistical model that combines actual COVID-19 mortality counts with Bayesian inference to forecast COVID-19 deaths, the date of peak deaths, and the duration of excess mortality. The analyses covered a total of 700 million population above age 20 in 12 countries or regions: USA; Italy; Spain; France; UK; Iran; Belgium; a province of China (Hubei, which accounted for 90% of reported Chinese deaths); Germany; the Netherlands; Switzerland; and Canada; and six US states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, California, and Washington. Results: Forecasted deaths across the 12 current high-burden countries sum 167,000 to 593,000 (median 253,000). The trajectory of US deaths (49,000-249,000 deaths; median 86,000)- over half of which are expected in states beyond the initial six states analysed in this study- will have the greatest impact on the eventual total. Mortality ranges are 25,000-109,000 (median 46,000) in the UK; 23,000-31,000 (median 26,000) in Italy; 21,000-37,000 (median 26,000) in France and 21,000-32,000 (median 25,000) in Spain. Estimates are most precise for Hubei, China, where the epidemic curve is complete, and least precise in California, where it is ongoing. New York has the highest cumulative median mortality rate per million (1135), about 12-fold that of Germany. Mortality trajectories are notably flatter in Germany, California, and Washington State, each of which took physical distancing and testing strategies seriously. Using past country-specific mortality as a guide, GCAM predicts surge capacity needs, reaching more than twice existing capacity in a number of places., In every setting, the results might be sensitive to undercounts of COVID-19 deaths, which are already apparent. Conclusion and Relevance: Mortality from COVID-19 will be substantial across many settings, even in the best case scenario. GCAM will provide continually updated and increasingly precise estimates as the pandemic progresses.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Brown","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Prabhat Jha","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"CGHR COVID Mortality Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Denis Allard","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20068387","rel_title":"Predicting the impact of asymptomatic transmission,non-pharmaceutical intervention and testing on the spread of COVID19COVID19","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20068387","rel_abs":"We introduce a novel mathematical model to analyze the effect of removing non-pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of COVID19 as a function of disease testing rate.

To probe the origin and transmission dynamics of this virus, we performed phylodynamic analysis of 247 high quality genomic sequences of viruses available in the GISAID platform as of March 05, 2020. A substantial number of earliest sequences reported in Wuhan in December 2019, including those of viruses recovered from the Huanan Seafood Market (HNSM), the site of the initial outbreak, were genetically diverse, suggesting that viruses of multiple sources were involved in the original outbreak. The viruses were subsequently disseminated to different parts of China and other countries, with diverse mutational profiles being recorded in strains recovered subsequently. Interestingly, four genetic clusters defined as Super-transmitters (STs) were found to become dominant and were responsible for the major outbreaks in various countries. Among the four clusters, ST1 is widely disseminated in Asia and the US and mainly responsible for outbreaks in the states of Washington and California in the US as well as those in South Korea at the end of February and early March, whereas ST4 contributed to the pandemic in Europe. Each ST cluster carried a signature mutation profile which allowed us to trace the origin and transmission patterns of specific viruses in different parts of the world. Using the signature mutations as markers of STs, we further analysed 1539 genome sequences reported after February 29, 2020. We found that around 90% of these genomes belonged to STs with ST4 being the dominant one and their contribution to pandemic in different continents were also depicted. The identification of these super-transmitters provides insight into the control of further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuemei YANG","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ning Dong","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wai-Chi CHAN","author_inst":"The Hong Kong polytechnic university"},{"author_name":"Sheng CHEN","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20071944","rel_title":"Community and Socioeconomic Factors Associated with COVID-19 in the United States: Zip code level cross sectional analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20071944","rel_abs":"Background: Multiple reports have pointed towards involvement of community and socioeconomic characteristics of people in the United States may be associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths.

A multivariable linear regression model noted that 1% increase in the proportion of residents above the age of 65 years, proportion of African American residents, proportion of females, persons per household and population density of the zip code increased the proportion of positive cases by 0.77%, 0.23%, 1.64%, 1.83% and 0.46% respectively (P<0.01) with only population density remaining significant in zip codes with greater than median number of cases. In zips with greater than median number of deaths, no community\/socio-economic factor contributed significantly to death. Conclusion: This study gives early signals of gender, and racial inequalities while providing overwhelming evidence of how population density may contribute to an increase in the number of positive cases of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avirup Guha","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Janice Bonsu","author_inst":"Ohio State University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amit Dey","author_inst":"National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute"},{"author_name":"Daniel Addison","author_inst":"The Ohio State University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Denys Pommeret","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Gergo Jozsef Szollosi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szilvia Harsanyi","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Szabolcs Garboczy","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"},{"author_name":"Judit Zsuga","author_inst":"University of Debrecen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20071803","rel_title":"Impacts of Early Interventions on the Age-Specific Incidence of COVID-19 in New York, Los Angeles, Daegu and Nairobi","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20071803","rel_abs":"Background COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented public health crisis and economic shock to the global economy. While many countries were affected, regions with an older population and weaker public health interventions tended to suffer more morbidity and mortality. Here we model and quantify the age-specific incidence of COVID-19 in four pandemic cities under different interventions. Methods We developed an age-specific and multiple-stage susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-hospitalized-quarantined-dead (SEIR-HQD) dynamical systems model expanded from the more basic SEIR model by incorporating location- and age-specific contact matrices to estimate the outcomes of COVID-19. Utilizing latest estimates of epidemiological parameters and demographic data, we model the potential effects of various interventions in four representative cities with different population structures - New York, Los Angeles, Daegu and Nairobi. We compared the effects of different interventions in the age-structure populations specific to each city. These policy options are then applied to determine the potential for effective containment. We model these dynamic policy scenarios to assess the risks of less-stringent social distancing, as has been proposed by those arguing to enhance economic activity over public health and safety. Finally, we explored the health impacts of different policy action timelines to understand the benefits of early interventions. Findings We find the spread of COVID-19 to be dramatically different in the regions modeled, with the primary drivers the variation of population age structures, and the dynamics of interactions of the younger demographics, whose higher interaction rates can lead to increasing transmission rates across these communities. A city with younger citizens may also have fewer hospitalized cases and deaths. Our modeling quantifies the value of early interventions, which avoided an additional 5%, 16%, 37% and 43% of the infections in Daegu, Nairobi, New York and Los Angeles, respectively, compared to what has been observed in the four cities. The finding is clear: in the absence of pharmaceutical options, delaying strict social policy interventions has resulted in substantial public health cost. This modeling can, and will, be applied to other cities and regions, and conducted in conjunction with other health insults, such as exposure to air pollution. Critically, we find that school closures, working from home, and reduction in other mobility were most beneficial for younger population (0-19 years old), middle-age (20-59 years old) population and older population (60 years and older), respectively across each city. Specifically, school closure avoided 25%, 18%, 16% and 12% of the infections for the population under 20 years old in Daegu, Los Angeles, New York and Nairobi, respectively. A 50% and 80% population working from home policy avoids 8% and 15% of the infections. Reduction in mobility was more effective than the working from home strategy. Any single social distancing policy if enacted alone can delay the spread of COVID-19 but was unable to totally suppress the infection. Coordinated policy action can be highly effective. Increasing the quarantine rate to 10% of infectious cases was more effective than strict social distancing alone in this study, although together they can suppress 80% of the epidemic. A combination of moderate social distancing and quarantine strategies was able to avoid 99% of the infections. Interpretation Moderate social distancing together with high quarantine rates was effective in each of the four cities. COVID-19 caused more deaths and hospitalization in cities with an ageing population than those with a younger population. However, in the cities with a younger population, there is a clear need to implement a social distancing strategy that is even more strict due to the higher transmission rates among younger people. Cities with more older people should prepare more hospital beds and healthcare facilities to save people who are in critical conditions. Cities with ageing population should take targeted action for the elderly to avoid the severe impacts on the vulnerable populations. Increasing quarantine rate is an effective strategy to avoid the substantial infection while also does not influence the economy fiercely. We recommend countries or regions experiencing, or likely to experience the rapid spread of COVID-19, to implement combination of multiple strategies in the early stage of the breakout which can avoid over 90% of infected cases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hao Yin","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhu Liu","author_inst":"Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Daniel M.

In Italy, there is a continued COVID-19 growth of cases and deaths that requires control measures for the correct management of the epidemiological emergency. To contribute to increasing the overall knowledge of COVID-19, systematic tests in the general population are required. Here, we describe the first Italian survey performed in 727 employees belonging to a Mother-Child Research hospital tested for both viral (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) and antibody presence. Individuals were divided into three risk categories (high, medium and low) according to their job activity. Only one subject was positive at the swab test while 17.2% of the cohort was positive for the presence of antibodies. Results highlighted that the presence of Positive antibodies is significantly associated with high and medium risk exposure occupation (p-value=0.026) as well as cold and conjunctivitis symptoms (p-value=0.016 and 0.042 respectively). Moreover, among healthcare professionals, the category of medical doctors showed a significant association with the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (p-value=0.0127). Finally, we detected a rapid decrease in antibody intensity between two assessments performed within a very short period (p-value=0.009). Overall, the present study increases our knowledge of the epidemiological data of COVID-19 infection in Italy, suggesting a high prevalence of immune individuals (i.e. at least among at-risk

Spatial modeling could be used to approach an understanding of structural and sociodemographic factors that have impacted COVID-19 spread at a province-level in Iran. In the present paper, we developed a spatial statistical approach to describe how COVID-19 cases are spatially distributed and to identify significant spatial clusters of cases and how the socioeconomic features of Iranian provinces might predict the number of cases. We identified a cluster of provinces with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 cases around Tehran, which indicated that the spread of COVID-19 within Iran was spatially correlated. Urbanized, highly connected provinces with older population structures and higher average temperatures were the most susceptible to present a higher number of COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, literacy is a protective factor that might be directly related to health literacy and compliance with public health measures. These features indicate that policies related to social distancing, protecting older adults, and vulnerable populations, as well as promoting health literacy, might be targeted to reduce SARS-CoV2 spread in Iran. Our approach could be applied to model COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries with similar characteristics or in case of an upturn in COVID-19 within

The purpose of our study is to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient outcomes and the healthcare system in Ontario, Canada. Methods: We developed an individual-level simulation to model the flow of COVID-19 patients through the Ontario healthcare system. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory and healthcare capacity. Outcomes include numbers of patients needing admission to the ward, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and requiring ventilation; days to resource depletion; and numbers of patients awaiting resources and deaths associated with limited access to resources. Findings: We demonstrate that with effective early public health measures system resources need not be depleted. For scenarios considering late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, health system resources would be depleted within 14-26 days. Resource depletion was also avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to rapidly increase ICU, ventilator, and acute care hospital capacity. Interpretation: We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures the Ontario healthcare system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19, despite the rapid capacity increase. This overall lack of resources would have led to an increase in mortality. By slowing the spread of the disease via ongoing public health measures and having increased healthcare capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its health care system.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kali Barrett","author_inst":"University Health Network"},{"author_name":"Yasin A Khan","author_inst":"University Health Network"},{"author_name":"Stephen Mac","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Raphael Ximenes","author_inst":"Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative, University Health Network"},{"author_name":"David MJ Naimark","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre"},{"author_name":"Beate Sander","author_inst":"Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative, University Health Network"},{"author_name":"Roberta Bottega","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Petra Carli","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Cassone","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eulalia Catamo","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Cocca","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Del Pin","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mariateresa Di Stazio","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Agnese Feresin","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Martina La Bianca","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Morassut","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Morgan","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giulia Pelliccione","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Petix","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giulia Ragusa","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonietta Robino","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Russian","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Spedicati","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sarah Suergiu","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marianela Urriza","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fulvia Vascotto","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paola Toscani","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Girotto","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paolo Gasparini","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20071845","rel_title":"The importance of timing of a population level intervention on COVID-19 mortality","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20071845","rel_abs":"COVID-19 poses an immense and immediate threat to global public health. Population level interventions (PLIs) impact this threat, with estimable large effects on reducing mortality. Many countries worldwide have currently zero\/low mortality and many have yet to implement such PLIs. The importance of timing of PLI implementation on mortality outcomes is poorly understood. We extracted cumulative country-specific COVID-19 mortality for France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK to examine country-specific mortality trends and found that all five countries experienced COVID-19 mortality epidemics initially of exponential nature. We estimated the magnitude of effect on mortality of the nationwide PLI implemented on day 18 of Italy's mortality epidemic and assessed the importance of timing of PLI implementation by computing the effect of implementation of a PLI of this magnitude at various times on subsequent mortality. The nationwide PLI in Italy saved an estimated 6,170 lives by day 30 of the Italian epidemic. Implementing a PLI with this effect magnitude in a country of 60 million people on the day of the first death, and on days 7, 10, 14 and 17 thereafter, compared to implementation on day 18, resulted in substantially greater numbers of lives saved. Implementation on day 1 resulted in an additional 3,477 lives saved, 6,955 intensive care unit admissions and 52,162 hospital admissions prevented, beyond that achieved by implementation on day 18. PLI implementation earlier than day 18 substantially enhances benefit. Intervention on the day of the first mortality event in a country achieves the greatest benefit.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasper S Johnston","author_inst":"Virtus

disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a large New York City (NYC) medical center and describe their clinical course across the emergency department (ED), inpatient wards, and intensive care units (ICUs). Design: Retrospective manual medical record review. Setting: NewYork-Presbyterian\/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP\/CUIMC), a quaternary care academic medical center in NYC. Participants: The first 1000 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Methods: We identified the first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive RT-SARS-CoV-2 PCR test who first presented to the ED or were hospitalized at NYP\/CUIMC between March 1 and April 5, 2020. Patient data was manually abstracted from the electronic medical record. Main outcome measures: We describe patient characteristics including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition. Results: Among the first 1000 patients, 150 were ED patients, 614 were admitted without requiring ICU-level care, and 236 were admitted or transferred to the ICU. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (73.2%), fever (72.8%), and dyspnea (63.1%). Hospitalized patients, and ICU patients in particular, most commonly had baseline comorbidities including of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. ICU patients were older, predominantly male (66.9%), and long lengths of stay (median 23 days; IQR 12 to 32 days); 78.0% developed AKI and 35.2% required dialysis. Notably, for patients who required mechanical ventilation, only 4.4% were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at 3-4 and 9 days. As of April 30, 90 patients remained hospitalized and 211 had died in the hospital. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness at this medical center faced significant morbidity and mortality, with high rates of AKI, dialysis, and a bimodal distribution in time to intubation from symptom onset.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael G Argenziano","author_inst":"Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and

Timely epidemiological surveillance is essential for outbreak response, but is complicated by a high proportion of silent (non-symptomatic) infections and limited testing resources. Methods: We used a stochastic, individual-based model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission along detailed inter-individual contact networks describing patient-staff interactions in real LTCF settings. We distributed nasopharyngeal swabs and RT-PCR tests using clinical and demographic indications, and evaluated the efficacy and resource-efficiency of a range of surveillance strategies, including group testing (sample pooling) and testing cascades, which couple (i) testing for multiple indications (symptoms, admission) with (ii) random daily testing. Results: In the baseline scenario, randomly introducing SARS-CoV-2 into a 170-bed LTCF led to large outbreaks, with a cumulative 86 (6-224) infections after three weeks of unmitigated transmission. Efficacy of symptom-based screening was limited by (i) lags between infection and symptom onset, and (ii) silent transmission from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections. Testing upon admission detected up to 66% of patients silently infected upon LTCF entry, but missed potential introductions from staff. Random daily testing was more effective when targeting patients than staff, but was overall an inefficient use of limited resources. At high testing capacity (>1 test\/10 beds\/day), cascades were most effective, with a 22-52% probability of detecting outbreaks prior to any nosocomial transmission, and 38-63% prior to first onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Conversely, at low capacity (<1 test\/85 beds\/day), pooling randomly selected patients in a daily group test was most effective (9-15% probability of detecting outbreaks prior to transmission; 30-44% prior to symptoms). The most efficient strategy compared to the reference was to pool individuals with any COVID-like symptoms, requiring only 5-7 additional tests and 17-24 additional swabs to detect outbreaks 5-6 days earlier, prior to an additional 14-18 infections. Conclusions: Group testing is an effective and efficient COVID-19 surveillance strategy for resource-limited LTCFs. Cascades are even more effective given ample testing resources. Increasing testing capacity and updating surveillance protocols accordingly could facilitate earlier detection of emerging outbreaks, informing a need for urgent intervention in settings with ongoing nosocomial transmission.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David RM Smith","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Audrey Duval","author_inst":"Institut

We analyzed scenarios implementing strong containment measures, similar to those imposed in Europe.

spread of diseases such as the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, all models are based on simplifying assumptions and on sparse data. This limits the reliability of parameter estimates and predictions. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the relevance of these limitations by performing a study of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. We perform parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis and model selection for a range of established epidemiological models. Amongst others, we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, parameter and prediction profile calculation algorithms. Our results show that parameter estimates and predictions obtained for several established models on the basis of reported case numbers can be subject to substantial uncertainty. More importantly, estimates were often unrealistic and the confidence \/ credibility intervals did not cover plausible values of critical parameters obtained using different approaches. These findings suggest, amongst others, that several models are over-simplistic and that the reported case numbers provide often insufficient information.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elba Raim\u00fandez","author_inst":"University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Erika Dudkin","author_inst":"University of

worldwide and threatens millions of lives. It remains unknown if summer weather will reduce its continued spread, thereby alleviating strains on hospitals and providing time for vaccine development. Early insights from laboratory studies of related coronaviruses predicted that COVID-19 would decline at higher temperatures, humidity, and ultraviolet light. Using current, fine-scaled weather data and global reports of infection we developed a model that explained 36% of variation in early growth rates before intervention, with 17% based on weather or demography and 19% based on country-specific effects. We found that ultraviolet light was most strongly associated with lower COVID-19 growth rates. Projections suggest that, in the absence of intervention, COVID-19 will decrease temporarily during summer, rebound by autumn, and peak next winter. However, uncertainty remains high and the probability of a weekly doubling rate remained >20% throughout the summer in the absence of control. Consequently, aggressive policy interventions will likely be needed in spite of seasonal trends.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cory Merow","author_inst":"University of

Critically ill COVID-19 patients have relatively well-preserved lung mechanics despite severe gas exchange abnormalities, a feature not consistent with classical ARDS but more consistent with pulmonary vascular disease. Patients with severe COVID-19 also demonstrate markedly abnormal coagulation, with elevated D-dimers and higher rates of venous thromboembolism. We present five cases of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia with severe respiratory failure and shock, with evidence of markedly elevated dead-space ventilation who received tPA. All showed post treatment immediate improvements in gas exchange and\/or hemodynamics. We suspect that severe COVID-19 pneumonia causes respiratory failure via pulmonary microthrombi and endothelial dysfunction. Treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia may warrant anticoagulation for milder cases and thrombolysis for more severe disease.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hooman D Poor","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Corey E.

Since then the epidemic has taken different trajectories across different geographical locations in the country. This study explores the population aggregated trajectories of COVID19 susceptible, infected and recovered or dead cases in the south Indian state of Telangana with a population of approximately 40 million. Information on cases reported from March 2 to April 4 was collated from government records. The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model for the spread of an infectious disease was used. Transmission parameters were extracted from existing literature that has emerged over past weeks from other regions with similar population densities as Telangana. Optimisation algorithms were used to get basic reproduction rate for different phases of nonpharmaceutical interventions rolled by the government. Peak accumulation is projected towards end of July with 36% of the population being infected by August 2020 if the population lockdown or social distancing mechanism is not continued. The number of deaths assuming no intervention is projected to be 488000 (95% CI: (329400, 646600)). A draconian enforcement of population lockdown combined with hand and face hygiene adherence would reduce the transmission by at least 99.7% whereas partial social distancing and hygiene would reduce it by 51.2%. Transmission parameters reported should be interpreted with caution as they are population aggregated and do not consider unique characteristics of susceptibility among micro-clusters and vulnerable individuals. More data will need to be collected to optimize transmission parameters and evaluate the full complexity, to simulate real world scenarios in the models.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rashmi Pant","author_inst":"Society for Health Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA)"},{"author_name":"Lincoln Priyadarshi Choudhry","author_inst":"Krashapana consultancy private limited"},{"author_name":"Jammy Guru Rajesh","author_inst":"Society for Health Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA)"},{"author_name":"Vijay V Yeldandi","author_inst":"Society for Health Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA)"},{"author_name":"Gregory Serrao","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Amanda Zeidman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Neha S.

To identify the key parameters or processes that have the greatest effects on the pandemic and reveal the different progressions of epidemics in different countries, we quantified enhanced control measures and the dynamics of the production and provision of medical resources. We then nested these within a COVID-19 epidemic transmission model, which is parameterized by multi-source data. We obtained rate functions related to the intensity of mitigation measures, the effective reproduction numbers and the timings and durations of runs on medical resources, given differing control measures implemented in various countries. Increased detection rates may induce runs on medical resources and prolong their durations, depending on resource availability. Nevertheless, improving the detection rate can effectively and rapidly reduce the mortality rate, even after runs on medical resources. Combinations of multiple prevention and control strategies and timely improvement of abilities to supplement medical resources are key to effective control of the COVID-19 epidemic. A 50% reduction in comprehensive control measures would have led to the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths exceeding 590000 and 60000, respectively, by 27 March 2020 in mainland China. The proposed model can assist health authorities to predict when they will be most in need of hospital beds and equipment such as ventilators, personal protection equipment, drugs and staff.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xia Wang","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Qian Li","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Sun","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Sha He","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Fan Xia","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Song","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yiming Shao","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Robert A.
