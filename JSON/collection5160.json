The objective of this article is to estimate the influence of the hospital care system on lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19 epidemic, by analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital case-fatality rate between French districts (i.e. French departements). The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed by districts are mostly related to the level of morbidity, therefore to the overwhelming of the healthcare systems during the acute phases of the epidemic. However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate and cannot explain the magnitude of the variations in case-fatality rate reported per country by international organizations or information sites. These differences can only be explained by the systems for reporting cases and deaths, which, indeed, vary greatly from country to country, and not attributed to the care or treatment of patients, even during hospital stress due to epidemic peaks.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc SOURIS","author_inst":"Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD)"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Gonzalez","author_inst":"Georgetown University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20103820","rel_title":"Analysis of temporal trends in potential COVID-19 cases reported through NHS Pathways England","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20103820","rel_abs":"The NHS Pathways triage system collates data on enquiries to 111 and 999 services in England. Since the 18th of March 2020, these data have been made publically available for potential COVID-19 symptoms self-reported by members of the public. Trends in such reports over time are likely to reflect behaviour of the ongoing epidemic within the wider community, potentially capturing valuable information across a broader severity profile of cases than hospital admission data. We present a fully reproducible analysis of temporal trends in NHS Pathways reports until 14th May 2020, nationally and regionally, and demonstrate that rates of growth\/decline and effective reproduction number estimated from these data may be useful in monitoring transmission. This is a particularly pressing issue as lockdown restrictions begin to be lifted and evidence of disease resurgence must be constantly reassessed. We further assess the correlation between NHS Pathways reports and a publicly available NHS dataset of COVID-19-associated deaths in England, finding that enquiries to 111\/999 were strongly associated with daily deaths reported 16 days later. Our results highlight the potential of NHS Pathways as the basis of an early warning system. However, this dataset relies on self-reported symptoms, which are at risk of being severely biased. Further detailed work is therefore necessary to investigate potential behavioural issues which might otherwise explain our conclusions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quentin J Leclerc","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Nightingale","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Thibaut Jombart","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20103747","rel_title":"Evaluate the timing of resumption of business for the states of New York, New Jersey and California via a pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission model of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20103747","rel_abs":"The United States has the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world. The early hot spot states were New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The workforce in these states was required to work from home except for essential services. It was necessary to evaluate an appropriate date for resumption of business since the premature reopening of the economy would lead to a broader spread of COVID-19, while the opposite situation would cause greater loss of economy. To reflect the real-time risk of the spread of COVID-19, it was crucial to evaluate the population of infected individuals before or never being confirmed due to the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmissions of COVID-19. To this end, we proposed an epidemic model and applied it to evaluate the real-time risk of epidemic for the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. We used California as the benchmark state because California began a phased reopening on May 8, 2020. The dates on which the estimated numbers of unidentified infectious individuals per 100,000 for states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut were close to those in California on May 8, 2020, were June 1, 22, and 22, 2020, respectively. By the practice in California, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut might consider reopening their business. Meanwhile, according to our simulation models, to prevent the resurgence of infections after reopening the economy, it would be crucial to maintain sufficient measures to limit the social distance after the resumption of businesses. This precaution turned out to be critical as the situation in California quickly deteriorated after our analysis was completed and its interventions after the reopening of business were not as effective as those in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Tian","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianbin Tan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yukang Jiang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Wang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20103879","rel_title":"The Effects of Stringent Interventions for Coronavirus Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20103879","rel_abs":"The pandemic of COVID-19 has caused severe public health consequences around the world.

We found that there were statistically significant treatment effects of those stringent interventions which reduced the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. Those reduction effects would increase over time. Also, if the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number. The effects of stringent interventions are significant in mitigating the epidemic situation of COVID-19. The slower the interventions were implemented, the more severe the epidemic would have been, and the stronger the interventions would have been required.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Tian","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wenxiang Luo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yukang Jiang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Minqiong Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Canhong Wen","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Wenliang Pan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Wang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20104430","rel_title":"A Real-Time Statistical Model for Tracking and Forecasting COVID-19 Deaths, Prevalence and Incidence","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20104430","rel_abs":"Background: Pandemics do not occur frequently and when they do there is a paucity of forecasting tools that could help drive government responses to mitigate worst outcomes. Here we provide a forecasting model that is based on measurable variables and that strives for simplicity over complexity to obtain stable convergent forecasts of death, prevalence, incidence, and safe days for social easing. Methods: We assume, based on prior pandemic data, that death rate rise and fall approximately follows a Gaussian distribution, which can be asymmetric, which we describe. By taking daily death data for foreign countries and U.S. states and fitting it to an appropriate Gaussian function provides an estimate of where in the cycle a particular population lies. From that time point one can integrate remaining time to obtain a final total death. By also using measured values for the time from infection to recovery or death and a mortality factor, the prevalence (active cases) and incidence (new cases) totals and rate curves can be constructed. It is also possible by setting a downward threshold on prevalence that an estimate of a minimum date to begin relaxing social restrictions may be considered. Results: To demonstrate the model we chose the most severe hot-bed countries and U.S. states as a test-bed to evolve and improve our model and to compare with other models. The model can readily be applied to other countries by inputting data from public data bases. We also compare our forecasts to the University of Washington (UW) IHME model and are reassuringly similar yet show less variability on a weekly basis. The sum of squares for error (SSE) for international and U.S. states, respectively, that we track are: 26% and 26% for our model vs. 41% and 46% for the IHME model. Conclusions: Our model appears closest to the UW IHME model; however, there are important differences and while both models forecast many of the same results of interest, each one offers unique benefits that the other does not. We believe that the model reported here excels for its simplicity, which makes the model easy to use.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack A.

We sought to estimate the potential long-term epidemiological impact of such disruptions on TB burden in high-burden countries, and how this negative impact could be mitigated. Methods We adapted mathematical models of TB transmission in three high-burden countries (India, Kenya and Ukraine) to incorporate lockdown-associated disruptions in the TB care cascade. The anticipated level of disruption reflected consensus from a rapid expert consultation. We modelled the impact of these disruptions on TB incidence and mortality over the next five years, and also considered potential interventions to curtail this impact. Results Even temporary disruptions can cause long-term increases in TB incidence and mortality. We estimated that a 3-month lockdown, followed by 10 months to restore normal TB services, would cause, over the next 5 years, an additional 1.92 million TB cases (Crl 1.74 - 2.15) and 488,000 TB deaths (CrI 449 - 541 thousand) in India, 48,000 (33,400 - 72,320) TB cases and 16,800 deaths (11.9 - 21.9 thousand) in Kenya, and 9,100 (6,980 - 11,200) cases and 1,960 deaths (1,620 - 2,350) in Ukraine. However, any such negative impacts could be averted through supplementary 'catch-up' TB case detection and treatment, once restrictions are eased. Interpretation Lockdown-related disruptions can cause long-lasting increases in TB burden, but these negative effects can be mitigated with targeted interventions implemented rapidly once lockdowns are lifted.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia Cilloni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Han Fu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Juan F Vesga","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"David Dowdy","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Carel Pretorius","author_inst":"Avenir Health"},{"author_name":"Sevim Ahmedov","author_inst":"United States Agency for International Development"},{"author_name":"Sreenivas A Nair","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Andrei Mosneaga","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Enos O Masini","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Sahu Suvanand","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Nimalan Arinaminpathy","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20104471","rel_title":"Is Nigeria really on top of COVID-19?

This kind of question is appropriate for public health responses and it will depend on the early estimates of the key epidemiological parameters of the virus in a defined population. In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of Covid-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R_0). This also enables us to estimate the daily transmission rate ({beta}) that determines the effect of social distancing. We further estimate the reported fraction of symptomatic cases. The models are applied to the NCDC data on Covid-19 symptomatic and death cases from 27 February 2020 and 7 May 2020. In this period, the effective reproduction number is estimated with a minimum value of 0.18 and a maximum value of 1.78. Most importantly, the R(t) is strictly greater than one from April 13 till 7 May 2020. The R_0 is estimated to be 2.42 with credible interval: (2.37, 2.47). Comparing this with the R(t) shows that control measures are working but not effective enough to keep R(t) below one. Also, the estimated fractional reported symptomatic cases are between 10 to 50%. Our analysis has shown evidence that the existing control measures are not enough to end the epidemic and more stringent measures are needed.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adeshina Israel Adekunle","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Oyelola Adegboye","author_inst":"James Cook University, Townsville"},{"author_name":"Ezra Gayawan","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology, Akure"},{"author_name":"Emma McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University, Townsville"},{"author_name":"Carel Pretorius","author_inst":"Avenir Health"},{"author_name":"Sevim Ahmedov","author_inst":"United States Agency for International Development"},{"author_name":"Sreenivas A Nair","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Andrei Mosneaga","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Enos O Masini","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Sahu Suvanand","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Nimalan Arinaminpathy","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20097667","rel_title":"People Behavior Changes in China during COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20097667","rel_abs":"While most countries implemented measures to reduce people activities and gathering to contain the coronavirus, the outcome may vary significantly depending on how and to what extent people behaviors have been changed.

Population structure and prior morbidities differ markedly between these countries from those where outbreaks were previously established. We predicted the relative impact of COVID-19 and the response in Uganda to understand whether the benefits could be outweighed by the costs. Design and setting Age-based COVID-19 mortality data from China were applied to the population structures of Uganda and countries with previously established outbreaks, comparing theoretical mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. Based on recent Ugandan data and theoretical scenarios of programme deterioration, we predicted potential additional disease burden for HIV\/AIDS, malaria and maternal mortality. Main outcome measures DALYs lost and mortality. Results Based on population age structure alone Uganda is predicted to have a relatively low COVID-19 burden compared to equivalent transmission in China and Western countries, with mortality and DALYs lost predicted to be 12% and 19% that of Italy. Scenarios of lockdown impact predict HIV\/AIDS and malaria equivalent to or higher than that of an extensive COVID-19 outbreak. Emerging HIV\/AIDS and maternal mortality data indicate that such deterioration could be occurring. Conclusions The results predict a relatively low COVID-19 impact on Uganda associated with its young population, with a high risk of negative impact on non-COVID-19 disease burden from a prolonged lockdown response. The results are likely to reflect the situation in other sub-Saharan populations, underlining the importance of tailoring COVID-19 responses to population structure and potential disease vulnerabilities.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Bell","author_inst":"Independent consultant, Issaquah, WA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristian Schultz Hansen","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Centre for Health Economics and Policy, University of Copenhagen, Oster Farimagsgade 5A, 1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Agnes N Kiragga","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kambugu","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"John Kissa","author_inst":"Uganda Ministry of Health - Division of Health Information, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Anthony K Mbonye","author_inst":"School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Sreenivas A Nair","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Andrei Mosneaga","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Enos O Masini","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Sahu Suvanand","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Nimalan Arinaminpathy","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20103796","rel_title":"Asymptomatic COVID-19 Have Longer Treatment Cycle Than Moderate Type of Confirmed Patients","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20103796","rel_abs":"Objectives A kind of pneumonia caused by unknown causes that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, was reported as a result of novel coronavirus infection on January 7, 2020, and then WHO named it COVID-19.

These neutralizing antibodies are shown to recognize distinct epitopes on the viral spike RBD, therefore they represent a promising basis for the design of efficient combined post-exposure therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tal Noy-Porat","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Efi Makdasi","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Ron Alcalay","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Adva Mechaly","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Yinon Levy","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Adi Bercovich-Kinori","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Ayelet Zauberman","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Hadas Tamir","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Yfat Yahalom-Ronen","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Eyal Epstein","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Hagit Achdout","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Sharon Melamed","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Theodor Chitlaru","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Shay Weiss","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Eldar Peretz","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Osnat Rosen","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Nir Paran","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Yitzhaki","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C.

The innate immune response is critical for protection against Coronaviruses. However, little is known about the interplay between the innate immune system and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally released on the apical, but not basolateral surface. Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNF, CXCL8. We also identified NF-{kappa}B and ATF4 transcription factors as key drivers of this pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III IFN induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pre-treatment or post-treatment with type I and III IFNs dramatically reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures and this corresponded with an upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 typically exhibits respiratory illness. Unexpectedly, emerging clinical reports indicate that neurological symptoms continue to rise, suggesting detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that a Dusseldorf isolate of SARS-CoV-2 enters 3D human brain organoids within two days of exposure. Using COVID-19 convalescent serum, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 preferably targets soma of cortical neurons but not neural stem cells, the target cell type of ZIKA virus. Imaging cortical neurons of organoids reveal that SARS-CoV-2 exposure is associated with missorted Tau from axons to soma, hyperphosphorylation, and apparent neuronal death. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 co-localizes specifically with Tau phosphorylated at Threonine-231 in the soma, indicative of early neurodegeneration-like effects. Our studies, therefore, provide initial insights into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 as a neurotropic virus and emphasize that brain organoids could model CNS pathologies of COVID-19.\n\nOne sentence summaryCOVID-19 modeling in human brain organoids","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jay Gopalakrishnan","author_inst":"Laboratory for Centrosome and Cytoskeleton Biology, Institute of Human Genetics, University hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf"},{"author_name":"Anand Ramani","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Lisa Mueller","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Philipp Niklas Ostermann","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Elke Gabriel","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Abida Islam Pranty","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Andreas Mueller-Shiffmann","author_inst":"Institute of neuropathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Aruljothi Mariappan","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Oliver Goureau","author_inst":"Institut de la Vision, Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, F-75012 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Henning Gruell","author_inst":"German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Walker","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Marcel Andree","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hauka","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Kai Wohlgemuth","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Heymut Omran","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Florian Klein","author_inst":"German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dagmar Wieczorek","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Ortwin Adams","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Carsten Korth","author_inst":"Institute of neuropathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Heiner Schaal","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Torsten Houwaart","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Dilthey","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.104885","rel_title":"RdRp mutations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.104885","rel_abs":"COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, started in China in late 2019, and soon became a global pandemic. With the help of thousands of viral genome sequences that have been accumulating, it has become possible to track the evolution of viral genome over time as it spread across the world. An important question that still needs to be answered is whether any of the common mutations affect the viral properties, and therefore the disease characteristics. Therefore, we sought to understand the effects of mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), particularly the common 14408C>T mutation, on mutation rate and viral spread. By focusing on mutations in the slowly evolving M or E genes, we aimed to minimize the effects of selective pressure. Our results indicate that 14408C>T mutation increases the mutation rate, while the third-most common RdRp mutation, 15324C>T, has the opposite effect. It is possible that 14408C>T mutation may have contributed to the dominance of its co-mutations in Europe and elsewhere.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Do\u011fa Eskier","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG)"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6khan Karak\u00fclah","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG)"},{"author_name":"Asl\u0131 Suner","author_inst":"Ege University"},{"author_name":"Yavuz Oktay","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center(IBG)"},{"author_name":"Elke Gabriel","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Abida Islam Pranty","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Andreas Mueller-Shiffmann","author_inst":"Institute of neuropathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Aruljothi Mariappan","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Oliver Goureau","author_inst":"Institut de la Vision, Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, F-75012 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Henning Gruell","author_inst":"German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Walker","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Marcel Andree","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hauka","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Kai Wohlgemuth","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Heymut Omran","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Florian Klein","author_inst":"German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dagmar Wieczorek","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Ortwin Adams","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Carsten Korth","author_inst":"Institute of neuropathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Heiner Schaal","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Torsten Houwaart","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Dilthey","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.107292","rel_title":"CD8+ T cell cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 conferred by other coronavirus strains and influenza virus","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.107292","rel_abs":"While individuals infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifested a broad range in susceptibility and severity to the disease, the pre-existing immune memory of related pathogens can influence the disease outcome.

Many tests have been developed, yet with variable speed to first result, and of unknown quality, particularly when considering the prediction of neutralizing capacity.\n\nOBJECTIVES\/METHODSThe LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG assay was designed to measure antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 native S1\/S2 proteins in a standardized automated chemiluminescent assay. Clinical and analytical performance of the test were validated in an observational study using residual samples (>1500) with positive or negative Covid-19 diagnosis.\n\nRESULTSThe LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG assay proved highly selective and specific, and offers semiquantitative measures of serum or plasma levels of anti-S1\/S2 IgG with neutralizing activity. The diagnostic sensitivity was 91.3% and 95.7% at >5 or [&ge;]15 days from diagnosis respectively, and 100% when assessed against a neutralizing assay. The specificity ranged between 97% and 98.5%. The average imprecision of the assay was <5 % coefficient of variation. Assay performance at 2 different cut-offs was evaluated to optimize predictive values in settings with different % disease prevalence. CONCLUSIONS. The automated LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG assay brings efficient, sensitive, specific, and precise serological testing to the laboratory, with the capacity to test large amounts of samples per day: first results are available within 35 minutes with a throughput of 170 tests\/hour. The test also provides a semiquantitative measure to identify samples with neutralizing antibodies, useful also for a large scale screening of convalescent plasma for safe therapeutic use.\n\nIMPORTANCEWith the worldwide advance of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficient, reliable and accessible diagnostic tools are needed to support public health officials and healthcare providers in their efforts to deliver optimal medical care, and articulate sound demographic policy. DiaSorin has developed an automated serology based assay for the measurement of IgG specific to SARS CoV-2 Spike protein, and tested its clinical performance in collaboration with Italian health care professionals who provided access to large numbers of samples from infected and non-infected individuals. The assay delivers excellent sensitivity and specificity, and is able to identify samples with high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This will provide guidance in assessing the true immune status of subjects, as well as meeting the pressing need to screen donors for high titer convalescent sera for subsequent therapeutic and prophylactic use.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabrizio Bonelli","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Antonella Sarasini","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Claudia Zierold","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Mariella Calleri","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Alice Bonetti","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Frank A Blocki","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Luca Pallavicini","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Alberto Chinali","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Daniela Campisi","author_inst":"ASST Niguarda Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elena Percivalle","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Anna Pia DiNapoli","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Carlo Federico Perno","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Fausto Balldanti","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Kai Wohlgemuth","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Heymut Omran","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Florian Klein","author_inst":"German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dagmar Wieczorek","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Ortwin Adams","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Carsten Korth","author_inst":"Institute of neuropathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Heiner Schaal","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Torsten Houwaart","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Dilthey","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.105247","rel_title":"A replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus for studies of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell entry and its inhibition","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.105247","rel_abs":"There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat COVID-19.

The key to understanding the biology and virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 requires the knowledge of mutation and evolution of this virus at both inter- and intra-host levels. However, despite quite a few polymorphic sites identified among SARS-CoV-2 populations, intra-host variant spectra and their evolutionary dynamics remain mostly unknown. Here, using deep sequencing data, we achieved and characterized consensus genomes and intra-host genomic variants from 32 serial samples collected from eight patients with COVID-19. The 32 consensus genomes revealed the coexistence of different genotypes within the same patient. We further identified 40 intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs). Most (30\/40) iSNVs presented in single patient, while ten iSNVs were found in at least two patients or identical to consensus variants. Comparison of allele frequencies of the iSNVs revealed genetic divergence between intra-host populations of the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), mostly driven by bottleneck events among intra-host transmissions. Nonetheless, we observed a maintained viral genetic diversity within GIT, showing an increased population with accumulated mutations developed in the tissue-specific environments. The iSNVs identified here not only show spatial divergence of intra-host viral populations, but also provide new insights into the complex virus-host interactions.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yanqun Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Wanying Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Zhaoyong Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Airu Zhu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yongbo Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Yao","author_inst":"Yangjiang People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mian Gan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fang Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ling luo","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sook-san Wong","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jingkai Ji","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chris Mok","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Malik Peiris","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.106294","rel_title":"Deep sequencing of B cell receptor repertoires from COVID-19 patients reveals strong convergent immune signatures","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.106294","rel_abs":"Deep sequencing of B cell receptor (BCR) heavy chains from a cohort of 19 COVID-19 patients from the UK reveals a stereotypical naive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 which is consistent across patients and may be a positive indicator of disease outcome.

There was a strong convergent sequence signature across patients, and we identified 777 clonotypes convergent between at least four of the COVID-19 patients, but not present in healthy controls. A subset of the convergent clonotypes were homologous to known SARS and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralising antibodies. Convergence was also demonstrated across wide geographies by comparison of data sets between patients from UK, USA and China, further validating the disease association and consistency of the stereotypical immune response even at the sequence level. These convergent clonotypes provide a resource to identify potential therapeutic and prophylactic antibodies and demonstrate the potential of BCR profiling as a tool to help understand and predict positive patient responses.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacob D.

In ACE 8\/8 mice that over-expresses cardiac ACE protein but also has no kidney ACE expression, ACE2 protein in kidney membranes was also decreased (38 % of the WT, p<0.01). In kidney membranes from mice that received captopril or telmisartan for 2 weeks there was a reduction in ACE2 protein (37% in captopril treated p<0.01) and 76% in telmisartan treated p <0.05).

As loneliness is recognised as a major public health concern, it is therefore vital that research considers the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on loneliness in order to provide necessary support. But it remains unclear who is lonely in lockdown? Methods: This study compared socio-demographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data from UK adults captured before the pandemic (UK Household Longitudinal Study, n=31,064) and during the pandemic (UCL COVID-19 Social Study, n=60,341). Results: Risk factors for loneliness were near identical prior to and during the pandemic. Young adults, women, people with lower education or income, the economically inactive, people living alone, and urban residents had a higher risk of being lonely. Some people who were already at risk for being lonely (e.g. young adults aged 18-30, people with low household income, and adults living alone) experienced a heightened risk during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to prior to COVID-19 emerging. Further, being a student emerged as a higher risk factor during lockdown than usual. Conclusions: Findings suggest that interventions to reduce or prevent loneliness during COVID-19 should be targeted at those socio-demographic groups already identified as high-risk in previous research. These groups are likely not just to experience loneliness during the pandemic but to have an even higher risk than normal of experiencing loneliness relative to low-risk groups.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feifei Bu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Batlle","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Aleksandr Kovaltsuk","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Gavin J.

It rapidly spread to the rest of the world, and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on the 30th of January 2020. Our understanding of the virus, it is clinical manifestations and treatment options continues to evolve at an unparalleled pace. Objective: This review sought to summarise the key literature regarding transmission, case definitions, clinical management and trials, and performed a systematic review of reported clinical data on COVID-19. Synthesis methods: Two reviewers selected all the literature independently, and extracted information according to pre-defined topics. Results: COVID-19 is pandemic with ~4 million cases and 270,000 deaths in 210 countries as of 8 May 2020. Our review of reports showed that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted via inhalation of respiratory droplets containing the virus and had an incubation period of four to six days. The commonly reported symptoms were fever (80%) and cough (60%) across the spectrum of clinical disease - mild, moderate, severe and critical. Categorization of these cases for home care or hospital management need to be well defined considering the age of the patient and the presence of underlying co-morbidities. The case definitions we reviewed varied among affected countries, which could have contributed to the differences observed in the mean case fatality rates among continents: Oceania (1%), Asia (3%), Africa (4%), South America (5%), North America (6%) and Europe (10%). Asymptomatic cases, which constituted an estimated 80% of COVID-19 cases are a huge threat to control efforts. Conclusion: The presence of fever and cough may be sufficient to warrant a COVID-19 testing but using these symptoms in isolation will miss a proportion of cases. A clear definition of a COVID-19 case is important for managing, treating and tracking clinical illness. While several treatments are in development or in clinical trials for COVID-19, home care of mild\/moderate cases and hospital care for severe and critical cases remain the recommended management for the disease. Quarantine measures and social distancing can help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura McArthur","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."},{"author_name":"DhanaSekaran Sakthivel","author_inst":"ZiP Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia."},{"author_name":"Ricardo Ataide","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia; Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Felicia Chan","author_inst":"Central Clinical School, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."},{"author_name":"Jack S Richards","author_inst":"ZiP Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia.; Burnet Institute f"},{"author_name":"Charles A Narh","author_inst":"ZiP Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia.; Burnet Institute f"},{"author_name":"Ralph Minter","author_inst":"Alchemab Therapeutics Ltd"},{"author_name":"Donna K.

At the same time, oseltamivir, as an over-the-counter drug, is also a popular antiviral drug. As healthcare workers fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have found that many patients experiencing discomfort or considered to be infected with a virus take oseltamivir. From severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and now the current COVID-19 epidemic, there is not plenty of evidence showing that oseltamivir is effective against coronavirus. Still, there is also no sufficient evidence to refute its ineffectiveness. We cannot predict whether there will be a pandemic of respiratory coronavirus in the future, so we hope to initiate such research and preliminarily explore whether oseltamivir is effective for COVID-19, which can better guide healthcare workers in the selection of appropriate antiviral drugs in the face of coronavirus epidemics. If oseltamivir is effective, then a wide promotion of its application often can achieve a double effect with half the effort. If it is not effective, then considering the side effects of oseltamivir, it is not necessary to use unreasonable drugs that will not slow the progression of the disease but can cause adverse reactions. We found that oseltamivir is not suitable for fighting against COVID-19 through the method of computer aided drug design and in vitro study and retrospective case study. Meanwhile it was high-occurrence seasons for the influenza, COVID-19 should be highly suspected in patients who did not benefit from oseltamivir. We hope that the result of our study could be shared with the frontline physicians in fighting against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qi Tan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Disease"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Ataide","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia; Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Felicia Chan","author_inst":"Central Clinical School, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."},{"author_name":"Jack S Richards","author_inst":"ZiP Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia.; Burnet Institute f"},{"author_name":"Charles A Narh","author_inst":"ZiP Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia.; Burnet Institute f"},{"author_name":"Ralph Minter","author_inst":"Alchemab Therapeutics Ltd"},{"author_name":"Donna K.

Methods: An electronic search of the literature compiled studies pertaining to human controlled treatment trials with COVID-19. Medications assessed included lopinavir\/ritonavir, arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, and heparin. Statistical analyzes were performed for common viral clearance endpoints whenever possible. Results: Lopinavir\/ritonavir showed no significant effect on viral clearance for COVID-19 cases (OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.50-1.83]). Hydroxychloroquine also showed no significant effect on COVID-19 viral clearance rates (OR 2.16 [95% CI 0.80-5.84]). Arbidol showed no seven-day (OR 1.63 [95% CI 0.76-3.50]) or 14-day viral (OR 5.37 [95% CI 0.35-83.30]) clearance difference compared to lopinavir\/ritonavir. Review of literature showed no significant clinical improvement with lopinavir\/ritonavir, arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, or remdesivir. Favipiravir showed quicker symptom improvement compared to lopinavir\/ritonavir and arbidol. Heparin showed improvement with severe COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: Current medications do not show significant effect on COVID-19 viral clearance rates. Favipiravir shows favorable results compared to other tested medications. Heparin shows benefit for severe cases of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Arturo Siordia Jr.","author_inst":"Banner University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Bernaba","author_inst":"Banner University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kenji Yoshino","author_inst":"Banner University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Abid Ulhaque","author_inst":"Banner University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sooraj Kumar","author_inst":"Banner University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mario Bernaba","author_inst":"Banner University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Edward Bergin","author_inst":"Banner University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Donna K.

An SEIR compartment model is considered with additional compartments of hospitalized population whose condition is severe or critical and also the fatalities compartment. The basic reproduction number (R_0) is computed by next generation matrix approach and later expressed as a time-dependent function so as to incorporate the NPIs into the model. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are solved using fourth-order and fifth-order Runge-Kutta methods. Different intervention scenarios are considered and results show that, implementation of closure of education insitutions, curfew and partial lockdown yield predicted delayed peaks of the overall infections, severe cases and fatalities and subsequently containement of the pandemic in the country.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Duncan K.
