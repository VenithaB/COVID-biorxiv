Based on the notion of interventions-lifting we classify and evaluate the scenarios by five attributes (indicators): amount of interventions-lifting, death numbers, Public Health Care capacity, population immunity, peak dates of infections. For quantitative reasoning we use a simulated modified SEIR-model calibrated with actual data. We identify margins for intervention-liftings wrt. 13.05.2020 and discuss the relation to the effective reproduction number with a 6d-generation time . We show that, in order to constrain death numbers comparable to a strong Influenza epidemic, there is only a small corridor of 16% of possible liftings, with an additional 4% margin contributed by automated contact tracing. We show also that there is a much broader corridor of 50%+18%, though not overloading critical Public Health Care capacity, implying high death numbers.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Kempf","author_inst":"None"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113340","rel_title":"To isolate, or not to isolate: a theoretical framework for disease control via contact tracing","rel_date":"2020-05-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113340","rel_abs":"Contact tracing is an essential tool in the public health battle for epidemiological control of infectious diseases. Contact tracing via case-by-case interviews is effective when contacts are known and outbreaks are small. Smartphone applications that keep track of contacts between users offer the possibility to scale contact tracing to larger outbreaks with minimal notification delays. While the benefits of reduced delays are widely recognised, it is less well understood how to best implement the tracing and notification protocol. The application will detect a multitude of contacts encountering an individual who later tests positive. Which of these contacts should be advised to self-isolate? The resolution hinges on an inherent trade-off: the more contacts notified, the greater the disease control, at the cost of more healthy individuals being instructed to self-isolate. In this study, based on a compartmental model tailored to the COVID-19 pandemic, we develop a framework to incorporate testing with limited resources coupled with a mechanistic description of digital contact tracing. Specifically, we employ a family of distributions characterising contact exposure and infection risk, and introduce a notification threshold that controls which level of exposure triggers notification. We detail how contact tracing can prevent disease outbreak, as a function of adoption rate, testing limitations, and other intervention methods such as social distancing and lockdown measures. We find an optimal notification threshold that balances the trade-off by minimising the number of healthy individuals instructed to self-isolate while preventing disease outbreak.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davin Lunz","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique"},{"author_name":"Gregory Batt","author_inst":"Inria Paris"},{"author_name":"Jakob Ruess","author_inst":"Inria Paris"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113456","rel_title":"Burden of COVID-19 pandemic in India: Perspectives from Health Infrastructure","rel_date":"2020-05-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113456","rel_abs":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly across the country but testing regime of India is far from the global standards. It is important to identify the states where testing needs expansion and the magnitudes of active COVID cases are higher focusing on current health infrastructure to meet the pandemic. The data on COVID-19 was extracted from the Application Programming Interface. Test positive rate, test per confirmed case, recovery rate, case fatality rate, and percent distribution of active cases were computed. Availability of hospitals, hospital beds, intensive care unit and ventilators per lakh population was also computed by public and private sector. The result revealed that, Maharashtra constitutes more than one-third positive cases in the country. More than a quarter of the active cases in India belonged to the Mumbai district of Maharashtra, followed by the Chennai district (9.4%) and Ahmedabad district (9.1%). Further, about 40 percent of the active cases in India belonged to the 11 districts of Maharashtra. The increased test positive rate in Maharashtra and Gujarat to almost double in last one month is a concern. In order to bring the states and the country in right track, the test positive rate need to be brought down to below 2 percent. The procurement of higher number of high throughput machine, the Cobas 6800 testing machine, is need of the hour. Only few states have adequate health infrastructure. The priority should be the laid on expansion of more laboratories and hospitals, storage of PPE kit, testing kit, and indigenously developed vaccines.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harihar Sahoo","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaitali Mandal","author_inst":"International Institute for the Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Suyash Mishra","author_inst":"International Institute for the Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Snigdha Banerjee","author_inst":"International Institute for the Population Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20112805","rel_title":"The association of UV with rates of COVID-19 transmission and deaths in Mexico: the possible mediating role of vitamin D.","rel_date":"2020-05-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20112805","rel_abs":"The first COVID-19 case in Mexico was confirmed on 26 February 2020 and by May 3 the number of registered cases had risen to 30,927. However the rate of transmission varied greatly from city to city. We used data on temperature, humidity and ultraviolet radiation (UV) from 45 cities all over the country to explore whether there was an association between these variables and rates of transmission and rates of accumulation of COVID-19 ascribed deaths. The advantage of an in-country study of this kind is that many of the variables that can confound international studies are held constant (e.g. public health policies, methods of reporting, cultural, behavioural and genetic factors). Although the official statistics undoubtedly greatly underestimate the situation in Mexico due to lack of testing, they are underestimated in all cities so this should not introduce bias across the sample. We found that temperature and humidity had no discernible association with transmission rates but that UV during the transmission period was negatively correlated with rates of transmission, suggesting a sterilizing effect. UV in the January preceding the epidemic had a slightly higher association with transmission rates than UV during the transmission period itself. We also found negative associations of UV in the transmission period and in January with rate of cumulative deaths, but at lower levels of statistical significance. We conclude that in addition to a sterilizing effect during the transmission period, UV may have a physiological effect in reducing transmission and deaths due to COVID-19, most likely through the medium of vitamin D production in the body. This follows the growing body of medical evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with severity of COVID-19. However, we also found a negative correlation between altitude and rates of COVID-19 transmission, distinct and independent of the UV effect, which may indicate that other physiological processes are also present. In a multiple regression, altitude and UV together accounted for 18% of the variation in transmission rates between cities.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Margaret Skutsch","author_inst":"Centro de Investigaciones en Geografia Ambiental, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Carlos Dobler","author_inst":"Centro de Investigaciones en Geografia Ambiental, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Matthew B.B.

In this study a simple numerical model is used to illustrate the impact the timing of initial measures against Covid-19 has on the first wave of infection and possible implications this may have for the measures taken as the first wave is ebbing. The results highlight that delaying measures by 10 days is sufficient to largely account for the differences seen between countries such as the UK and Germany for the first wave of infections. A pronounced first wave means that a larger fraction of the total population will have been infected and is therefore likely to display immunity. Even if this fraction is far below the level needed for \"herd immunity\" the effective reproduction factor Re is decreased compared to a population that had no prior exposure to the virus. Even a small reduction in Re can have major influence on the evolution of the epidemic after the first wave of infections. A large first wave means the resulting value for Re will be lower than if the first wave was mild. Without either vaccine or effective treatment countries who experienced a small first wave should therefore relax measures at a slightly lower pace than countries where the first wave was strong.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joel Joel-Marie Hirschi","author_inst":"National Oceanography Centre"},{"author_name":"Carlos Dobler","author_inst":"Centro de Investigaciones en Geografia Ambiental, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Matthew B.B.

There were over 4.8 million confirmed cases and about 320,000 deaths as of May 19, 2020 in the world. We examined the characteristics of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in all affected counties of the United States. We proposed a COVID-Net combining the architecture of both Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) by using the trajectories of COVID-19 during different periods until May 19, 2020, as the training data. The validation of the COVID-Net was performed by predicting the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths in subsequent 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day periods. The COVID-Net produced relatively smaller Mean Relative Errors (MREs) for the 10 counties with the most severe epidemic as of May 19, 2020. On average, MREs were 0.01 for the number of confirmed cases in all validation periods, and 0.01, 0.01, and 0.03 for the number of deaths in the 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day periods, respectively. The COVID-Net incorporated five risk factors of COVID-19 and was used to predict the trajectories of COVID-19 in Hudson County, New Jersey and New York County, New York until June 28, 2020. The risk factors include the percentage of the population with access to exercise opportunities, average daily PM2.5, population size, preventable hospitalization rate, and violent crime rate. The expected number of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths depends on the dynamics of these five risk factors.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Tian","author_inst":"School of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yukang Jiang","author_inst":"School of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yuting Zhang","author_inst":"School of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhongfei Li","author_inst":"School of Management, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Wang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Yale University"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Fenner-Sanchez","author_inst":"CESMECA-UNICACH, Geobrujas-comunidad de geografas y Grupo Estepa UNAL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113514","rel_title":"Infoveillance to Analyze Covid19 Impact on Central America Population","rel_date":"2020-05-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113514","rel_abs":"Infoveillance is an application within the Infodemiology field with the aim of monitoring public health and create public policies.

Methods: A deep-learning model (CAPE: Covid-19 AI Predictive Engine) was trained on 2337 CXR images including 2103 used only for validation while training. The prospective test set consisted of CXR images (n=70) obtained from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients between 1 January and 30 April 2020 in a single center. The radiographs were analyzed by the AI model. Model performance was obtained by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: In the prospective test set, the mean age of the patients was 46 (+\/- 16.2) years (84.2% male). The deep-learning model accurately predicted outcomes of ICU admission\/mortality from COVID-19 pneumonia with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.79-0.96). Compared to traditional risk scoring systems for pneumonia based upon laboratory and clinical parameters, the model matched the EWS and MulBTSA risk scoring systems and outperformed CURB-65.

To potentially expand the supply, we validated a rapidly applicable low-cost decontamination protocol in compliance with regulatory standards to enable the safe reuse of personalized, disposable N95-respirators. Methods: Four common models of N95-respirators were disinfected for 60 minutes at 70{degrees}C either at 0% or 50% relative humidity (RH). Effective inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and E. coli was evaluated in inoculated masks. The N95 filter integrity was examined with scanning electron microscopy. The protective function of disinfected N95 respirators was tested against US NIOSH standards for particle filtration efficiency, breathing resistance and respirator fit. Results: A single heat treatment inactivated both SARS-CoV-2 (undetectable, detection limit: 100 TCID50\/ml) and E. coli (0 colonies at 50%RH) in all four respirator models. Even N95-respirators that underwent ten decontamination cycles maintained their integrity and met US governmental criteria for approval regarding fit, filtration efficiency and breathing resistance. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated maintained N95 fiber diameter compared to baseline. Interpretation: Thermal disinfection enables large-scale, low-cost decontamination of existing N95-respirators using commonly sourced equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This process could be used in hospitals and long term care facilities and also provides a feasible approach to expand the N95 supply in low- and middle-income regions.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simeon C.

Crude incident rates for Spaniards and migrants from different areas of the world were estimated. Age and sex-adjusted relative risks for COVID19 were estimated by negative polynomial regression. Setting. University public Hospital at Alcorcon, Madrid, Spain Participants. All adult residents living in Alcorcon classified by their country and region of the world of origin. Main outcome. PCR confirmed COVID-19. Results. PCR confirmed COVID-19 cumulative incidence was 6.81 cases per 1000 inhabitants among residents of Alcorcon. The crude incidence among migrants (n=20419) was higher than among Spaniards (n=131599): 8.81 and 6.51 and per 1000 inhabitants respectively (p<0.001).

For United States, we find that a minimum of 5 months would be required, 22 months for UK, 1 year for Italy and 9 months for Belgium.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward De Brouwer","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Daniele Raimondi","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Yves Moreau","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Ivan Mandel","author_inst":"University Of Pecs Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anita Emoke Hegyi","author_inst":"University of Pecs Medical School"},{"author_name":"Akos Karoly Nagy","author_inst":"University of Pecs Medical School"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Lohinai","author_inst":"Semmelweis University"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Szakacs","author_inst":"University of Pecs Medical School"},{"author_name":"Peter Hegyi","author_inst":"University of Pecs Medical School"},{"author_name":"Martin C.

Unmasking the state-wise variation in the effect of the nationwide lockdown on the progression of the pandemic could inform dynamic policy interventions towards containment and mitigation. Methods Using data on confirmed COVID-19 cases across 20 states that accounted for more than 99% of the cumulative case counts in India till May 31, 2020, we illustrate the masking of state-level trends and highlight the variations across states by presenting evaluative evidence on some aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak: case-fatality rates, doubling times of cases, effective reproduction numbers, and the scale of testing. Results The estimated effective reproduction number R for India was 3.36 (95% confidence interval (CI): [3.03, 3.71]) on March 24, whereas the average of estimates from May 25 - May 31 stands at 1.27 (95% CI: [1.26, 1.28]). Similarly, the estimated doubling time across India was at 3.56 days on March 24, and the past 7-day average for the same on May 31 is 14.37 days. The average daily number of tests have increased from 1,717 (March 19-25) to 131,772 (May 25-31) with an estimated testing shortfall of 4.58 million tests nationally by May 31. However, various states exhibit substantial departures from these national patterns. Conclusions Patterns of change over lockdown periods indicate the lockdown has been effective in slowing the spread of the virus nationally. The COVID-19 outbreak in India displays large state-level variations and identifying these variations can help in both understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and formulating effective public health interventions. Our framework offers a holistic assessment of the pandemic across Indian states and union territories along with a set of interactive visualization tools that are daily updated at covind19.org.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Deepankar Basu","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Salvatore","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Debashree Ray","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Kleinsasser","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Soumik Purkayastha","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Rupam Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Szakacs","author_inst":"University of Pecs Medical School"},{"author_name":"Peter Hegyi","author_inst":"University of Pecs Medical School"},{"author_name":"Martin C.

Such general population control measures could significantly influence perception, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. Here, we assessed KAP towards COVID-19 immediately after the lock-down measures were implemented and during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. Online-based cross-sectional study conducted from March 29 to April 19, 2020, involving Bangladeshi residents aged 12-64 years, recruited via social media. After consenting, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables, perception, and KAP towards COVID-19. Of the 2017 survey participants, 59.8% were male, the majority were students (71.2%), aged 21-30 years (57.9%), having a bachelor's degree (61.0%), having family income >30,000 BDT (50.0%), and living in urban areas (69.8). The survey revealed that 48.3% of participants had more accurate knowledge, 62.3% had more positive attitudes, and 55.1% had more frequent practices regarding COVID-19 prevention. Majority (96.7%) of the participants agreed COVID-19 is a dangerous disease, almost all (98.7%) participants wore a face mask in crowded places, 98.8% agreed to report a suspected case to health authorities, and 93.8% implemented washing hands with soap and water. In multiple logistic regression analyses, COVID-19 more accurate knowledge was associated with age and residence. Sociodemographic factors such as being older, higher education, employment, monthly family income >30,000 BDT, and having more frequent prevention practices were the more positive attitude factors. More frequent prevention practice factors were associated with female sex, older age, higher education, family income > 30,000 BDT, urban area residence, and having more positive attitudes. To improve KAP of general populations is crucial during the rapid rise period of a pandemic outbreak such as COVID-19. Therefore, development of effective health education programs that incorporate considerations of KAP-modifying factors is needed.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Most.

While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis,5 these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models. Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2 replication and drive pathologic responses. Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds. This represents a much-needed platform for rapidly testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Goldman-Israelow","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eric Song","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tianyang Mao","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Lu","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amit Meir","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Feimei Liu","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mia Madel Alfajaro","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jin Wei","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Huiping Dong","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Homer","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aaron Ring","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig B Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Leo L.M.

The test measures the capacity of serum or purified antibodies to neutralize a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. This recombinant virus (VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT) induces fusion in Vero cell monolayers, which is detected as luciferase signal using a dual split protein (DSP) reporter system. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT infection was blocked by monoclonal -SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies and by plasma or serum from SARS-CoV-2 convalescing individuals. The assay exhibited 100% specificity in validation tests, and across all tests zero false positives were detected. In blinded analyses of 230 serum samples, only two unexpected results were observed based on available clinical data. We observed a perfect correlation between results from our assay and 80 samples that were also assayed using a commercially available ELISA. To quantify the magnitude of the anti-viral response, we generated a calibration curve by adding stepped concentrations of -SARS-CoV-2-spike monoclonal antibody to pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum. Using the calibration curve and a single optimal 1:100 serum test dilution, we reliably measured neutralizing antibody levels in each test sample. Virus neutralization units (VNUs) calculated from the assay correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with PRNTEC50 values determined by plaque reduction neutralization test against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the IMMUNO-COV assay accurately quantitates SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in human sera and therefore is a potentially valuable addition to the currently available serological tests. The assay can provide vital information for comparing immune responses to the various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in development, or for evaluating donor eligibility in convalescent plasma therapy studies.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rianna Vandergaast","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Timothy Carey","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Samantha Reiter","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Patrycja Lech","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Clement Gnanadurai","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mulu Tesfay","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jason Buehler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lukkana Suksanpaisan","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shruthi Naik","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Bethany Brunton","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jordan Recker","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Michelle Haselton","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Christopher Ziegler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Anne Roesler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"John R.

The study of differentially expressed genes in case-control cohorts of patients is often the first step in understanding the details of the cells dysregulation. A further level of analysis is introduced by noticing that genes are organized in functional modules (often called pathways), thus their action and their dysregulation may be better understood by the identification of the modules most affected by the disease (aka disease modules, or active subnetworks). We describe how an algorithm based on the Core&Peel method developed originally for detecting protein complexes in PPI networks, can be adapted to detect disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. We first validate Core&Peel for the easier general task of functional module detection by comparison with 42 methods participating in the Disease Module Identification DREAM challenge of 2019. Next, we use four specific disease test cases (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis), four state-of-the-art algorithms (ModuleDiscoverer, Degas, KeyPathwayMiner and ClustEx), and several pathway databases to validate the proposed algorithm. Core&Peel is the only method able to find significant associations of the predicted disease module with known validated relevant pathways for all four diseases. Moreover for the two cancer data sets, Core&Peel detects further nine relevant pathways enriched in the predicted disease module, not discovered by the other methods used in the comparative analysis. Finally we apply Core&Peel, along with other methods, to explore the transcriptional response of human cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, at a modular level, aiming at finding supporting evidence for drug repositioning efforts.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marta Lucchetta","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Siena, Siena, Italy."},{"author_name":"Marco Pellegrini","author_inst":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche"},{"author_name":"Samantha Reiter","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Patrycja Lech","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Clement Gnanadurai","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mulu Tesfay","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jason Buehler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lukkana Suksanpaisan","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shruthi Naik","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Bethany Brunton","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jordan Recker","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Michelle Haselton","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Christopher Ziegler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Anne Roesler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"John R.

Unfortunately, traditional drug discovery methods have a >90% failure rate and can take 10-15 years from target identification to clinical use. In contrast, drug repurposing can significantly accelerate translation. We developed a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify efficacious single agents and combination therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Quantitative high-content morphological profiling was coupled with an AI-based machine learning strategy to classify features of cells for infection and stress. From a library of 1,425 FDA-approved compounds and clinical candidates, we identified 17 dose-responsive compounds with antiviral efficacy. In particular, we discovered that lactoferrin is an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection with an IC50 of 308 nM and that it potentiates the efficacy of both remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine. Lactoferrin also stimulates an antiviral host cell response and retains inhibitory activity in iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial cells, a model for the primary site of infection. Given its safety profile in humans, these data suggest that lactoferrin is a readily translatable therapeutic option for COVID-19. Additionally, several commonly prescribed drugs were found to exacerbate viral infection and warrant follow up studies. We conclude that morphological profiling for drug repurposing is an effective strategy for the selection and optimization of drugs and drug combinations as viable therapeutic options for COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carmen Mirabelli","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Jesse W.

Although the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is about 1 % of the global population and RA patients naturally have a chance of acquiring COVID-19 in this pandemic, no studies have considered the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (a receptor for SARS-CoV-2) in synovial tissues.

Little is known about the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific pre-existing memory T cells in human. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS\/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9\/18) possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to \"common cold\" human coronaviruses but conserved among animal betacoranaviruses.\n\nThus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP. Understanding how pre-existing ORF-1-specific T cells present in the general population impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nina Le Bert","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anthony Tanoto Tan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Kamini Kunasegaran","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christine Y.

Proposed mechanisms involve host cell membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as transmembrane serine protease isoform 2 (TMPRSS2). The distribution of expression of these genes across cell types representing multiple organ systems in healthy individuals has been recently demonstrated. However, comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated with worse outcomes. Whether these conditions contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence remain unclear. Here we show that the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other viral entry-related genes are modulated in target organs of select disease states. In tissues such as heart, which normally express ACE2 but minimal TMPRSS2, we found that TMPRSS2 as well as other TTSPs are elevated in individuals with comorbidities vs healthy individuals. Additionally, we found increased expression of viral entry-related genes in the settings of hypertension, cancer or smoking across target organ systems. Our results demonstrate that common comorbidities may contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and suggest new therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua D Breidenbach","author_inst":"University of Toledo"},{"author_name":"Prabhatchandra Dube","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Subhanwita Ghosh","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Nikolai N Modyanov","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Deepak Malhotra","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Lance D Dworkin","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Steven T Haller","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"David J Kennedy","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Nicole Tan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Martin Linster","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Wan Ni Chia","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mark I-Cheng Chen","author_inst":"National Center of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Eng Eong Ooi","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Shirin Kalimuddin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paul Anantharajal Tambyah","author_inst":"Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jenny Guek-Hong Low","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Yee-Joo Tan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Antonio Bertoletti","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Aaron Keely","author_inst":"Hungarian Academy of Sciences  Research Centre for Natural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gy\u00f6rgy M Keser\u00fc","author_inst":"Hungarian Academy of Sciences Research Centre for Natural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hanna F Klein","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Matthew P Martin","author_inst":"Cancer Research UK Drug Discovery Unit, Newcastle University Centre for Cancer"},{"author_name":"Martin E.M.

Despite the implementation of new automated detection systems, and previous efficiencies such as barcoding, electronic data transfer and extensive robotics, throughput capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to further address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in a clinical setting is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly the risk of false negative results when weak positive samples are pooled. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with extensive assessment of pools containing weak positive specimens. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of weak positive samples across ten weeks of the pandemic were reviewed. Weak positive specimens were detected in all five-sample pools but failed to be detected in four of the 24 nine-sample pools tested. Weak positive samples comprised an average 16.5% of the positive specimens tested during the pandemic thus far, slightly increasing in frequency during later weeks. Other aspects of the testing process should be considered, however, such as accessioning and reporting, which are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures. Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to implementing such a strategy.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsten St. George","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center - NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Sara B.

As a result, the clinical outcome from previous CQ or HCQ trials were, in fact, the collective manifestation of both R and S- enantiomers with inherent different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and toxicity liabilities. Our data for the first time demonstrated the stereoselective difference of CQ and HCQ against live SARS-CoV-2 virus in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. S-chloroquine (S-CQ) and S-hydroxychloroquine (S-HCQ) significantly more active against SARS-CoV-2, as compared to R-CQ and R-HCQ, respectively. In addition, Mpro, as one of the critical enzymes for viral transcription and replication, also exhibited an enantioselective binding affinity toward the S-enantiomers. The most significant finding from this study is the pronounced difference of the two enantiomers of CQ and HCQ observed in hERG inhibition assay. The IC50 value of S-HCQ was higher than 20 M against hERG channel, which was much less active over all tested CQ and HCQ compounds. Moreover, S-HCQ alone did not prolong QT interval in guinea pigs after 3 days and 6 days of administration, indicating a much lower cardiac toxicity potential. With these and previous findings on the enantio-differentiated metabolism, we recommend that future clinical studies should employ S-HCQ, substantially free of the R-enantiomer, to potentially improve the therapeutic index for the treatment of COVID-19 over the racemic CQ and HCQ.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guanguan Li","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing Sun","author_inst":"GIRH"},{"author_name":"Yi-You Huang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Yingjun Li","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yongjie Shi","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhe Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Animals & Cardiovascular Model Research Center, Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute"},{"author_name":"Feng Hua Yang","author_inst":"Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Animals & Cardiovascular Model Research Center, Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"GIRH"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin LUO","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Tony Y.

This disease is caused by a newly discovered strain of the coronavirus, namely SARS CoV-2. Lung cancer patients are reported to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. To evaluate the probable reasons behind the excessive susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients to COVID-19 infection, we targeted two most crucial biomarkers of COVID-19, ACE2 and CXCL10. ACE2 plays a vital role in the SARS CoV-2 entry into the host cell while CXCL10 is a cytokine mainly responsible for the lung cell damage involving in a cytokine storm.\n\nMethodsFirstly, we used the TIMER, UALCAN and GEPIA2 databases to analyze the expression and correlation of ACE2 and CXCL10 in LUAD and LUSC. After that, using the cBioPortal database, we performed an analytical study to determine the genetic changes in ACE2 and CXCL10 protein sequences that are responsible for lung cancer development. Finally, we analyzed different functional approaches of ACE2, CXCL10 and their co-expressed genes associated with lung cancer and COVID-19 development by using the PANTHER database.\n\nResultsInitially, we observed that ACE2 and CXCL10 are mostly overexpressed in LUAD and LUSC. We also found the functional significance of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer development by determining the genetic alteration frequency in their amino acid sequences. Lastly, by doing the functional assessment of the targeted genes, we identified that ACE2 and CXCL10 along with their commonly co-expressed genes are respectively involved in the binding activity and immune responses in case of lung cancer and COVID-19 infection.\n\nConclusionsFinally, on the basis of this systemic analysis, we came to the conclusion that ACE2 and CXCL10 are possible biomarkers responsible for the higher susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients towards the COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tousif Bin Mahmood","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali-3814, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Afrin Sultana Chowdhury","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali-3814, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mehedee Hasan","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali-3814, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

Methods: Systematic review in five engines, pre-print webpages and RCT registries until May 22, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating remdesivir on confirmed, COVID-19 adults with pneumonia and\/or respiratory insufficiency. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, clinical improvement or recovery, need for invasive ventilation, and serious adverse events (SAE). Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, progression of pneumonia, and adverse events (AE). Inverse variance random effects meta-analyses were performed. Results: Two placebo-controlled RCTs (n=1300) and two case series (n=88) were included. All studies used remdesivir 200mg IV the first day and 100mg IV for 9 more days, and followed up until 28 days. Wang et al. RCT was stopped early due to AEs; ACTT-1 was preliminary reported at 15-day follow up. Time to clinical improvement was not decreased in Wang et al. RCT, but median time to recovery was decreased by 4 days in ACTT-1. Remdesivir did not decrease all-cause mortality (RR 0.71, 95%CI 0.39 to 1.28) and need for invasive ventilation at 14 days (RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.23 to 1.42), but had fewer SAEs (RR 0.77, 95%CI 0.63 to 0.94). AEs were similar between remdesivir and placebo arms. Risk of bias ranged from some concerns to high risk in RCTs. Interpretation: There is paucity of adequately powered and fully reported RCTs evaluating effects of remdesivir in adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir should not be recommended for the treatment of severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alejandro Piscoya","author_inst":"Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola"},{"author_name":"Luis F.

To better understand the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, we have used real-time mobility data to modify the DELPHI Epidemiological Model recently developed at M.I.T., to simulate the pandemic in Metro Manila. We have chosen to focus on the National Capital Region, not only because it is the nation's demographic heart where over a tenth of the country's population live, but also because it has been the epidemiological epicenter of the Philippine pandemic. Our model suggests that the government-imposed enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) has successfully limited the spread of the pandemic. It is clear that the initial wave of the pandemic is flattening, though suppression of viral spread has been delayed by the local pandemics in the City of Manila and Quezon City. Our data also reveals that replacing the ECQ with a General Community Quarantine (GCQ) will increase the forecasted number of deaths in the nation's capital unless rigorous tracing and testing can be implemented to prevent a second wave of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bernhard Egwolf","author_inst":"University of Santo Tomas"},{"author_name":"Nicanor Austriaco","author_inst":"Providence College"},{"author_name":"Angela Parra del Riego","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas"},{"author_name":"Renato Cerna-Viacava","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas"},{"author_name":"Vinay Pasupuleti","author_inst":"MedErgy Health Group Inc."},{"author_name":"Yuani M Roman","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Priyaleela Thota","author_inst":"Hemex Health Inc."},{"author_name":"C.

The Portuguese people complied quickly, reducing their overall mobility by 80% . We estimate the impact of the lockdown in Portugal in terms of reducing burden on the health service. Methods: Using publicly available official data from the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health we forecasted epidemic curves for: Cases, hospital inpatients (overall and in ICU), and deaths without lockdown, assuming that the impact of containment measures would start 14 days after lockdown was implemented. We used exponential smoothing models for deaths, intensive care (ICU) and hospitalizations and an ARIMA model for number of cases. Models were selected considering fitness to the observed data to the 31st of March 2020. We then compared observed(with intervention) and forecasted curves( without intervention). Results: Between April 1 and April 15, there were 146 fewer deaths(-25%), 5568 fewer cases (-23%) and, as of April 15, there were 519 fewer ICU inpatients(-69%) and 508 fewer overall hospital inpatients(-28%) than forecasted without lockdown. On April 15 the number of ICU inpatients could have reached 748, three times higher than the observed value (229) if the intervention had been delayed. Conclusion: If the lockdown had not been implemented in mid-March, Portugal ICU capacity (528 ICU beds) would likely have been breached in the first half of April. The lockdown seems to have been effective in reducing transmission of SARS-Cov-2, serious Covid-19 illness and associated mortality, thereby decreasing demand on health services. Early action allowed time for the National Health Service to acquire protective equipment, to increase capacity to test and cope with the surge in hospital and ICU demand caused by the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasco Ricoca Peixoto","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Andre Vieira","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Pedro Aguiar","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Carlos Carvalho","author_inst":"Unit for Multidisciplinary Research in Biomedicine, Abel Salazar Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Universidade do Porto, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Daniel Thomas","author_inst":"Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, Public Health Wales, Cardiff, UK"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Abrantes","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Priyaleela Thota","author_inst":"Hemex Health Inc."},{"author_name":"C.
