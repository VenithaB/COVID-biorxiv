Here we statistically estimated the time-delay adjusted death risk for Wuhan as well as for China excluding Wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China. We found that the latest estimates of the death risk in Wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it ~1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. Because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical\/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenji Mizumoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.20.20025866","rel_title":"Estimating the Asymptomatic Ratio of 2019 Novel Coronavirus onboard the Princess Cruises Ship, 2020","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.20.20025866","rel_abs":"The potential infectiousness of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases together with a substantial fraction of asymptomatic infections among all infections, have been highlighted in clinical studies.

The demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics. Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens. CRISPR-nCoV demonstrated a near single-copy sensitivity and great clinical sensitivity with a shorter turn-around time than RT-PCR. Conclusion: CRISPR-nCoV presents as a promising diagnostic option for the emerging pathogen.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tieying Hou","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Weiqi Zeng","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Minling Yang","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Chen","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd, Guangzhou"},{"author_name":"Lili Ren","author_inst":"National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens; Christophe M\u00e9rieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathoge"},{"author_name":"Jingwen Ai","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Huashan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China"},{"author_name":"Ji Wu","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Yalong Liao","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Xuejing Gou","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Yongjun Li","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaorui Wang","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Hang Su","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Gu","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Teng Xu","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd, 31 Kefeng Rd, G10-301, Guangzhou 510000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.20.20025536","rel_title":"Clinical characteristics of 51 patients discharged from hospital with COVID-19 in Chongqing\uff0cChina","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.20.20025536","rel_abs":"Abstract BackgroundSince December 2019, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2)-infected disease (Coronavirus Disease 2019COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan , Chinaand rapidly spread throughout Chinaeven throughout the world. We try to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in non-Wuhan areaand explore its effective treatment. MethodsRetrospective, single-center case series of the 51 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital in Chongqing, China, from January 20 to February 3, 2020The discharge time was from January 29 to February 11, 2020. The main results and indicators of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment data of 51 patients with covid-19 were collected and analyzed. The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients). Results Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43(84.3%)patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhanand 4(7.7%) patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 4(7.7%) patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%])Local consolidation of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%])all of them received aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]). 10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment. Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older (median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4 [57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%], most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%])most of them needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P <0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13). ConclusionIn 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and astheniaSome patients had obvious dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease. For the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to oxygen inhalation and antiviral treatment, attention should be paid to the dialectical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, regulation of intestinal flora, nutritional support treatment and other comprehensive treatment.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"liu lei","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gao Jian-ya","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Minling Yang","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Chen","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd, Guangzhou"},{"author_name":"Lili Ren","author_inst":"National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens; Christophe M\u00e9rieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathoge"},{"author_name":"Jingwen Ai","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Huashan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China"},{"author_name":"Ji Wu","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Yalong Liao","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Xuejing Gou","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Yongjun Li","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaorui Wang","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Hang Su","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Gu","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Teng Xu","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd, 31 Kefeng Rd, G10-301, Guangzhou 510000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.20.20025593","rel_title":"The efficacy of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.20.20025593","rel_abs":"Background.

However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza. Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza. Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; p = 0.87; I2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels and decreasing influenza B virus loads and cytokines after convalescent plasma treatment. No serious adverse events was reported between two groups. Studies were commonly of low risk of bias with high quality. Conclusions. Convalescent plasma appears safe but may not reduce mortality in severe influenza. This therapy should be studied within the context of a well designed clinical trial for treatment of SARS Cov 2 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhiheng Xu","author_inst":"State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Chin"},{"author_name":"Jianmeng Zhou","author_inst":"State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Chin"},{"author_name":"Yongbo Huang","author_inst":"State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Chin"},{"author_name":"Xuesong Liu","author_inst":"State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Chin"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Chin"},{"author_name":"Sibei Chen","author_inst":"State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Chin"},{"author_name":"Dongdong Liu","author_inst":"State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Chin"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Lin","author_inst":"State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Chin"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Liu","author_inst":"State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Chin"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Chin"},{"author_name":"Xiaorui Wang","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Hang Su","author_inst":"Vision Medicals, Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Gu","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Teng Xu","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd, 31 Kefeng Rd, G10-301, Guangzhou 510000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.20.20025973","rel_title":"Assessing the impact of a symptom-based mass screening and testing intervention during a novel infectious disease outbreak: The case of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.20.20025973","rel_abs":"A symptom-based mass screening and testing intervention (MSTI) can identify a large fraction of infected individuals during an infectious disease outbreak.

Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P > 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P < 0.05). Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhichao Feng","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qizhi Yu","author_inst":"First Hospital of Changsha; Changsha Public Health Treatment Center"},{"author_name":"Shanhu Yao","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Lei Luo","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junhong Duan","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Yan","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Hongpei Tan","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mengtian Ma","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Ting Li","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Dali Yi","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Ze Mi","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Huafei Zhao","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yi Jiang","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhenhu He","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Huiling Li","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Nie","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yin Liu","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhao","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Muqing Luo","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuanhui Liu","author_inst":"Second People Hospital of Hunan"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Rong","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.19.20025023","rel_title":"The cross-sectional study of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients in Xiangyang, Hubei province","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.19.20025023","rel_abs":"Summary Objective To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized patients and to offer suggestions to the urgent needs of COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed. Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe\/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.

Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 ORF 1ab from 5 cases with CRF. Interpretation Acute renal impairment was uncommon in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause obvious acute renal injury, or aggravate CRF in the COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lunwen Wang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious Diseases, Hubei Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shaonan Yan","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dong Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zuojiong Gong","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shengduo Polo Pei","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bowen Tang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Shuai Yuan","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lisha Wang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Huang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhenhu He","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Huiling Li","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Nie","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yin Liu","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhao","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Muqing Luo","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuanhui Liu","author_inst":"Second People Hospital of Hunan"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Rong","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.20.20025841","rel_title":"Breadth of concomitant immune responses underpinning viral clearance and patient recovery in a non-severe case of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.20.20025841","rel_abs":"We report the kinetics of the immune response in relation to clinical and virological features of a patient with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) requiring hospitalisation.

Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation: The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhiliang Hu","author_inst":"Nanjing Infectious Disease Center, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Ci Song","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Chuanjun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Guangfu Jin","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Yaling Chen","author_inst":"Nanjing Infectious Disease Center, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Xin Xu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Hongxia Ma","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Research Center, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Yuan Lin","author_inst":"Department of Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Yishan Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Critical Medicine, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Jianming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"zhibin hu","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yongxiang Yi","author_inst":"Nanjing Infectious Disease Center, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210003, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbing Shen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China."},{"author_name":"Zhenhu He","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Huiling Li","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Nie","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yin Liu","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhao","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Muqing Luo","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuanhui Liu","author_inst":"Second People Hospital of Hunan"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Rong","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.18.20024281","rel_title":"Phase adjusted estimation of the number of 2019 novel coronavirus cases in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.18.20024281","rel_abs":"An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV \/ SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huwen Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Zezhou Wang","author_inst":"Department of Cancer Prevention, Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University; Department of oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200025, "},{"author_name":"Yinqiao Dong","author_inst":"Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang 110122, China"},{"author_name":"Ruijie Chang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Chen Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Shuxian Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Lhakpa Tsamlag","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Meili Shang","author_inst":"Sanlin Community Health Service Center, Shanghai 200124, China"},{"author_name":"Jinyan Huang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine (Shanghai), Rui-Jin Hospital, Sh"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Tian Shen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Xinxin Zhang","author_inst":"Research Laboratory of Clinical Virology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine (Shanghai)c, Rui-Jin Hospital, and Rui-Jin Hospital North, Shangha"},{"author_name":"Yong Cai","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China"},{"author_name":"Huiling Li","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Nie","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yin Liu","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhao","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Muqing Luo","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuanhui Liu","author_inst":"Second People Hospital of Hunan"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Rong","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.19.20025148","rel_title":"Trends and prediction in daily incidence of novel coronavirus infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City: an application of Farr law","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.19.20025148","rel_abs":"Background: The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected tens of thousands of patients in China. Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr law is a classic epidemiology theory\/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models. Conclusions: This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing. However, there is a possibility of upward trend.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yajiao Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wei V.

It may give the public some scientific information to ease the fear of the epidemic. Objective: In December 2019, pneumonia infected with the novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. We aimed to use a mathematical model to predict number of diagnosed patients in future to ease anxiety on the emergent situation. Design: According to all diagnosis number from WHO website and combining with the transmission mode of infectious diseases, the mathematical model was fitted to predict future trend of outbreak. Setting: Our model was based on the epidemic situation in China, which could provide referential significance for disease prediction in other countries, and provide clues for prevention and intervention of relevant health authorities. Participants: In this retrospective, all diagnosis number from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020 reported from China was included and downloaded from WHO website. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We develop a simple but accurate formula to predict the next day diagnosis number:N_i\/N_(i-1) =[(N_(i-1)\/N_(i-2) )]^where Ni is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, and  was estimated as 0.904 at Feb 10. Results: Based on this model, it is predicted that the rate of disease infection will decrease exponentially. The total number of infected people is limited; thus, the disease will have limited impact. However, new diagnosis will last to March. Conclusions and Relevance: Through the establishment of our model, we can better predict the trend of the epidemic in China.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessia Lai","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences \"L.

This study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors. Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regressions were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem. Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people (P<0.001). Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality (P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and times to focus on the COVID-19 ([&ge;] 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were associated with poor sleep quality. Conclusions: Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Young people, people who spent too much time on the epidemic, and healthcare workers were at high risk for mental illness. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yeen Huang","author_inst":"The 6th Affiliated hospital of Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Nanshan Hospital Affiliated to Shenzhen University Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ning Zhao","author_inst":"The 6th Affiliated hospital of Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Nanshan Hospital Affiliated to Shenzhen University Shenzhen, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Carla Acciarri","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences \"L.

Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries.

Diagnostic test based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy. Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay. Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum.

Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets. According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with 2019-nCoV than healthy people. Our data may provide a theoretical basis for the classification and management of future 2019-nCoV susceptibility people in clinical application.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haoyan Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Baoqin Xuan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes,Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University."},{"author_name":"Yuqing Yan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Chaoqin Shen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Gang Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Linhua Ji","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Danhua Xu","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hua Xiong","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Disease; Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University."},{"author_name":"TaChung Yu","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Li","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Disease; Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yingxuan Chen","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Disease; Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yun Cui","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Disease; Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Jie Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"gastroenterology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.20.20025338","rel_title":"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Immediate Psychological Impact on 5062 Health Workers","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.20.20025338","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (HWs). We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of working> 10 years (HR, 2.02; P<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (HR, 1.51; P<0.001), history of mental disorders (HR, 3.27; P<0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (HR, 1.23; P=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [OR], 0.76; P=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (OR, 0.69; P=0.004) were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological protective measures implemented by the hospital could be helpful.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhou Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shabei Xu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zheng Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Guo Li","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jinfeng Miao","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chenyan Zhang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuan Yang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Suiqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yebin Fan","author_inst":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Hu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.21.20026146","rel_title":"Public Exposure to Live Animals, Behavioural Change, and Support in Containment Measures in response to COVID-19 Outbreak: a population-based cross sectional survey in China","rel_date":"2020-02-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.21.20026146","rel_abs":"Background In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures. Methods A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities. Findings Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119\/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102\/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0.001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p<0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P<0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures. Interpretation The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Hou","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Leesa Lin","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Development Faculty of Public Health and Policy London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liang Lu","author_inst":"West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxing Du","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Liang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yuan Yang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Suiqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yebin Fan","author_inst":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Hu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.16.951913","rel_title":"Single cell RNA sequencing of 13 human tissues identify cell types and receptors of human coronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-02-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.16.951913","rel_abs":"The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors\/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted \"CellPhoneDB\" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Leesa Lin","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Development Faculty of Public Health and Policy London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liang Lu","author_inst":"West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxing Du","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Liang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yuan Yang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Suiqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yebin Fan","author_inst":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Hu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.17.951939","rel_title":"Protection of Rhesus Macaque from SARS-Coronavirus challenge by recombinant adenovirus vaccine","rel_date":"2020-02-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.17.951939","rel_abs":"A recombinant adenovirus vaccine against the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was constructed, which contains fragments from the S, N, and Orf8 genes.

With the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019-nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was shown that the RBD-ACE2 binding free energy for 2019-nCoV is significantly lower than that for SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiahua He","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huanyu Tao","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yumeng Yan","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng-You Huang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hua Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Linlin Bao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tong Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Suiqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yebin Fan","author_inst":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Hu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.20.958272","rel_title":"A Multiscale and Comparative Model for Receptor Binding of 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the Implication of its Life Cycle in Host Cells","rel_date":"2020-02-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.20.958272","rel_abs":"The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhaoqian Su","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yinghao Wu","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yumeng Yan","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng-You Huang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hua Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Linlin Bao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tong Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Suiqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yebin Fan","author_inst":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Hu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jihong Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing-Yuan Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Oncogenes and Related Genes; Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Ministry of Health; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepa"},{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghong Ding","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Przemyslaw Porebski","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Pyrros A Telionis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Richard Beckman","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hoops","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Eubank","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Young Yun Baek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Chris Barrett","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"}]}
