A newer strain is made to emerge in the population when a preexisting strain has reached equilibrium. We assume that this newer strain does not exhibit cross-immunity with the original strain, hence those who are vaccinated and recovered from the original strain become susceptible to the newer strain. Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus demonstrates that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available for some of its strains, is active in a population. We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability. The reproduction number was also determined for the epidemiological model and found to be consistent with the local stability condition for the disease-free equilibrium.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel Fudolig","author_inst":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Reka Howard","author_inst":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20039065","rel_title":"Optimization of Microbiological Laboratory Detection Strategy for Patients in A Designated Hospital Treating Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in Anhui Province","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20039065","rel_abs":"Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is an emerging, highly contagious community acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Highly efficient and accurate microbiological laboratory assay is essential to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection, rule out other pathogens that can cause CAP, and monitor secondary infections. Here, we enrolled and provide microbiological analysis for 129 suspected and 52 transferred confirmed NCP patients hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from Jan 21 to Feb 29, 2020. By analyzing the dual swab samples (sputum and pharyngeal) from 129 suspected patients with realtime RT-PCR, we confirmed 33 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with two co-infection cases with adenovirus or rhinovirus. We also used multiplex PCR to detect 13 common respiratory tract pathogens in 96 non-NCP patients, and found that 30 patients (31.25%) were infected with at least one respiratory tract pathogen that may cause CAP. Further, we performed bacterial and fungal cultures as well as fungal serologic tests and found that there is no secondary bacterial\/fungal infections in confirmed NCP patients. Our studies suggest that, during the epidemic of NCP in Anhui province, there was a certain proportion of infection and co-infection of other common pathogens of CAP, and the secondary bacterial and fungal infection is not detectable in NCP patients. In comparison with SARS-CoV-2 detection alone, this optimized strategy combining multiple pathogen detection for identification of NCP and other CAP patients as well as cultures and serologic tests for confirmed patients increases the diagnosis efficiency and facilitates the personalized medication.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenjiao Chang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Yuru Shi","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Yingjie Qi","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Ting Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Zhaowu Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Wenjing Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Mengmeng Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Dongfeng Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Ming Yin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Jing Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Zhu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Jing Ge","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Shu Zhu","author_inst":"Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Ma","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.20.20039024","rel_title":"COVID-19: Modelling Local Transmission and Morbidity effects to provide an estimate of overall Relative Healthcare Resource Impact by General Practice Granularity","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.20.20039024","rel_abs":"Introduction Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. Methods Two key factors were analysed which when multiplied together would give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. These factors were case incidence and case morbidity. GP Practice data was used as this provided the most geographically granular source of published public population data. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, % age >16 at fulltime work\/education, % age over 60, % BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD 2019, Location as latitude\/longitude, and patient engagement as % self-confident in their own long term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated by applying the international mortality Odds Ratio to the local population relevant age and disease prevalences and then summing and dividing by the equivalent national figure. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. Results The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation with the significance of specific factors moderating over time as the balance between external infection, community transmission and impact of mitigation measures feeds through to the number of cases. It showed that currently Urban, % Working and age >60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative HC impact was wide with 80% of practices falling between 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included it showed that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England. Conclusion Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health and social care resources across the country. This model provides a method for predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria and thereby providing a method for targeting limited (and perhaps soon to be scarce) care resources to optimise national, regional and local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Stedman","author_inst":"Res Consortium"},{"author_name":"Mark Lunt","author_inst":"Musculoskeletal & Dermatological Sciences, University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Mark Davies","author_inst":"Res Consortium"},{"author_name":"Martin Gibson","author_inst":"Diabetes and Endocrinology, Salford Royal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Adrian Heald","author_inst":"Diabetes and Endocrinology, Salford Royal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaowu Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Wenjing Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Mengmeng Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Dongfeng Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Ming Yin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Jing Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Zhu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Jing Ge","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Shu Zhu","author_inst":"Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Ma","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.19.20039347","rel_title":"Basic and effective reproduction numbers of COVID-19 cases in South Korea excluding Sincheonji cases","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.19.20039347","rel_abs":"In February and March 2020, COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea met a large black swan effect by a Sincheonji cult mass infection in Daegu-Gyeongbuk area.

Therefore, antibodies produced in COVID-19 and SARS patients should not be that dissimilar. We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM & IgG) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the IIFA IgM test was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity. Conclusions: Existing diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. These assays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in epidemiological investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new emerging virus pending the availability of specific serology tests for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Yee Wan","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Siew Hoon Lim","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eng Hong Seng","author_inst":"SIngapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiwon Jung","author_inst":"Asan Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Namkug Kim","author_inst":"Asan Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhaowu Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Wenjing Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Mengmeng Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Dongfeng Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Ming Yin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Jing Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Zhu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Jing Ge","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Shu Zhu","author_inst":"Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Ma","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20035246","rel_title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen, the largest migrant city of China","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20035246","rel_abs":"We conducted a retrospective study among 417 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 1 to Feb 28, 2020 in Shenzhen, the largest migrant city of China, to identify the epidemiological and clinical features in settings of high population mobility.

In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65*109\/L vs. 0.76*109\/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg\/L vs. 18.13 mg\/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesionswithin 7 days. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kai

The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in cases, the magnitude of the epidemic peak, and the outbreak duration were obtained. Findings The application of all four social distancing interventions: school closure, workplace non-attendance, increased case isolation, and community contact reduction is highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve, reducing the maximum daily case numbers, and lengthening outbreak duration. These were also found to be effective even after 10 weeks delay from index case arrivals. The most effective single intervention was found to be increasing case isolation, to 100 percent of children and 90 percent of adults. Interpretation As strong social distancing intervention strategies had the most effect in reducing the epidemic peak, this strategy may be considered when weaker strategies are first tried and found to be less effective. Questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures, given they are highly disruptive to society. Tradeoffs may need to be made between the effectiveness of social distancing strategies and population willingness to adhere to them.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George J

pandemic has led to unprecedented strain on intensive care unit (ICU) admission in parts of the world. Strategies to create surge ICU capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. Theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such difficult, costly and ethically challenging decisions. At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. Here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14 day horizon. Our model is designed to be parsimonious and based on plausible epidemiological data from the literature available. On the basis of the modelling assumptions made, ICU occupancy is likely to increase dramatically in the the days following the time of modelling. If the current exponential growth continues, 5 out of 7 commissioning regions will have more critically ill COVID-19 patients than there are ICU beds within two weeks\\todo{last thing to do}. Despite variable growth in absolute patients, all commissioning regions are forecast to be heavily burdened under the assumptions used. Whilst, like any forecast model, there remain uncertainties both in terms of model specification and robust epidemiological data in this early prospective phase, it would seem that surge capacity will be required in the very near future. We hope that our model will help policy decision makers with their preparations. The uncertainties in the data highlight the urgent need for ongoing real-time surveillance to allow forecasts to be constantly updated using high quality local patient-facing data as it emerges.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacob Deasy","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Emma Rocheteau","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Katharina Kohler","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Daniel J.

SARS-CoV-2 has been a global pandemic, but the emergence of asymptomatic patients has caused difficulties in the prevention of the epidemic. Therefore, it is significant to understand the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective and observational study, we collected data from 167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (Chongqing, China) from January to March 2020. The epidemiological characteristics and variable of these patients were collected and analyzed. Findings: 82.04% of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had a travel history in Wuhan or a history of contact with returnees from Wuhan, showing typical characteristics of imported cases, and the proportion of severe Covid-19 patients was 13.2%, of which 59% were imported from Wuhan. For the patients who was returnees from Wuhan, 18.1% was asymptomatic patients. In different infection periods, compared with the proportion after 1\/31\/2020, the proportion of asymptomatic patient among SARS-CoV-2 infected patient was higher(19% VS 1.5%). In different age groups, the proportion of asymptomatic patient was the highest(28.6%) in children group under 14, next in elder group over 70 (27.3%). Compared with mild and common Covid-19 patients, the mean latency of asymptomatic was longer (11.25 days VS 8.86 days), but the hospital length of stay was shorter (14.3 days VS 16.96 days) . Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 prevention needs to focus on the screening of asymptomatic patients in the community with a history of contact with the imported population, especially for children and the elderly population.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Tao","author_inst":"Beibei Tranditional Chinese Medical Hospital, Chongqing, 400000, China"},{"author_name":"Panke

reported among Norwegians that had recently returned from Lombardy, Italy. Travellers from the region rapidly became the most common source of imported infections in the earliest stage of the Norwegian COVID-19 epidemic. The situation was exacerbated by the unfortunate temporal overlap between the Norwegian winter holidays and intense epidemic spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy, resulting in a large number of infected travellers. Here we combined flight data on travels between Norway and Lombardy with patient-level data to determine the fraction of travellers returning to Norway that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Travellers returning to Norway from Lombardy contracted COVID-19 at incidence rates up to 0.02 per person-day in the period spanning February 21st and March 1st, with a clear uptick in transmission in the middle of the period. This shows an example of the infection risk in tourist destinations being several fold higher than elsewhere in the region. In Norway, this is also supported by high rates of infections among tourists returning from Austria in February and March, despite a low number of reported cases in the country at the time. The massive COVID-19 prevalence among travellers suggest that mandatory quarantine of returning travellers or suspension of non-essential international flights is essential if the aim is to control or suppress the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ola Brynildsrud","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vegard

China, and its spread increased rapidly, with cases arising across Mainland China and several other countries. By January 2020, the potential risks imposed by 2019-nCoV in human health and economical activity were promptly highlighted. Considerable efforts have been devoted for understanding the transmission mechanisms aimed to pursue public policies oriented to mitigate the number of infected and deaths. An important question requiring some attention is the role of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature and humidity) in the 2019-nCoV transmission. Correlations between meteorological temperature and relative humidity with the number of daily confirmed cases were explored in this work for the epicenter city of Wuhan, China for the period from 29 January to March 6, 2020. Long-term trend of temperature and relative humidity was obtained with a 14-days adjacent-averaging filter, and lagged correlations of the number of daily confirmed cases were explored. The analysis showed negative correlations between temperatures with the number of daily confirmed cases. Maximum correlations were found for 6-day lagged temperatures, which is likely reflecting the incubation period of the virus. It was postulated that the indoor crowding effect is responsible of the high incidence of 2019-nCoV cases, where low absolute humidity and close human contact facilitate the transport of aerosol droplets.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Alvarez-Ramirez Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa"},{"author_name":"MONICA MERAZ","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa"},{"author_name":"Oswaldo G Cruz","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Claudia T Codeco","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK , and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastory y Piontti","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

By S.E.I.R. simulation, we estimated the most representative basic reproduction number R0 for the three most affected regions from February 22 to March 14, 2020. In doing so, we have been able to evaluate the consistency of the first containment measures until the end of April, as well as identify possible SARS-CoV-2 local behavior mutations and specificities. Next to that, through new estimates of the infection mortality rate, we recalculated a more plausible number of real infected.

(COVID-19) that started in China has already been \"exported\" to more than 140 countries in all the continents, evolving in most of them by local spreading. In this contribution we analyze the trends of the cases reported in all the Chinese provinces, as well as in some countries that, until March 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported. Notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an exponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local case. We identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give interpretations and possible explanations for them. The analysis and conclusions of our study can help countries that, after importing some cases, are not yet in the local spreading phase, or have just started","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albertine Weber","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Flavio Iannelli","author_inst":"URPP Social Networks, University of Zurich, Andreasstrasse 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Goncalves","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Claudia T Codeco","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK , and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastory y Piontti","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

appears surpressed, Europe and the US have become the epicenters, both reporting many more deaths than China. Responding to the pandemic, Sweden has taken a different approach aiming to mitigate, not suppressing community transmission, by using physical distancing without lock-downs. Here we contrast consequences of different responses to COVID-19 within Sweden, the resulting demand for care, intensive care, the death tolls, and the associated direct healthcare related costs. Methods: We use an age stratified health-care demand extended SEIR compartmental model calibrated to the municipality level for all municipalities in Sweden, and a radiation model describing inter-municipality mobility. Results: Our model fit well with the observed deaths in Sweden up to 20th of April, 2020. The intensive care unit (ICU) demand is estimated to reach almost 10,000 patients per day by early May in an unmitigated scenario, far above the pre-pandemic ICU capacity of 526 beds. In contrast, a scenario with moderate physical distancing and shielding of elderly in combination with more effective isolation of infectious individuals would reduce numbers to below 500 per day. This would substantially flatten the curve, extend the epidemic period, but a risk resurgence is expected if measures are relaxed. The different scenarios show quite different death tolls up to the 1th of September, ranging from 5,000 to 41,000 deaths, exluding deaths potentially caused by ICU shortage. Further, analyses of the total all-cause mortality in Stockholm indicate that a confirmed COVID-19 death is associated with a additional 0.40 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.57) all-cause death. Conclusion: The results of this study highlight the impact of different combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions, especially moderate physical distancing and shielding of elderly in combination with more effective isolation of infectious individuals, on reducing deaths and lower healthcare costs. In less effective mitigation scenarios, the demand on ICU beds would rapidly exceed capacity, showing the tight interconnection between the healthcare demand and physical distancing in the society. These findings have relevance for Swedish policy and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and illustrate the importance of maintaining the level of physical distancing for a longer period to suppress or mitigate the impacts from the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joacim Rocklov","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Flavio Iannelli","author_inst":"URPP Social Networks, University of Zurich, Andreasstrasse 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Goncalves","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Claudia T Codeco","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK , and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastory y Piontti","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

unprecedented challenge to healthcare workers. This study analyzes the geo temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID 19. Method Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22 to 59 years. Results Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 to 11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hubei Province (10.4%), and the rest of China (7.0%). The case fatality rate for the 1,688 infected Chinese healthcare workers was significantly lower than that for the 29,798 infected patients aged 20 to 59 years 0.3% (5\/1,688) vs. 0.65% (193\/29,798), respectively. Conclusion The disease severity improved considerably over a short period of time in China. The more severe conditions in Wuhan compared to the rest of the country may be attributable to the draconian lockdown. The clinical outcomes of infected Chinese healthcare workers may represent a more accurate estimation of the severity of COVID 19 for those who have access to quality healthcare.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wayne Gao","author_inst":"Taipei Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mattia Sanna","author_inst":"Taipei Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chi Pang Wen","author_inst":"National Health Research Institute; China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Claudia T Codeco","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK , and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastory y Piontti","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there remains a need for spatially granular analyses of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. Methods: We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and unmet child care needs across the United States. We develop individual simulations using county-level demographic and occupational data, and model school closure effectiveness with age-structured compartmental models. We perform multivariate quasi-Poisson ecological regressions to find associations between unmet child care needs and COVID-19 vulnerability factors. Results: At the national level, we estimate the projected rate of unmet child care needs for healthcare worker households to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 3.2% to 7.2% reduction in fewer ICU beds at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected unmet child care needs and school closure effects, ranging from 1.9% to 18.3% of healthcare worker households and 5.7% to 8.8% reduction in fewer ICU beds at peak demand. We find significant positive associations between estimated levels of unmet child care needs and diabetes prevalence, county rurality, and race (p < 0.05). We estimate costs of absenteeism and child care and observe from our models that an estimated 71.1% to 98.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures. Conclusions: School closures are projected to reduce peak ICU bed demand, but could disrupt healthcare systems through absenteeism, especially in counties that are already particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Child care subsidies could help circumvent the ostensible tradeoff between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth T Chin","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Q Huynh","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nathan C Lo","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Trevor Hastie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Basu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK , and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastory y Piontti","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

This study aims to understand the global pandemic geospatial patterns and trends and identify new epicenters requiring urgent attention. Methods: Data on COVID-19 between 31st Dec. 2019 and 14th Mar. 2020 was included. The epidemic trend was analyzed using joinpoint regressions; the growth of affected countries was by descriptive analysis; and the global distribution and transmission trend by spatial analysis. Findings: The number of new cases in the regions outside of China slowly increased before 24th Feb. and rapidly accelerated after 24th Feb. Compared to China, other affected countries experienced a longer duration of a slow increase at the early stage and rapid growth at the latter stages. The first apparent increase in the number of affected countries occurred from 23rd Jan to 1st Feb, and the second apparent increase started from 25th Feb. The fist COVID-19 cases reported by countries from 28th Feb. were mainly imported from Europe. The geographic distribution changed from single-center (13th Jan.-20th Feb.) to multi-centers pattern (20th Feb.-14th Mar.). More countries were affected with COVID-19 and developed local transmission. Interpretation: The joinpoint regression and geospatial analysis indicated a multi-center pandemic of COVID-19. Strategies to prevent the new multiple centers as well as prevent ongoing transmission are needed.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huipeng Liao","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Project-China"},{"author_name":"Gifty Marley","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Nanjing Medical University and University of North Carolina Project-China"},{"author_name":"Yafei Si","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Project-China"},{"author_name":"Zaisheng Wang","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Project-China"},{"author_name":"Yewei Xie","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Project-China"},{"author_name":"Cheng Wang","author_inst":"Dermatology Hospital and the Institute of Global Health and STI Research of Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Weiming Tang","author_inst":"Dermatology Hospital, Southern Medical University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Project-China"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

respiratory infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARSCoV-2). This virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as the cellular entry receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID19, we determined whether ACE2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking. Methods: Using RNAseq, we determined gene expression levels in bronchial epithelia obtained from cytologic brushings of 6th to 8th generation airways in individuals with and without COPD. We externally validated these results from two additional independent cohorts, which used microarray technologies to measure gene expression levels from 6th to 12th generation airways. Results: In the discovery cohort (n=42 participants), we found that ACE2 expression levels were increased by 48% in the airways of COPD compared with non-COPD subjects (COPD=2.52 (0.66) log2 counts per million reads (CPM) versus non-COPD= 1.70 (0.51) CPM , p=.000762). There was a significant inverse relationship between ACE2 gene expression and FEV1% of predicted (r=negative 0.24; p=0.035). Current smoking also significantly increased ACE2 expression levels compared with never smokers (never current smokers=2.77 (90.91) CPM versus smokers=1.78 (0.39) CPM, p=0.024). These findings were replicated in the two external cohorts. Conclusions: ACE2 expression in lower airways is increased in patients with COPD and with current smoking. These data suggest that these two subgroups are at increased risk of serious COVID19 infection and highlight the importance of smoking cessation in reducing the risk.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janice M Leung","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Chen Xi Yang","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Anthony Tam","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Tawimas Shaipanich","author_inst":"Department of Medicine (Division of Respirology), University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Tillie L Hackett","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia, Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Gurpreet K Singhera","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Delbert R Dorscheid","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Don D Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

2019, an unknown-origin pneumonia outbreak detected in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China. We aimed to build a model to qualitatively and quantitatively assess publications of research of COVID-19 from 2019 to 2020. Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from the Web of Science (WOS), PubMed, and Scopus Core Collection on March 02, 2020, and updated on March 10. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of publication outputs, journals, authors, institutions, countries, cited references, keywords, and terms according to bibliometric methods using VOS viewer c software packages. Results: Initially, we identified 227 papers, of which after an exclusion process, 92 studies were selected for statistical analyses. China accounted for the highest proportion of published research (44 papers, 40.48%), followed by the United States (21 papers, 19.32%), and Canada (7 papers, 6.44%). Adjusted by gross domestic product (GDP), ranked first, with 0.003 articles per billion GDP. In total, the top 10 journals published 47 articles, which accounted for 51.08% of all publications in this Feld. A total of 6 studies (05.52%) were supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China. Chinese Academy of Sciences ranked second 2, 2.76%). Conclusion: Bibliometric and visualized mapping may quantitatively monitor research performance in science and present predictions. The subject of this study was the fast growing publication on COVID-19. Most studies are published in journals with very high impact factors (IFs) and other journals are more interested in this type of research.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fateme Rafiei Nasab","author_inst":"Msc  in  Medical  informatics;  Department  of  Scientometrics,  Deputy  of  Research  and Technology  Affaires;  Ahvaz  Jundishapur  University  of  Medical  S"},{"author_name":"Fakher rahim","author_inst":"Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Abigail Green-Saxena","author_inst":"Dascena Inc., Oakland, CA, United States"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Summers","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jana Hoffman","author_inst":"Dascena Inc., Oakland, CA, United States"},{"author_name":"Jacob Calvert","author_inst":"Dascena Inc., Oakland, CA, United States"},{"author_name":"Ritankar Das","author_inst":"Dascena Inc., Oakland, CA, United States"},{"author_name":"Don D Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

Methods: 37 cases diagnosed adult COVID-19 cases of general characteristics, history of epidemiology, chronic underlying diseases,clinical symptoms and complications, chest CT, biochemical monitoring, severity assessment, treatment and outcome were retrospectively analyzed, and according to the duration from onset to release from quarantine were divided into 20-day group and > 20-day group, compare the similarities and differences between the two groups. Results: Among the 37 patients, 5 were mild, 30 were moderate, 1 was severe and 1 was critical. All the patients were released from quarantine without death. The average duration from onset to release from quarantine was 20.2{+\/-}6.6 days, The average length of stay from onset to hospitalization was 4.1{+\/-}3.7 days, and hospitalization duration average 16.1{+\/-} 6.2 days. The average age was 44.3{+\/-}1.67 years. 78.4% of cases were caused by exposure to a confirmed patient or the workplace of a confirmed patient. The main symptoms were cough (67.6%), fever( 62.2%), shortness of breath (32.4%), fatigue (24.3%), sore throat (21.6%,) vomiting or diarrhea (21.6%). The white blood cell count was decreased in 27.0% of the patients, and the lymphocyte count was decreased in 62.2% of the patients, of which 43.5% patients were <0.6 x 109\/L. On admission, 86.5% of patients with chest CT showed pneumonia, including some asymptomatic patients. 68.8% of patients showed bilateral infiltration.

The aim of this research is to provide a high-resolution global model of the pandemic that overcomes the problem of biased country-level data on the number of infected cases. To achieve this we propose a novel SIR-type metapopulation transmission model and a set of analytically derived model parameters. We used them to perform a simulation of the disease spread with help of the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEAM) framework embedding actual population densities, commute patterns and long-range travel networks. The simulation starts on Nov 17th, 2019 with just a single pre-symptomatic, yet infectious, case in Wuhan, China, and results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 154 days in multiple countries across five continents. In addition, the model outcome shows high compliance with the results of a random screening test conducted on pregnant women in the New York area. Method: We have built a modified SIR metapopulation transmission model and parameterized it analytically either by setting the values of the parameters based on the literature, or by assuming their plausible values. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in twenty selected countries which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken Non-Drug Interventions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions are in agreement with the empirical data. Results: The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, 4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. Discussion: Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marlena M Siwiak","author_inst":"Data 3.0"},{"author_name":"Pawel Szczesny","author_inst":"Data 3.0"},{"author_name":"Marian P

by Iranian governments, the first cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections confirmed in Qom, Iran on February 19, 2020 (30 Bahman 1398). The number of identified cases afterward increased rapidly and the novel coronavirus spread to all provinces of the country. This study aimed to fit an epidemic model to the reported cases data to estimate the basic reproduction number (R_0) of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: We used data from February 21, 2020, to April 21, 2020, on the number of cases reported by Iranian governments and we employed the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) epidemic spreading model to fit the transmission model to the reported cases data by tuning the parameters in order to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Iran. Results: The value of reproduction number was estimated 4.86 in the first week and 4.5 in the second week. it decreased from 4.29 to 2.37 in the next four weeks. At the seventh week of the outbreak the reproduction number was reduced below 1. Conclusions: The results indicate that the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was significantly larger than one in the early stages of the outbreak. However, implementing social distancing and preventing travelling on Nowruz (Persian New Year) effectively reduced the reproduction number. Although the results indicate that reproduction number is below one, it is necessary to continue social distancing and control travelling to prevent causing a second wave of outbreak.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ebrahim Sahafizadeh","author_inst":"Payame Noor University"},{"author_name":"Samaneh Sartoli","author_inst":"Payame Noor

100,000 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been confirmed globally based on positive viral nucleic acids with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the association between clinical, laboratory and CT characteristics and RT-PCR results is still unclear. We sought to examine this association in detail, especially in recovered patients. Methods: We analysed data from 52 confirmed patients who had been discharged with COVID-19. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were dynamically recorded and compared with the admission and follow-up RT-PCR results. Results: In this cohort, 52 admitted COVID-19 patients who had confirmed positive RT-PCR results were discharged after 2 rounds of consecutively negative RT-PCR results. Compared with admission levels, CRP levels (median 4.93 mg\/L [IQR: 1.78-10.20]) decreased significantly (p<0.001). and lymphocyte counts (median 1.50x109\/L [IQR: 1.11-1.88]) increased obviously after obtaining negative RT-PCR results (p<0.001). Additionally, substantially improved inflammatory exudation was observed on chest CT except for 2 progressed patients. At the two-week follow-up after discharge, 7 patients had re-positive RT-PCR results, including the abovementioned 2 progressed patients. Among the 7 patients, new GGO was demonstrated in 2 patients. There were no significant differences in CPR levels or lymphocyte counts when comparing the negative and re-positive PCT results (all p >0.05). Conclusion: Heterogeneity between CT features and RT-PCR results was found in COVID-19, especially in some recovered patients with negative RT-PCR results. Our study highlights that both RT-PCR and chest CT should be considered as the key determinants for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hang Fu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry

January 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has spread rapidly and developing the pandemic model around the world. Data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients in an imported cases as model in island outside Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study included all 168 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Hainan province from 22 January 2020 to 13 March 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data. Results: Of 168 patients, 160 have been discharged, 6 have died and 2 remain hospitalized. The median age was 51.0 years and 51.8% were females. 129 (76.8%) patients were imported cases, and 118 (70.2%), 51 (30.4%) and 52 (31%) of patients lived in Wuhan or traveled to Wuhan, had contact with Covid-19 patients, or had contact with Wuhan residents, respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (65.5%), dry cough (48.8%) and expectoration (32.1%). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (60.2%). The elderly people with diabetes, hypertension and CVD are more likely to develop severe cases. Follow-up of 160 discharged patients found that 20 patients (12.5%) had a positive RT-PCR test results of pharyngeal swabs or anal swabs or fecal. Conclusions: In light of the rapid spread of Covid-19 around the world, early diagnosis and quarantine is important to curb the spread of Covid-19 and intensive treatments in early stage is to prevent patients away from critical condition.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shijiao Yan","author_inst":"Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xingyue Song","author_inst":"Tongji

and effective medical countermeasures (e.g., antivirals\/antibodies) to address the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org\/medrxiv.org; additional searches for ongoing trials and unpublished studies were conducted in clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON). Title\/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers. Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, seven retrospective medical record\/database studies, and 34 case reports or series. These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The most common treatment was ribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination of lopinavir\/ritonavir (n=7). Additional therapies included broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30), steroids (n=39) or various interferons (n=12). No eligible studies examining monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 were identified. One trial found that ribavirin prophylactic treatment statistically significantly reduced risk of MERS infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. Of the 21 studies reporting rates of ICU admission in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, none reported statistically significant results in favour of or against antiviral therapies. Of the 40 studies reporting mortality rates in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, one cohort study (MERS) and one retrospective study (SARS) found a statistically significant increase in the mortality rate for patients treated with ribavirin. Eighteen studies reported potential drug-related adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin. Conclusion: The current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapies for coronavirus is inconclusive and suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials or observational studies, preventing any treatment recommendations from being made. However, it is clear that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards ribavirin (41\/54 studies), which has not shown conclusive evidence of effectiveness and may cause harmful adverse events so future investigations may consider focusing on other candidates for antiviral therapy.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patricia Rios","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Research Institute, Knowledge Translation Program, St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amruta Radhakrishnan","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Research Institute, Knowledge Translation Program, St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Jesmin Antony","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Research Institute, Knowledge Translation Program, St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sonia M.
