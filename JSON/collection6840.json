Fomsgaard et al 2020 recently presented results using heat-processing of respiratory samples prior to RT-qPCR as an economical method enabling an extremely fast streamlining of the processes at virtually no cost. Here, we present our results using this method and highlight some major pitfalls that diagnostics laboratories should be aware of before proceeding with this technique. We first investigated various treatments using different temperatures, incubation times and sample volumes based on the above study to optimise the heat-treatment conditions. Although the initial data confirmed the published results, further investigations revealed unexpected inhibitory properties of some commonly used virus transport media (VTMs) on some commercially available RT-qPCR mixes, emphasising the critical importance of a thorough validation process to determine the most adapted reagents to be used depending on the sample types to be tested. In conclusion, although the method works, with very consistent Ct values and an excellent sensitivity when compared to a conventional RNA extraction method, it is critical to include an internal control to check each sample for potential inhibition.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ronan MM Calvez","author_inst":"Micropathology Ltd"},{"author_name":"Andrew Taylor","author_inst":"Micropatholgy Ltd"},{"author_name":"Leonides Calvo-Bado","author_inst":"Micropathology Ltd"},{"author_name":"Colin G Fink","author_inst":"Micropathology Ltd"},{"author_name":"Artur Paiva Coutinho","author_inst":"UFPE"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083113","rel_title":"The Chronic Kidney Disease and Acute Kidney Injury Involvement in COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083113","rel_abs":"Aim: The aim of this study was to uncover whether kidney diseases were involved in COVID-19 pandemic from a systematic review. Methods: The studies reported the kidney outcomes in different severity of COVID-19 were included in this study. Standardized mean differences or odds ratios were calculated by employing Review Manager meta-analysis software. Results: Thirty-six trials were included in this systematic review with a total of 6395 COVID-19 patients. The overall effects indicated that the comorbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR = 3.28), complication of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR = 11.02), serum creatinine (SMD = 0.68), abnormal serum creatinine (OR = 4.86), blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.95), abnormal blood urea nitrogen (OR = 6.53), received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (OR = 23.63) was significantly increased in severe group than that in nonsevere group. Additionally, the complication of AKI (OR = 13.92) and blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.18) were remarkably elevated in critical group than that in severe group. Conclusion: CKD and AKI are susceptible to occur in patients with severe COVID-19. CRRT is applied frequently in severe COVID-19 patients than that in nonsevere COVID-19 patients. The risk of AKI is higher in critical group than that in severe group.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ya-Fei Liu","author_inst":"The first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zhe Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Li Pan","author_inst":"Hubei University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guo-Lan Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zhang-Suo Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Sheng-Hao Tu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20082735","rel_title":"Clinical features and outcomes of inpatients with neurological disease and COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20082735","rel_abs":"Objective: To report the clinical and laboratory characteristics, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients admitted for neurological diseases with and without COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective, single center cohort study, we included all adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to a Neuro-COVID Unit from February 21, 2020, who had been discharged or died by April 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (FDR-corrected) to those of neurological patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period. Results: 173 patients were included in this study, of whom 56 were positive for COVID-19 while 117 were negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older, had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders, and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (all p<0.05). In-hospital mortality rates and incident delirium were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (all p<0.005). COVID-19 and non-COVID patients with stroke had similar baseline characteristics but patients with COVID-19 had higher modified Rankin scale scores at discharge, with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (all p<0.001). In patients with COVID-19, multivariable regressions showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with higher qSOFA scores (odds ratio 4.47, 95% CI 1.21-16.5; p=0.025), lower platelet count (0.98, 0.97-0.99; p=0.005) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (1.01, 1.00-1.03; p=0.009) on admission. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients admitted with neurological disease, including stroke, have a significantly higher in-hospital mortality, incident delirium and higher disability than patients without COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Benussi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Pilotto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Enrico Premi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Libri","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marcello Giunta","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agosti","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Antonella Alberici","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Enrico Baldelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matteo Benini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Invernizzi","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ugo Leggio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Masciocchi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Raffaella Spezi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20085860","rel_title":"Coding variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not major drivers of COVID-19 severity in UK Biobank subjects.","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20085860","rel_abs":"It is plausible that variants in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes might contribute to variation in COVID-19 severity and that these could explain why some people become very unwell whereas most do not.

A weighted burden analysis was carried out using SCOREASSOC to determine whether there were differences between these cases and the other sequenced subjects in the overall burden of rare, damaging variants in ACE2 or TMPRSS2. There were no statistically significant differences in weighted burden scores between cases and controls for either gene. There were no individual DNA sequence variants with a markedly different frequency between cases and controls. Whether there are small effects on severity, or whether there might be rare variants with major effect sizes, would require studies in much larger samples.

In response, many health systems have chosen to restrict access to surgery and reallocate resources; the impact on the provision of surgical services has been profound, with huge numbers of patient now awaiting surgery at the risk of avoidable harm. The challenge now is how do hospitals transition from the current pandemic mode of operation back to business as usual, and ensure that all patients receive equitable, timely and high-quality surgical care during all phases of the public health crisis. Aims and Methods This case study takes carotid endarterectomy as a time-sensitive surgical procedure and simulates 400 compartmental demand modelling scenarios for managing surgical capacity in the UK for two years following the pandemic. Results A total of 7,69 patients will require carotid endarterectomy. In the worst-case scenario, if no additional capacity is provided on resumption of normal service, the waiting list may never be cleared, and no patient will receive surgery within the 2-week target; potentially leading to >1000 avoidable strokes. If surgical capacity is doubled after 1-month of resuming normal service, it will still take more than 6-months to clear the backlog, and 30.8% of patients will not undergo surgery within 2-weeks, with an average wait of 20.3 days for the proceeding 2 years. Conclusions This case study for carotid endarterectomy has shown that every healthcare system is going to have to make difficult decisions for balancing human and capital resources against the needs of patients. It has demonstrated that the timing and size of this effort will critically influence the ability of these systems to return to their baseline and continue to provide the highest quality care for all. The failure to sustainably increase surgical capacity early in the post-COVID-19 period will have significant long-term negative impacts on patients and is likely to result in avoidable harm.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guy Martin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Carter","author_inst":"London School of Economics & Political Science"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ara Darzi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"PanSurg Collaborative","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Invernizzi","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ugo Leggio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Masciocchi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Raffaella Spezi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20084475","rel_title":"Reduced COVID-19-Related Critical Illness and Death, and High Risk of Epidemic Resurgence, After Physical Distancing in Ontario, Canada","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20084475","rel_abs":"We explored the impact of physical distancing measures on COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada using a previously described age- and health-status stratified transmission model. The model was fit to confirmed cases occupying intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 cases for the time period 19 March to 26 April 2020. We projected that mortality would have been 4.6-fold what was observed had physical distancing measures not been implemented in the province. Relaxation of physical distancing measures without compensatory increases in case detection, isolation, and\/or contact tracing was projected to result in resurgence of disease activity. Return to normal or near-normal levels of contact would rapidly result in cases exceeding ICU capacity. Maintaining physical distancing for a longer period of time, allowing for the initial wave of infections to subside, delayed this resurgence, but the level of contacts post-restrictive distancing was the major factor determining how quickly ICU capacity was expected to be overwhelmed. Using a model, we demonstrate the marked impact strong public health measures had in reducing ICU admissions and mortality in Ontario. We also show that this hard-earned success is tenuous: relaxation of physical distancing measures in the near-term is projected to result in a rapid resurgence of disease activity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashleigh Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy L Greer","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Steven De Keninck","author_inst":"Matrix Factory bvba"},{"author_name":"David N Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ara Darzi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"PanSurg Collaborative","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Invernizzi","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ugo Leggio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Masciocchi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Raffaella Spezi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20084863","rel_title":"Inflammatory markers in Covid-19 Patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20084863","rel_abs":"Introduction Diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on clinical manifestation, history of exposure, positive findings on chest CT and laboratory tests.

Scientific studies to date have focused primarily on describing the clinical course of patients, identifying treatment options and developing vaccines. In Germany, as in many other regions, current tests for SARS-CoV2 are not being conducted on a representative basis and in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, knowledge about the immune status of the population is lacking. Yet these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and to thus appropriately design and evaluate interventions. For this purpose, we recently started a prospective population-based cohort in Munich, Germany, with the aim to better understand the state and dynamics of the pandemic. Methods: In 100, randomly selected constituencies out of 755, 3,000 Munich households are identified via random route and offered enrollment into the study. All household members are asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and subjects [&ge;]14 years of age are asked to provide a venous blood sample of [&le;]3 ml for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/IgA status. The residual plasma and the blood pellet are preserved for later genetic and molecular biological investigations. For twelve months, each household member is asked to keep a diary of daily symptoms, whereabouts and contacts via WebApp. If symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 are reported, family members, including children <14 years, are offered a pharyngeal swab taken at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. In case of severe symptoms, participants will be transferred to a Munich hospital. For one year, the study teams re-visits the households for blood sampling every six weeks. Discussion: With the planned study we will establish a reliable epidemiological tool to improve the understanding of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to better assess the effectiveness of public health measures as well as their socio-economic effects. This will support policy makers in managing the epidemic based on scientific evidence.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katja Radon","author_inst":"Center for International Health and Institute for Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich"},{"author_name":"Elmar Saathoff","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Mun"},{"author_name":"Michael Pritsch","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jessica Michelle Guggenbuehl Noller","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Inge Kroidl","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Mun"},{"author_name":"Laura Olbrich","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Verena Thiel","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Diefenbach","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Friedrich Riess","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Felix Forster","author_inst":"Institute and Outpatient Clinic for Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) University Hospital Munich"},{"author_name":"Fabian J Theis","author_inst":"Helmholtz Center Munich and Departments of Mathematics and Life Sciences, Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Andreas Wieser","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany and Max von Pettenkofer Institute, Faculty of Medicine, LMU of Mu"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelscher","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich;

Methods A total of 56 COVID-19 patients without symptoms at admission and 19 age-matched symptomatic patients were enrolled. RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was tested using transcriptase quantitative PCR, and the total antibodies (Ab), IgG, IgA and IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 were tested using Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immuno Assay. Results Among 56 patients without symptoms at admission, 33 cases displayed symptoms and 23 remained asymptomatic throughout the follow-up period. 43.8% of the asymptomatic carriers were children and none of the asymptomatic cases had recognizable changes in C-reactive protein or interleukin-6, except one 64-year-old patient. The initial threshold cycle value of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers was similar to that in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients, but the communicable period of asymptomatic carriers (9.63 days) was shorter than pre-symptomatic patients (13.6 days). There was no obvious differences of the seropositive conversion rate of total Ab, IgG, and IgA among the three groups, though the rates of IgM varied largely. The average peak IgG and IgM COI of asymptomatic cases was 3.5 and 0.8, respectively, which is also lower than those in symptomatic patients with peaked IgG and IgM COI of 4.5 and 2.4 (p <0.05). Conclusion Young COVID-19 patients seem to be asymptomatic cases with early clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and low levels of IgM generation but high total Ab, IgG and IgA. Our findings provide empirical information for viral clearance and antibody kinetics of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology,Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tongyang Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanrong Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haocheng Ye","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lanlan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shen Qian","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andreas Wieser","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany and Max von Pettenkofer Institute, Faculty of Medicine, LMU of Mu"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelscher","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich; Center for International Health, LMU of Munich and German Center for Infe"},{"author_name":"KoCo19 collaboration group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Invernizzi","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ugo Leggio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Masciocchi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Raffaella Spezi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083691","rel_title":"Ultra-Sensitive High-Resolution Profiling of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies for Detecting Early Seroconversion in COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083691","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to infect millions of people worldwide.

This multiplexed assay format allows us to quantitate IgG, IgM and IgA immunoglobulins against four SARS-CoV-2 targets, thereby interrogating 12 antibody isotype-viral protein interactions to give a high resolution profile of the immune response. Using a cohort of samples collected prior to the outbreak as well as samples collected during the pandemic, we demonstrate a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100% during the first week of infection, and 100% sensitivity and specificity thereafter.

SARS-CoV-2 is novel to most parts of the world including USA and the effect on normally prevalent viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March, 2020. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at BSWH, Temple TX. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time RT-PCR assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. Results: More than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1,659 ED\/inpatients were tested positive. Higher rate of infection (6.9%) were noted in the patients belonging to age group 25-34 years and least number of positive cases were noted in <25 years old (2%) group. The TX State county specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a sudden decrease in the occurrence of other infections due to seasonal viruses, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness, about SARS-CoV-2, among general public. Authors would also like to share a small study on SARS-CoV-2 serological assay for the detection of IgG antibodies. Conclusions: This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manohar B Mutnal","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Alejandro C Arroliga","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Walker","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Amin A Mohammad","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Matthew M Brigmon","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Ryan M Beaver","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"John K Midturi","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Arundhati Rao","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Blake M.

Serology testing is important for diagnosis of infection, determining infection attack rates and immunity in the population. It also informs vaccine development. Although several serology tests are in use, improving their specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis on the one hand and for detecting past infection for population-based studies, are priorities. Methods: We evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles to 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens by cloning and expressing 15 open reading frames (ORFs) in mammalian cells and screened antibody responses to them in COVID-19 patients using the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS). Results: The LIPS technique allowed us to detect antibody responses in COVID-19 patients to 11 of the 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested, identifying novel immunogenic targets. This technique shows that antigens ORF3b and ORF8 allow detection of antibody early in infection in a specific manner and reveals the immuno-dominance of the N antigen in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Our report provides an unbiased characterization of antibody responses to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The combination of 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody LIPS assays, i.e. N, ORF3b, and ORF8, is sufficient to identify all COVID-19 patients of our cohort even at early time-points of illness, whilst Spike alone fails to do so. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of investigating new immunogens NSP1, ORF3b, ORF7a and ORF8 which may mediate immune functions other than neutralization which may be beneficial or harmful to the patient.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asmaa Hachim","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Niloufar Kavian","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Carolyn A Cohen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Alex WH Chin","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Daniel KW Chu","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Owen TY Tsang","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital, Hospital Authority of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yiu Cheong Yeung","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital, Hospital Authority of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ranawaka APM Perera","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Leo LM Poon","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Malik JS Peiris","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sophie A Valkenburg","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH"},{"author_name":"Richelle C.

The nasal and lower conducting airways have similar cell composition and nasal transcriptomes identify disease state and sub-classes in lung cancer, COPD, and asthma. We conducted an observational, prospective trial to determine whether this technique could identify PARDS endotypes in 26 control and 25 PARDS subjects <18 admitted to the pediatric ICU. RNA from inferior turbinate brushing was collected on days 1, 3, 7, and 14. Standard RNA-processing yielded 29% usable specimens by mRNA-Seq, and a low-input protocol increased yield to 95% usable specimens. 64 low-input specimens from 10 control and 15 PARDS subjects were used for model development. Control and some PARDS subjects clustered together in Group A while some day 1, 3, and 7 specimens clustered into Groups B and C with specimens from these subjects moving to Group A with PARDS resolution. In multivariate analysis, the only clinical variables associated with specimen Group B or C assignment was severity of lung injury or viral PARDS trigger. Compared to Group A, Group B had upregulation of innate immune processes and Group C had upregulation of ciliary and microtuble processes. Analysis of the 15 standard processing specimens identified the same grouping. Mortality trended higher in group B (25%) and C subjects (28.6%) compared to A (5%, p=0.1). Comparison of groups with 16 PARDS-associated serum biomarkers identified correlation of Endotype B with Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, but not other inflammatory cytokines and Endotype C with Surfactant Protein D. We identified three nasal transcriptomic PARDS endotypes. A is similar to control. B is marked by an innate immune signature only weakly reflected in the serum. C may be associated with loss of epithelial barrier integrity. Nasal transcriptomics may be useful for prognostic and predictive enrichment in future PARDS trials.

An appropriate immune response mediates protection, whereas an overwhelming immune response has been associated with immune-mediated pathogenesis in viral infections. The current study explored the general and SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular and humoral immune status in patients with different COVID-19 severities. Methods: In this prospective study, we included 53 patients with moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 manifestations comparing their quantitative, phenotypic, and functional characteristics of circulating immune cells, SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T-cells, and humoral immunity. Results: Significantly diminished frequencies of CD8+T-cells, CD4+ and CD8+T-cell subsets with activated differentiated memory\/effector phenotype and migratory capacity were found in circulation in patients with severe and\/or critical COVID-19 as compared to patients with moderate disease. Importantly, the improvement of the clinical courses from severe to moderate was accompanied by an improvement in the T-cell subset alterations. Furthermore, we surprisingly observed a detectable SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cell response in all three groups after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein overlapping peptide pool already at the first visit. Of note, patients with a critical COVID-19 demonstrated a stronger response of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells producing Th1 associated inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, clear correlation between antibody titers and SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ frequencies underscore the role of specific immunity in disease progression. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that depletion of activated memory phenotype circulating T-cells and a strong SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunity are associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This counter-intuitive finding may have important implications for diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic COVID-19 management.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Moritz

Healthcare is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic through the fast adoption of digital solutions and advanced technology tools. The aim of this study is to describe which digital solutions have been reported in the scientific literature and to investigate their potential impact in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. We conducted a literature review searching PubMed and MedrXiv with terms considered adequate to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to COVID-19. We developed an impact score to evaluate the potential impact on COVID-19 pandemic of all the digital solutions addressed in the selected papers. Results. The search identified 269 articles, of which 145 full-text articles were assessed and 124 included in the review after screening and impact evaluation. Of selected articles, most of them addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance and prevention. We report that digital solutions and innovative technologies have mainly been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In particular, within the reviewed articles we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial-intelligence-powered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. Digital technologies are useful also for prevention and surveillance measures, for example through contact-tracing apps or monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. Discussion. It is worth taking advantage of the push given by the crisis, and mandatory to keep track of the digital solutions proposed today to implement tomorrow's best practices and models of care, and to be ready for any new moments of emergency.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davide Golinelli","author_inst":"DIBINEM, University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Erik

The extent of nosocomial transmission that contributed to the HCW infections was unknown. Methods: We combined epidemiological data, collected by means of structured interviews of HCWs, with whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples from HCWs and patients in three of nine hospitals that participated in the HCW screening, to perform an in-depth analysis of sources and modes of transmission of SARS -CoV-2 in HCWs and patients. Results: A total of 1,796 out of 12,022 HCWs (15%) of the three participating hospitals were screened, based on clinical symptoms, of whom 96 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We obtained complete genome sequences of 50 HCWs and 18 patients. Most sequences grouped in 3 clusters, with 2 clusters displaying local circulation within the region. The observed patterns are most consistent with multiple introductions into the hospitals through community acquired infections, and local amplification in the community. Conclusions: Although direct transmission in the hospitals cannot be ruled out, the data does not support widespread nosocomial transmission as source of infection in patients or healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Suzan Pas","author_inst":"Microvida Laboratory for Microbiology, Bravis Hospital, Roosendaal\/ Microvida Laboratory for Microbiology, Amphia Hospital, Breda"},{"author_name":"David F.

Japan is known to have relatively less number of infections as well as deaths among developed nations. However, accurate prevalence of COVID-19 in Japan remains unknown. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using 1,000 samples from patients at outpatient settings who visited the clinic from March 31 to April 7, 2020, stratified by decade of age and sex. Results There were 33 positive IgG among 1,000 serum samples (3.3%, 95%CI: 2.3-4.6%). By applying this figure to the census of Kobe City (poplation: 1,518,870), it is estimated that the number of people with positive IgG be 50,123 (95%CI: 34,934-69,868). Age and sex adjusted prevalence of positivity was 2.7% (95%CI 1.8-3.9%), and the estimated number of people with positive IgG was 40,999 (95%CI: 27,333-59,221). These numbers were 396 to 858 fold more than confirmed cases with PCR testing in Kobe City. Conclusions Our cross-sectional serological study suggests that the number of people with seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kobe, Japan is far more than the confirmed cases by PCR testing.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asako Doi","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Iwata","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hirokazu Kuroda","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Toshikazu Hasuike","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Seiko Nasu","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aya Kanda","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tomomi Nagao","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hiroaki Nishioka","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Keisuke Tomii","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Morimoto","author_inst":"Hyogo Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yasuki Kihara","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ronald J Overmars","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Stefan van Nieuwkoop","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Wouter van den Bijllaardt","author_inst":"Microvida Laboratory for Microbiology, Amphia Hospital, Breda"},{"author_name":"Robbert G.

This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and its association with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single-center tertiary care institution in northern California and included consecutive inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The prevalence of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables were examined and included the need for transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and 30-day all-cause mortality. Results: Paired nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were included from 85 patients. The overall median age was 55 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma (63 vs 50 years; p=0.001). Comorbidities were frequent including obesity (37.7%), hypertension (30.6%) and diabetes mellitus (22.4%). RNAemia was detected in a total of 28\/85 (32.9%) individual patients, including 22\/28 (78.6%) who required hospital admission. RNAemia was detected more frequently in individuals who developed severe disease including the need for ICU transfer (32.1% vs 14.0%; p=0.05), mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 3.5%; p=0.01) and 30-day all-cause mortality (14.3% vs 0%; p=0.01). No association was detected between RNAemia and estimated levels of viral RNA in the nasopharynx. An additional 121 plasma samples from 28 individuals with RNAemia were assessed longitudinally, and RNA was detected for a maximum duration of 10 days. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, and an association between RNAemia and clinical severity suggesting the potential utility of plasma viral testing as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catherine A.

That said, SARS-CoV-2 infects children across all age groups, and despite the high proportion of mild or asymptomatic infections, it would be naive not to consider them as transmitters. To address this point we used cell culture to systematically assess the presence of cultivable SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract in a cohort of our institution first 23 symptomatic neonates, children and teenagers with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR (See Appendix). Median age was 12.0 years (interquartile range [IQR 3.8-14.5], range 7 days-15.9 yrs). Most patients had an upper respiratory tract infection (n=13), followed by fever without source and pneumonia (each, n=2). Samples were collected at a median of 2 days (IQR 1-3) after symptom onset. Median viral load (VL) at time of diagnosis was 3.0x106 copies\/ml (mean 4,4x108, IQR 6.9x103-4.4x108) from a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). SARS-CoV-2 virus isolation was successful in 12\/23 (52%) children after inoculating VeroE6 cells with a NPS specimen. SARS-CoV-2 isolation was determined by the presence of a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) and increased viral RNA in the supernatant. SARS-CoV-2 replication in all positive isolates (12\/12) was confirmed by a second passage using new VeroE6 cells. Virus isolation was successful from NPS from all age groups, with a median initial VL of 1.7x108 copies\/ml (mean 7.9x108, IQR 4.7x106-1.0x109) (Figure 1). The youngest patient that SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from was a 7-day old neonate. No correlation between disease presentation and success of virus isolation was observed. Our data show that initial VLs at diagnosis in symptomatic children is comparable to those in adults, and that symptomatic children of all ages shed infectious virus in early acute illness. Infectious virus isolation success was largely comparable to that of adults, although two specimens yielded an isolate at a lower VL (1.2x104 and 1.4x105 copies\/ml) than what was observed in adults. SARS-CoV-2 shedding patterns of culture competent virus in symptomatic children resemble those observed in adults. Therefore, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children is plausible. Considering the relatively low frequency of infected children at this time, biological or other unknown factors could reduce transmission in this population. Both large serological investigations and systematic surveillance of acute respiratory diseases are needed to understand the role of children in this new pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arnaud G L'Huillier","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Giulia Torriani","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Fiona Pigny","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Isabelle Eckerle","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Fiona Yamamoto","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kanagavel Murugesan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jason Kurzer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A.

There are lots of methods for modelling. But we want to determine the best mathematical model and the best time series method among other models. Methods: The data was obtained between January 22 and April 21, 2020 from China records. The number of total cases and the number of total deaths were used for the calculations. For modelling Weibull, Negative Exponential, Von Bertalanffy, Janoscheck, Lundqvist-Korf and Sloboda models were used and AR, MA, ARMA, Holt, Brown and Damped models were used for time series. The determination coefficient (R2), Pseudo R2 and mean square error were used for nonlinear modelling as criteria for determining the model that best describes the number of cases, the number of total deaths and BIC (Bayesian Information Criteria) was used for time series. Results: According to our results, the Sloboda model among the growth curves and ARIMA (0,2,1) model among the times series models were most suitable models for modelling of the number of total cases. In addition Lundqvist-Korf model among the growth curves and Holt linear trend exponential smoothing model among the times series models were most suitable model for modelling of the number of total deaths. Our time series models forecast that the number of total cases will 83311 on 5 May and the number of total deaths will be 5273. Conclusions: Because results of the modelling has providing information on measures to be taken and giving prior information for subsequent similar situations, it is of great importance modeling outbreak indicators for each country separately.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Senol Celik","author_inst":"Department of Biometric and Genetics, Faculty of Agriculture, Bingol University,Turkey"},{"author_name":"Handan Ankarali","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul Medeniyet University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ozge Pasin","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Isabelle Eckerle","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Fiona Yamamoto","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kanagavel Murugesan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jason Kurzer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A.

There are variations in how much testing has been done across countries. South Korea, Germany, and Iceland take the bet of massive testing of their population. Whereas tests were not performed widely in southern European countries. As the former undergo a lower case-fatality rate due to the COVID-19 than the latter, the impact of the testing strategy must be investigated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of testing on the case fatality rate. Methods We use data on inpatients across French geographic areas and propose a novel methodology that exploits policy discontinuities at region borders to estimate the effect of COVID-19 tests on the case-fatality rate. In France, testing policies are determined locally. We compare all contiguous department pairs located on the opposite sides of a region border. The heterogeneity in testing rate between department pairs together with the similarities in other dimensions allow us to mimic the existence of treatment and control groups and to identify the impact of testing on mortality. Results The increase of one percentage point in the test rate is associated with a decrease of 0.001 percentage point in the death rate. In other words, for each additional 1000 tests, one person would have remained alive. Conclusion Massive population testing could have a significant effect on mortality in different ways. Mass testing may help decision-makers to implement healthcare measures to limit the spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony Terriau","author_inst":"GAINS -Le Mans University"},{"author_name":"Julien Albertini","author_inst":"GATES - Lyon 2 University"},{"author_name":"Arthur Poirier","author_inst":"GAINS -Le Mans University"},{"author_name":"Quentin LE BASTARD","author_inst":"Nantes University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Eckerle","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Fiona Yamamoto","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kanagavel Murugesan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jason Kurzer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A.

To unravel the clinical heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these patients, we designed the prospective observational Maastricht Intensive Care COVID cohort; MaastrICCht. We incorporated serial measurements that harbour aetiological, diagnostic and predictive information. The study aims to investigate the heterogeneity of the natural course of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study population: Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the Intensive Care with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main message: We will collect clinical variables, vital parameters, laboratory variables, mechanical ventilator settings, chest electrical impedance tomography, electrocardiograms, echocardiography as well as other imaging modalities to assess heterogeneity of the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in critically ill patients. The MaastrICCht cohort is, also designed to foster various other studies and registries and intends to create an open-source database for investigators. Therefore, a major part of the data collection is aligned with an existing national Intensive Care data registry and two international COVID-19 data collection initiatives. Additionally, we create a flexible design, so that additional measures can be added during the ongoing study based on new knowledge obtained from the rapidly growing body of evidence. Conclusion: The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic requires the swift implementation of observational research to unravel heterogeneity of the natural course of the disease of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mechanically ventilated patients. Our design is expected to enhance aetiological, diagnostic and prognostic understanding of the disease. This paper describes the design of the MaastrICCht cohort.","rel_num_authors":43,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeanette Tas","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Rob J.J. van Gassel","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Serge J.H. heines","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Mark M.G.

However, with the increasing demand for protection, face masks are becoming limited in stock, and the concerned individuals and healthcare workers from many countries are now facing the issue of the reuse of potentially contaminated masks. Although various technologies already exist for the sterilization of medical equipment, most of them are not applicable for eliminating virus from face masks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a fast and easy method of disinfecting contaminated face masks. In this study, using a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination on face masks, we show that the virus loses its infectivity to a human cell line (MRC-5) when exposed for a short period of time (1 min) to ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator. Scanning electron microscopy and particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) tests revealed that there was no structural or functional deterioration observed in the face masks even after they underwent excessive exposure to ozone (five 1-minute exposures). Interestingly, for face masks exposed to ozone gas for 5 min, the amplification of HCoV-229E RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction suggested a loss of infectivity under the effect of ozone, primarily owing to the damage caused to viral envelopes or envelope proteins. Ozone gas is a strong oxidizing agent with the ability to kill viruses on hard-to-reach surfaces, including the fabric structure of face masks. These results suggest that it may be possible to rapidly disinfect contaminated face masks using a plasma generator in a well-ventilated place.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinyeop Lee","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Cheolwoo Bong","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Pan K.

Valproic acid (VPA) has shown anti-inflammatory activity and mild intrinsic antiviral effect. These properties warrant the study of VPA as a possible active treatment in persons with severe COVID-19. Methods: Consecutive adult patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) will be given intravenous (i.v.) VPA at a starting dose of 20 mg\/kg\/day and up to 60\/kg\/day (in 60 min i.v. infusions in 250 mL normal saline) as needed to reach plasma VPA concentrations of 50-100 mcg\/mL (measured every 72 h). These patients will be followed-up for 10 days for the primary outcome and for a further period of 30 days after treatment completion for the secondary outcome of recurrence. The primary study outcome is the reduction in the case fatality rate of at least 50% after 10 days of treatment (as compared with natural history). Secondary outcomes are the reduction of length of stay (LOS) of at least 50%, as well as COVID-19 recurrence at 30-day follow-up. The most important safety outcomes are acute liver failure, acute pancreatitis, and thrombocytopenia. Conclusion: Although long-term adverse effects and even pro-inflammatory consequences have been reported with the chronic use of VPA, given the urgent need for a drug against COVID-19 to shorten the high mortality and LOS, the study of VPA is justified from a scientific standpoint.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erwin Chiquete","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Liz Toapanta-Yanchapaxi","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cantu-Brito","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Abdurhaman T.

COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, has evolved into a global pandemic with more than 2,900,000 people infected. It has had an acute and dramatic impact on health care systems, economies, and societies of affected countries within these few months. Widespread testing and tracing efforts are employed in many countries in order to contain and mitigate this pandemic. Recent data has indicated that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is common, and that the virus can be detected in wastewater. This indicates that wastewater monitoring is a potentially efficient tool for epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in large populations at relevant scales. Collecting raw sewage data, representing specific districts, and crosslinking this data with the number of infected people from each location, will enable us to derive and provide quantitative surveillance tools. In particular, this will provide important means to (i) estimate the extent of outbreaks and their spatial distributions, based primarily on in-sewer measurements (ii) manage the early-warning system quantitatively and efficiently (and similarly, verify disease elimination). Here we report the development of a virus concentration method using PEG or alum, providing an important a tool for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage and relating it to the local populations and geographic information. This will provide a proof of concept for the use of sewage associated virus data as a reliable epidemiological tool.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Itay Bar Or","author_inst":"Central virology lab, Ministry of health, Sheba medical center, Israel"},{"author_name":"Karin Yaniv","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel."},{"author_name":"Marilou Shagan","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel."},{"author_name":"Eden Ozer","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Oran Erster","author_inst":"Central virology lab, Ministry of health, Sheba medical center, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ella Mendelson","author_inst":"Central virology lab, Ministry of health, Sheba medical center, Israel and School of Public Health, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, "},{"author_name":"Batya Mannasse","author_inst":"Central virology lab, Ministry of health, Sheba medical center, Israel"},{"author_name":"Rachel Shirazi","author_inst":"Central virology lab, Ministry of health, Sheba medical center, Israel"},{"author_name":"Esti Kramarsky-Winter","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel."},{"author_name":"Oded Nir","author_inst":"Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research (ZIWR), Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boker, 84990, Israel"},{"author_name":"Hala Abu-Ali","author_inst":"Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research (ZIWR), Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boker, 84990, Israel"},{"author_name":"Zeev Ronen","author_inst":"Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research (ZIWR), Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boker, 84990, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ehud Rinott","author_inst":"Faculty of Health Science, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yair E.
