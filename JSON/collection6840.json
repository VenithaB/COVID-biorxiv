The different national governments have problems evaluating the reach of the epidemic, having limited resources and tests at their disposal. Hence, any means to evaluate the number of persons with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 with reasonable level of accuracy is useful. In this paper we present the initial results of the @CoronaSurveys project. The objective of this project is the collection and publication of data concerning the number of people that show symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in different countries using open anonymous surveys. While this data may be biased, we conjecture that it is still useful to estimate the number of infected persons with the COVID-19 virus at a given point in time in these countries, and the evolution of this number over time. We show here the initial results of the @CoronaSurveys project in Spain and Portugal.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Baquero","author_inst":"U.

Objective: To assess the characteristics of articles published during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with articles published during 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic. Data sources: Articles on COVID-19 and on H1N1 swine influenza indexed in PubMed (Medline) during the first 3 months of these pandemics. Study selection: Any article published in the respective study periods that included any terminology related to COVID-19 or H1N1 in the title, abstract or full-text was eligible for inclusion. Articles that did not present an English abstract, as well as correspondence to previous research and erratum were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two operators conducted the selection of articles and data extraction procedures independently. The article is reported following STROBE guidelines for observational studies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of primary and secondary articles. Prevalence of reporting of limitations in the abstracts. Results: Of the 2482 articles retrieved, 1165 were included. Approximately half of them were secondary articles (575, 49.4%). Common primary articles were: human medical research (340, 59.1%), in silico studies (182, 31.7%) and in vitro studies (26, 4.5%). Of the human medical research, the vast majority were observational studies and cases series, followed by single case reports and one randomized controlled trial. Secondary articles were mainly reviews, viewpoints and editorials (373, 63.2%). The second largest category was guidelines or guidance articles, including 193 articles (32.7%), of which 169 were indications for specific departments, patients or procedures. Limitations were reported in 42 out of 1165 abstracts (3.6%), with 10 abstracts reporting actual methodological limitations. In a similar timeframe in 2009 there were 223 articles published on the H1N1 pandemic. As compared to that pandemic, during COVID-19 there were higher chances to publish reviews and guidance articles and lower chances to publish in vitro and animal research studies. Conclusions and Relevance: As compared to the most recent pandemic, there is an overwhelming amount of information published on COVID-19. However, the majority of the articles published do not add significant information, possibly diluting the original information published. Also, only a negligible number of published articles reports limitations in the abstracts, hindering a rapid interpretation of their shortcomings.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Di Girolamo","author_inst":"Oklahoma State University"},{"author_name":"Reint Meursinge Reynders","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Antonio Fernandez Anta","author_inst":"IMDEA Networks Institute"},{"author_name":"Davide Frey","author_inst":"Inria Rennes, France"},{"author_name":"Augusto Garcia-Agundez","author_inst":"TU Darmstadt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chryssis Georgiou","author_inst":"U.

By staying home, people reduce the probability of contacting an infectious individual, becoming infected, and passing on the virus. One of the most promising sources of data on time use is smartphone location data. We develop a time use driven proportional mixing SEIR model that naturally incorporates time spent at home measured using smartphone location data and allows people of different health statuses to behave differently. We simulate epidemics in almost every county in the United States. The model suggests that Americans' behavioral shifts have reduced cases in 55%-86% of counties and for 71%-91% of the population, depending on modeling assumptions. Resuming pre-epidemic behavior would lead to a rapid rise in cases in most counties. Spatial patterns of bending and flattening the curve are robust to modeling assumptions. Depending on epidemic history, county demographics, and behavior within a county, returning those with acquired immunity (assuming it exists) to regular schedules generally helps reduce cumulative COVID-19 cases. The model robustly identifies which counties would experience the greatest share of case reduction relative to continued distancing behavior. The model occasionally mischaracterizes epidemic patterns in counties tightly connected to larger counties that are experiencing large epidemics. Understanding these patterns is critical for prioritizing testing resources and back-to-work planning for the United States.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eli P Fenichel","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Berry","author_inst":"University of Alaska, Anchorage"},{"author_name":"Jude Bayham","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Gregg Gonsalves","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Augusto Garcia-Agundez","author_inst":"TU Darmstadt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chryssis Georgiou","author_inst":"U.

Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the US and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Guido Espana","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Jude Bayham","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Gregg Gonsalves","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Augusto Garcia-Agundez","author_inst":"TU Darmstadt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chryssis Georgiou","author_inst":"U.

Methods To project the final infection numbers in Bangladesh we used the SIR mathematical model. Confirmed cases of infection data were obtained from Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh Results The confirmed cases in Bangladesh follow our SIR model prediction cases. By the end of April the predicted cases of infection will be 17450 to 21616 depending on the control strategies. Due to large population and socio-economic characteristics, we assumed 60% social distancing and lockdown can be possible. Assuming that, the predicated final size of infections will be 3782558 on the 92th day from the first infections and steadily decrease to zero infection after 193 days Conclusion To estimate the impact of social distancing we assumed eight different scenarios, the predicted results confirmed the positive impact of this type of control strategies suggesting that by strict social distancing and lockdown, COVID-19 infection can be under control and then the infection cases will steadily decrease down to zero.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Mahmudur Rahman","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnology, Bangladesh University of Health Sciences, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Asif Ahmed","author_inst":"Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline, Khulna Univesity, Khulna, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Khondoker Moazzem Hossain","author_inst":"Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tasnima Haque","author_inst":"BIHS General Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

Here we established a quantitative fusion assay dependent on SARS-CoV-2 S protein, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and found that nafamostat mesylate potently inhibited the fusion while camostat mesylate was about 10-fold less active. Furthermore, nafamostat mesylate blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells with an EC50 around 10 nM, which is below its average blood concentration after intravenous administration through continuous infusion. These findings, together with accumulated clinical data regarding its safety, make nafamostat a likely candidate drug to treat COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mizuki Yamamoto","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Maki Kiso","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Yuko Sakai-Tagawa","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Kiyoko Iwatsuki-Horimoto","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Masaki Imai","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Makoto Takeda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Noriko Kinoshita","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine"},{"author_name":"Norio Ohmagari","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jin Gohda","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Semba","author_inst":"Waseda University"},{"author_name":"Zene Matsuda","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Kawaguchi","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jun-ichiro Inoue","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.21.054122","rel_title":"Population genomics insights into the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.054122","rel_abs":"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is still spreading rapidly worldwide. Full-genome-sequence computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome will allow us to understand the recent evolutionary events and adaptability mechanisms more accurately, as there is still neither effective therapeutic nor prophylactic strategy. In this study, we used population genetics analysis to infer the mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, we localized targets of recent and strong positive selection. The genomic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely co-localized with regions in which recombination from non-human hosts appeared to have taken place in the past. Our results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, we find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts using a linkage disequilibrium analysis. In addition, we employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European, Asian and Northern American cohorts, and we demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Vasilarou","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH); Department of Biology, University of Crete, Cret"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Alachiotis","author_inst":"Institute of Computer Science (ICS), Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH); Technical University of Crete, Crete, Greece."},{"author_name":"Joanna Garefalaki","author_inst":"Institute of Computer Science (ICS), Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH)"},{"author_name":"Apostolos Beloukas","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of West Attica, Athens, Greece; Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK."},{"author_name":"Pavlos Pavlidis","author_inst":"Foundation for Research and Technology, Hellas"},{"author_name":"Makoto Takeda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Noriko Kinoshita","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine"},{"author_name":"Norio Ohmagari","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jin Gohda","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Semba","author_inst":"Waseda University"},{"author_name":"Zene Matsuda","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Kawaguchi","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jun-ichiro Inoue","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.21.054015","rel_title":"TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection of human small intestinal enterocytes","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.054015","rel_abs":"Both gastrointestinal symptoms and fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been frequently observed in COVID-19 patients.

In addition to TMPRSS2, another mucosa-specific serine protease, TMPRSS4, also enhanced SARS-CoV-2 spike fusogenic activity and mediated viral entry into host cells. However, newly synthesized viruses released into the intestinal lumen were rapidly inactivated by human colonic fluids and no infectious virus was recovered from the stool specimens of COVID-19 patients.

An analysis of amino acid variation in SARS-CoV-2 ORFs provided evidence of substitution events in the viral proteins involved in both host-entry and genome replication. The systematic monitoring of dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of circulating virus populations over time can guide therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to manage and contain the virus and, also, with available efficacious antivirals and vaccines, aid in the monitoring of circulating genetic diversity as we proceed towards elimination of the agent.

Considering close human-wildlife contact with many species in and beyond the region, a better understanding of virus diversity is urgently needed for the mitigation of future risks.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David J McIver","author_inst":"Metabiota Inc"},{"author_name":"Soubanh Silithammavong","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Watthana Theppangna","author_inst":"National Animal Health Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Amethyst Gillis","author_inst":"Metabiota Inc"},{"author_name":"Bounlom Douangngeun","author_inst":"National Animal Health Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Kongsy Khammavong","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Sinpakone Singhalath","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Veasna Duong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur du Cambodge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Buchy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur du Cambodge"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Olson","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Lucy Keatts","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Amanda E Fine","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Zoe Greatorex","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Martin Gilbert","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Matthew LeBreton","author_inst":"Mosaic"},{"author_name":"Karen Saylors","author_inst":"Labyrinth Global Health, Inc."},{"author_name":"Damien O Joly","author_inst":"British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy"},{"author_name":"Edward M Rubin","author_inst":"Metabiota Inc."},{"author_name":"Christian E Lange","author_inst":"Metabiota"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.057810","rel_title":"TARGETED PROTEOMICS FOR THE DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2 PROTEINS.","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.057810","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by fast and unambiguous testing is widely recognized to be critical in responding the current outbreak. Since the current testing capacity by conventional PCR based methods is insufficient because of shortages of supplies such as RNA extraction kits and PCR reagents, alternative and\/or complementary testing assays should be developed. Here, we exploit the potential of targeted mass spectrometry based proteomic technologies to solve the current issue of insufficient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing capacity. We have assessed the limit of detection by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer for target tryptic peptides of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins from a sample of virus infected Vero cells. For Nucleocapsid protein the limit of detection was found to be in the mid-attomole range (0.9 x 10-12 g), which would theoretically correspond to approximately 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles, under the assumption that all viral proteins are assembled in macromolecular virus particles. Whether or not this sensitivity is sufficient to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient material such as swabs or body fluids largely depends on the amount of viral proteins present in such samples and is subject of further research. If yes, mass spectrometry based methods could serve as a complementary protein based diagnostic tool and further steps should be focused on sample preparation protocols and on improvements in sample throughput.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karel Bezstarosti","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mart M Lamers","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeroen AA Demmers","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bounlom Douangngeun","author_inst":"National Animal Health Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Kongsy Khammavong","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Sinpakone Singhalath","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Veasna Duong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur du Cambodge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Buchy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur du Cambodge"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Olson","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Lucy Keatts","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Amanda E Fine","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Zoe Greatorex","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Martin Gilbert","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Matthew LeBreton","author_inst":"Mosaic"},{"author_name":"Karen Saylors","author_inst":"Labyrinth Global Health, Inc."},{"author_name":"Damien O Joly","author_inst":"British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy"},{"author_name":"Edward M Rubin","author_inst":"Metabiota Inc."},{"author_name":"Christian E Lange","author_inst":"Metabiota"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.046565","rel_title":"Functional and Genetic Analysis of Viral Receptor ACE2 Orthologs Reveals Broad Potential Host Range of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.046565","rel_abs":"The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major global health threat. Epidemiological studies suggest that bats are the natural zoonotic reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. However, the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and intermediate hosts that facilitate its transmission to humans remain unknown. The interaction of coronavirus with its host receptor is a key genetic determinant of host range and cross-species transmission. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter host cells in a species-dependent manner. It has been shown that human, palm civet, pig and bat ACE2 can support virus entry, while the murine ortholog cannot. In this study, we characterized the ability of ACE2 from diverse species to support viral entry. We found that ACE2 is expressed in a wide range of species, with especially high conservation in mammals. By analyzing amino acid residues of ACE2 critical for virus entry, based on structure of SARS-CoV spike protein interaction with human, bat, palm civet, pig and ferret ACE2, we identified approximately eighty ACE2 proteins from mammals that could potentially mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Functional assays showed that 44 of these mammalian ACE2 orthologs, including those of domestic animals, pets, livestock, and animals commonly found in zoos and aquaria, could bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. In contrast, New World monkey ACE2 orthologs could not bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. We further identified the genetic determinant of New World monkey ACE2 that restricts viral entry using genetic and functional analyses. In summary, our study demonstrates that ACE2 from a remarkably broad range of species can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry. These findings highlight a potentially broad host tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be distributed much more widely than previously recognized, underscoring the necessity to monitor susceptible hosts to prevent future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yinghui Liu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Gaowei Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Zhao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Fansen Ji","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Wenlin Ren","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Mingli Gong","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Ju","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Changhe Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Junxian Hong","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yuanfei Zhu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Wu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xun Lan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.057265","rel_title":"Structural and biochemical characterization of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 core polymerase complex from COVID-19 virus","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.057265","rel_abs":"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused huge number of human deaths.

As testing has scaled across the world, supply chain challenges have emerged across this entire workflow. Here we sought to evaluate how eliminating the UTM storage and RNA extraction steps would impact the results of molecular testing. Using paired mid-turbinate swabs self-collected by 11 individuals with previously established SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we performed a comparison of conventional (swab [-&gt;] UTM [-&gt;] RNA extraction [-&gt;] RT-qPCR) vs. simplified (direct elution from dry swab [-&gt;] RT-qPCR) protocols. Our results suggest that dry swabs eluted directly into a simple buffered solution (TE) can support molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 via endpoint RT-qPCR without substantially compromising sensitivity. Although further confirmation with a larger sample size and variation of other parameters is necessary, these results are encouraging for the possibility of a simplified workflow that could support massively scaled testing for COVID-19 control.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanjay Srivatsan","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Katrina van Raay","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Denise J McCulloch","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ashley E Kim","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Beth Martin","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jase Gehring","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Sriram Kosuri","author_inst":"Octant, Inc, University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Eric Q Konnick","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Christina M Lockwood","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Reider","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jay Shendure","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lea M Starita","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.21.054387","rel_title":"Identification of potential treatments for COVID-19 through artificial intelligence-enabled phenomic analysis of human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.054387","rel_abs":"To identify potential therapeutic stop-gaps for SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated a library of 1,670 approved and reference compounds in an unbiased, cellular image-based screen for their ability to suppress the broad impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on phenomic profiles of human renal cortical epithelial cells using deep learning.

Its efficient transmission and range of disease severity raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase and the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Numerous reports describe ACE2 mRNA abundance and tissue distribution; however, mRNA abundance is not always representative of protein levels. Currently, there is limited data evaluating ACE2 protein and its correlation with other SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility factors.\n\nMaterials and methodsWe systematically examined the human upper and lower respiratory tract using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to determine receptor expression and evaluated its association with risk factors for severe COVID-19.\n\nFindingsOur results reveal that ACE2 protein is highest within regions of the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development, respectively. In the lung parenchyma, ACE2 protein was found on the apical surface of a small subset of alveolar type II cells and colocalized with TMPRSS2, a cofactor for SARS-CoV2 entry. ACE2 protein was not increased by pulmonary risk factors for severe COVID-19.\n\nAdditionally, ACE2 protein was not reduced in children, a demographic with a lower incidence of severe COVID-19.\n\nInterpretationThese results offer new insights into ACE2 protein localization in the human respiratory tract and its relationship with susceptibility factors to COVID-19.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrevious studies of ACE2 mRNA transcript abundance in the human respiratory tract have suggested a possible association between ACE2 expression and age, sex, and the presence of comorbidities. However, these studies have provided conflicting results, as well as a lack of protein validation. Previous ACE2 protein studies have been limited by a paucity of lung tissue samples and reports that have produced contradictory results.\n\nAdded value of this studyUsing a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry, we describe ACE2 expression in the human respiratory tract. Staining protocols were optimized and validated to show consistent apical localization and avoid non-specific staining. We show ACE2 protein is found in subsets of airway cells and is highest within regions of the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development for COVID-19, respectively. We show age, sex, and comorbidities do not increase ACE2 protein expression in the human respiratory tract.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceACE2 protein abundance does not correlate with risk factors for severe clinical outcomes, but in some cases showed an inversed relationship.

We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID-19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated. Methods We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow-up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population. Findings Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID-19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22-33 contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests\/million population per week using 1\/16 pooling of samples. Interpretation Screening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kamalini Lokuge","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Emily Banks","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Leslee Roberts","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Tatum Street","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Grazia Caleo","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Glass","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Christine Wohlford-Lenane","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Paul B McCray Jr.","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"David K Meyerholz","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Mason L.

Methods: We conducted a primary survey of 638 adults in Brazil on March 25-28, 2020, about one month (32 days) after the first COVID-19 case in South America was confirmed in Sao Paulo. Results: In Brazil, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or moderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were female, younger, more educated, and exercised less report-ed higher levels of distress. The distance from the Brazilian epicenter of Sao Paulo inter-acted with age and workplace attendance to predict the level of distress. The typhoon eye effect was stronger for people who were older or attended their workplace less.

OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a predication model, presented as nomogram and scale, to distinguish infectious acute abdomen patients suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN Diagnostic model based on retrospective case series. SETTING Two hospitals in Wuhan and Beijing, China. PTRTICIPANTS 584 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 2 Jan 2020 to15 Feb 2020 and 238 infectious acute abdomen patients receiving emergency operation from 28 Feb 2019 to 3 Apr 2020. METHODS LASSO regression and multivariable logistic regression analysis were conducted to develop the prediction model in training cohort. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves in training and validation cohort. A simplified screening scale and managing algorithm was generated according to the nomogram. RESULTS Six potential COVID-19 prediction variables were selected and the variable abdominal pain was excluded for overmuch weight. The five potential predictors, including fever, chest computed tomography (CT), leukocytes (white blood cells, WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), were all independent predictors in multivariable logistic regression analysis (p[&le;]0.001) and the nomogram, named COVID-19 Infectious Acute Abdomen Distinguishment (CIAAD) nomogram, was generated. The CIAAD nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration (C-index of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.963 to 0.999) and AUC of 0.970 (95% CI, 0.961 to 0.982)), which was validated in the validation cohort (C-index of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.960 to 0.972) and AUC of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.957 to 0.975)). Decision curve analysis revealed that the CIAAD nomogram was clinically useful. The nomogram was further simplified into the CIAAD scale. CONCLUSIONS We established an easy and effective screening model and scale for surgeons in emergency department to distinguish COVID-19 patients from infectious acute abdomen patients. The algorithm based on CIAAD scale will help surgeons manage infectious acute abdomen patients suspected COVID-19 more efficiently.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bangbo Zhao","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yingxin Wei","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenwu Sun","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Cheng Qin","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xingtong Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tianhao Li","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongtao Cao","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weibin Wang","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yujun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mason L.

Clinical studies on COVID-19 performed in mainland China were included. We collected primary outcomes including signs and symptoms, chest CT imaging, laboratory tests, and treatments. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Qualitative and quantitative synthesis was conducted, and random-effects models were applied to pooled estimates. This study is registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42020171606). Of the 3624 records identified, 147 studies (20,662 patients) were analyzed. The mean age of patients with COVID-19 was 49.40 years, 53.45% were male, and 38.52% had at least one comorbidity. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, followed by fatigue, expectoration, and shortness of breath. Most patients with COVID-19 had abnormal chest CT findings with ground glass opacity (70.70%) or consolidation (29.91%). Laboratory findings shown lymphopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased infection-related indicators, and fibrinolytic hyperactivity. Antiviral therapy, antibiotic therapy, and corticosteroids were administered to 89.75%, 79.13%, and 35.64% of patients, respectively. Most clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are non-specific. Patients with suspected should be evaluated by virological assays and clinically treated.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chong Tang","author_inst":"Peking university shougang hospital"},{"author_name":"Keshi Zhang","author_inst":"Peking university shougang hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenlong Wang","author_inst":"Peking university shougang hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Pei","author_inst":"Peking university shougang hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Liu","author_inst":"Peking university shougang hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Yuan","author_inst":"Peking university shougang hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhenpeng Guan","author_inst":"Peking university shougang hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin Gu","author_inst":"Peking university shougang hospital"},{"author_name":"Rosemary Vergara","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Taylor Hollis","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Laura J Simpson","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Philip Grant","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Aruna Subramanian","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jay Shendure","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lea M Starita","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20070920","rel_title":"Trends of SARS-Cov-2 infection in 67 countries: Role of climate zone, temperature, humidity and curve behavior of cumulative frequency on duplication time","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20070920","rel_abs":"Summary Objective. To analyze the role of temperature, humidity, date of first case diagnosed (DFC) and the behavior of the growth-curve of cumulative frequency (CF) [number of days to rise (DCS) and reach the first 100 cases (D100), and the difference between them ({Delta}DD)] with the doubling time (Td) of Covid-19 cases in 67 countries grouped by climate zone. Design. Retrospective incident case study. Setting. WHO based register of cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases. Participants. 1,706,914 subjects diagnosed between 12-29-2019 and 4-15-2020. Exposures. SARS-Cov-2 virus, ambient humidity, temperature and climate areas (temperate, tropical\/subtropical). Main outcome measures. Comparison of DCS, D100, {Delta}DD, DFC, humidity, temperature, Td for the first (Td10) and second (Td20) ten days of the CF growth-curve between countries according to climate zone, and identification of factors involved in Td, as well as predictors of CF using lineal regression models. Results. Td10 and Td20 were [&ge;]3 days longer in tropical\/subtropical vs. temperate areas (2.8[plusmn]1.2 vs. 5.7[plusmn]3.4; p=1.41E-05 and 4.6[plusmn]1.8 vs. 8.6[plusmn]4.2; p=9.7E-05, respectively). The factors involved in Td10 (DFC and {Delta}DD) were different than those in Td20 (Td10 and climate areas). After D100, the fastest growth-curves during the first 10 days, were associated with Td10<2 and Td10<3 in temperate and tropical\/subtropical countries, respectively. The fold change Td20\/Td10 >2 was associated with earlier flattening of the growth-curve. In multivariate models, Td10, DFC and ambient temperature were negatively related with CF and explained 44.7% (r2 = 0.447) of CF variability at day 20 of the growth-curve, while Td20 and DFC were negatively related with CF and explained 63.8% (r2 = 0.638) of CF variability towards day 30 of the growth-curve. Conclusions. The larger Td in tropical\/subtropical countries is positively related to DFC and temperature. Td and environmental factors explain 64% of CF variability in the best of cases. Therefore, other factors, such as pandemic containment measures, would explain the remaining variability.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaime Berumen","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Max Schmulson","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Guadalupe Guerrero","author_inst":"Hospital General de Mexico, Dr. Eduardo Liceaga, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Barrera","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Jorge Larriva-Sahd","author_inst":"Instituto de Neurobiologia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Campus Juriquilla, Queretaro Mexico"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Olaiz","author_inst":"Centro de Investigacion en politicas, poblacion y salud, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rebeca Garcia-Leyva","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rosa M Wong-Chew","author_inst":"Division de Investigacion, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Miguel Betancourt-Cravioto","author_inst":"Fundacion Carlos Slim, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Hector Gallardo","author_inst":"Fundacion Carlos Slim, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"German Fajardo-Dolci","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Roberto Tapia-Conyer","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Aruna Subramanian","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jay Shendure","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lea M Starita","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20070912","rel_title":"An empirical estimate of the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 from the first Italian outbreak","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20070912","rel_abs":"Background: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been spread-ing globally for months, yet the infection fatality ratio of the disease is still uncertain. This is partly because of inconsistencies in testing and death reporting standards across countries. Our purpose is to provide accurate estimates which do not rely on testing and death count data directly but only use population level statistics. Methods: We collected demographic and death records data from the Italian Institute of Statistics. We focus on the area in Italy that experienced the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and estimated a Bayesian model fitting age-stratified mortality data from 2020 and previous years. We also assessed the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative assumptions on the proportion of population infected. Findings: We estimate an overall infection fatality rate of 1.31% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.94-1.89), as well as large differences by age, with a low infection fatality rate of 0.05% for under 60 year old (CrI 0-0.17) and a substantially higher 4.16% (CrI 3.05-5.80) for people above 60 years of age. In our sensitivity analysis, we found that even under extreme assumptions, our method delivered useful information. For instance, even if only 10% of the population were infected, the infection fatality rate would not rise above 0.2% for people under 60. Finally, using data on demographics we show large expected heterogeneity in overall IFR across countries. Interpretation: Our empirical estimates based on population level data show a sharp difference in fatality rates between young and old people and firmly rule out overall fatality ratios below 0.5% in populations with more than 30% over 60 years old.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianluca Rinaldi","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Matteo Paradisi","author_inst":"NBER and EIEF"},{"author_name":"Guadalupe Guerrero","author_inst":"Hospital General de Mexico, Dr. Eduardo Liceaga, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Barrera","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Jorge Larriva-Sahd","author_inst":"Instituto de Neurobiologia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Campus Juriquilla, Queretaro Mexico"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Olaiz","author_inst":"Centro de Investigacion en politicas, poblacion y salud, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rebeca Garcia-Leyva","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rosa M Wong-Chew","author_inst":"Division de Investigacion, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Miguel Betancourt-Cravioto","author_inst":"Fundacion Carlos Slim, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Hector Gallardo","author_inst":"Fundacion Carlos Slim, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"German Fajardo-Dolci","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Roberto Tapia-Conyer","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Aruna Subramanian","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jay Shendure","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lea M Starita","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20071142","rel_title":"Is there evidence that BCG vaccination has non-specific protective effects for COVID 19 infections or is it an illusion created by lack of testing?","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20071142","rel_abs":"The goal of this paper is to showcase that the COVID-19 disease pattern is evolving and to study the relationship between mandatory BCG policy and caseload\/million or death\/per million.

We analyze data from 98 countries and we extend existing models by adding the dimension of COVID-19-related testing conducted by the analyzed countries. Similarly to prior studies, we find that COVID-19 attributable case and death incidences across countries share a relationship with the BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program of a country when testing is not taken into consideration. However, this relationship vanishes when we add the dimension of testing. We observe that case and death incidences conditional on testing do not get affected by the BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program of a country.

Methods: Between 30 March and 4 April 2020, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non-teaching staff of a high-school located in Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and\/or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings: Of the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6-29.4), and the infection fatality rate was 0% (one-sided 97.5% CI = 0-2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since mid-January were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4-9.8). Anosmia and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection (84.7% and 88.1%, respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers (7.2% versus 28.0%, P <0.001). The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0% (95% CI = 11.2-23.4). The proportion of donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the Oise department was 3.0% (95% CI = 1.1-6.4). Interpretation: The relatively low IAR observed in an area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that lifting these measures in France will be long and complex.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Laura Tondeur","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Yoann Madec","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Grant","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Camille Besombes","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Jolly","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Fernandes Pellerin","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cailleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kuhmel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sarah Temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Christele Huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Yu Chen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Crescenzo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandie Munier","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Gallian","author_inst":"Etablissement Francais du Sang"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20068072","rel_title":"COVID-19 Asymptomatic Infection Estimation","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20068072","rel_abs":"Background: Mounting evidence suggests that there is an undetected pool of COVID-19 asymptomatic but infectious cases. Estimating the number of asymptomatic infections has been crucial to understand the virus and contain its spread, which is, however, hard to be accurately counted. Methods: We propose an approach of machine learning based fine-grained simulator (MLSim), which integrates multiple practical factors including disease progress in the incubation period, cross-region population movement, undetected asymptomatic patients, and prevention and containment strength. The interactions among these factors are modeled by virtual transmission dynamics with several undetermined parameters, which are determined from epidemic data by machine learning techniques. When MLSim learns to match the real data closely, it also models the number of asymptomatic patients. MLSim is learned from the open Chinese global epidemic data. Findings: MLSim showed better forecast accuracy than the SEIR and LSTM-based prediction models. The MLSim learned from the data of China's mainland reveals that there could have been 150,408 (142,178-157,417) asymptomatic and had self-healed patients, which is 65% (64% - 65%) of the inferred total infections including undetected ones. The numbers of asymptomatic but infectious patients on April 15, 2020, were inferred as, Italy: 41,387 (29,037 - 57,151), Germany: 21,118 (11,484 - 41,646), USA: 354,657 (277,641 - 495,128), France: 40,379 (10,807 - 186,878), and UK: 144,424 (127,215 - 171,930). To control the virus transmission, the containment measures taken by the government were crucial. The learned MLSim also reveals that if the date of containment measures in China's mainland was postponed for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days later than Jan. 23, there would be 109,039 (129%), 183,930 (218%), 313,342 (371%), 537,555 (637%) confirmed cases on June 12. Conclusions: Machine learning based fine-grained simulators can better model the complex real-world disease transmission process, and thus can help decision-making of balanced containment measures. The simulator also revealed the potential great number of undetected asymptomatic infections, which poses a great risk to the virus containment.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Yu","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ren Liu","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Fan-Ming Luo","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Wei-Wei Tu","author_inst":"4Paradigm"},{"author_name":"De-Chuan Zhan","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Guo Yu","author_inst":"Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cailleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kuhmel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sarah Temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Christele Huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Yu Chen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Crescenzo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandie Munier","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Gallian","author_inst":"Etablissement Francais du Sang"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20070805","rel_title":"Epidemiological impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: mathematical modeling analyses","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20070805","rel_abs":"Background: Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are currently in the pipeline. This study aims to inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, licensure, decision-making, and implementation by determining key preferred vaccine product characteristics and associated population-level impact. Methods: Vaccination impact was assessed at various efficacies using an age-structured mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, with application for China. Results: A prophylactic vaccine with efficacy against acquisition (VEs) of [&ge;]70% is needed to eliminate this infection. A vaccine with VEs <70% will still have a major impact, and may control the infection if it reduces infectiousness or infection duration among those vaccinated who acquire the infection, or alternatively if supplemented with a moderate social-distancing intervention (<20% reduction in contact rate), or complemented with herd immunity. Vaccination is cost-effective. For a vaccine with VEs of 50%, number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection is only 2.4, one severe disease case is 25.5, one critical disease case is 33.2, and one death is 65.1. Gains in effectiveness are achieved by initially prioritizing those [&ge;]60 years. Probability of a major outbreak is virtually zero with a vaccine with VEs [&ge;]70%, regardless of number of virus introductions. Yet, an increase in social contact rate among those vaccinated (behavior compensation) can undermine vaccine impact. Conclusions: Even a partially-efficacious vaccine can offer a fundamental solution to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high cost-effectiveness. In addition to the primary endpoint on infection acquisition, developers should assess natural history and disease progression outcomes and\/or proxy biomarkers, since such secondary endpoints may prove critical in licensure, decision-making, and vaccine impact.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monia Makhoul","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Houssein H Ayoub","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Shaheen Seedat","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Ghina R Mumtaz","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Sarah Al-Omari","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cailleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kuhmel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sarah Temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Christele Huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Yu Chen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Crescenzo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandie Munier","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Gallian","author_inst":"Etablissement Francais du Sang"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20070771","rel_title":"Decline in global COVID-19 transmission","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20070771","rel_abs":"We analyzed COVID-19 data through May 6th, 2020 using a partially observed Markov process. Our method uses a hybrid deterministic and stochastic formalism that allows for time variable transmission rates and detection probabilities. The model was fit using iterated particle filtering to case count and death count time series from 55 countries. We found evidence for a shrinking epidemic in 30 of the 55 examined countries. Of those 30 countries, 27 have significant evidence for subcritical transmission rates, although the decline in new cases is relatively slow compared to the initial growth rates. Generally, the transmission rates in Europe were lower than in the Americas and Asia. This suggests that global scale social distancing efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 are effective although they need to be strengthened in many regions and maintained in others to avoid further resurgence of COVID-19. The slow decline also suggests alternative strategies to control the virus are needed before social distancing efforts are partially relaxed.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ethan Obie Romero-Severson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Grant Meadors","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ruian Ke","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ghina R Mumtaz","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Sarah Al-Omari","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cailleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kuhmel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sarah Temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Christele Huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Yu Chen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Crescenzo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandie Munier","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Gallian","author_inst":"Etablissement Francais du Sang"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20064394","rel_title":"COVID-19.

Less attention has been paid to the spread of respiratory droplets in outdoor environments under microclimatologic turbulent wind and which is of growing importance given the current COVID19 epidemic. We implement a computational model describing a sneezing person in an urban scenario under a medium intensity climatological wind. Turbulence was described with a wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulation model and the spread of respiratory droplets by using a lagrangian approach. Results show the spread of respiratory droplets is characterized by the dynamics of two groups of droplets of different sizes: larger droplets (400 - 900 m) are spread between 2-5 m during 2.3 s while smaller (100 - 200 m) droplets are transported a larger range between 8-11 m by the action of the turbulent wind in 14.1 s average. Given the uncertainty of potential contagion over this way and with this reach, these efforts are an intent to contribute to shine a light on the possibility of adopting stricter self-care and distancing measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Guerrero","author_inst":"MSET Chile SpA"},{"author_name":"Jose Brito","author_inst":"MSET Chile SpA"},{"author_name":"Pablo Cornejo","author_inst":"MSET Chile  SpA"},{"author_name":"Ruian Ke","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ghina R Mumtaz","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Sarah Al-Omari","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cailleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kuhmel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sarah Temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Christele Huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Yu Chen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Crescenzo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandie Munier","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Gallian","author_inst":"Etablissement Francais du Sang"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
