We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS Seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001). INTERPRETATION This large patient-based systematic review presents a more precise profiling of the COVID-19 from its outbreak to current pandemic. Dynamic evolvements of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhangfu Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Fang Yi","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kang Wu","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kefang Lai","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xizhuo Sun","author_inst":"Department of Respirology & Allergy.

Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Diao","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Kun Wen","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Yueping Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Zilin Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Chao Han","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Chen","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuxian Pan","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Shenzhen  Bioeasy  Biotechnology  Co.

While distinct from SARS-CoV, both group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization, origins to bat CoVs, and an arsenal of immune antagonists. In this report, we evaluate type-I interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication to SARS-CoV, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I. In Vero and in Calu3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 is substantially attenuated in the context of IFN-I pretreatment, while SARS-CoV is not. In line with these findings, SARS-CoV-2 fails to counteract phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of ISG proteins, while SARS-CoV is able to suppress both. Comparing SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in human airway epithelial cultures (HAEC), we observe the absence of IFN-I stimulation by SARS-CoV-2 alone, but detect failure to counteract STAT1 phosphorylation upon IFN-I pretreatment resulting in near ablation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we evaluated IFN-I treatment post infection and found SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive even after establishing infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonists. The absence of an equivalent open reading frame (ORF) 3b and changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN-I antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to IFN-I responses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that may help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.\n\nImportanceWith the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment options. In addition, these findings could have key implications for animal model development as well as further research into how SARS-CoV-2 modulates the type I IFN response early during infection.\n\nArticle SummarySARS-CoV-2 has similar replication kinetics to SARS-CoV, but demonstrates significant sensitivity to type I interferon treatment.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kumari G Lokugamage","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Adam Hage","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Maren Devries","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana M Vallero-Jimenez","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Schindewolf","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Meike Dittmann","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rajsbaum","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Shenzhen  Bioeasy  Biotechnology  Co.

Methods: Articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database, and google up-to 24 February 2020 were systematically reviewed. Eighteen Literatures were identified with cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. The extracted data includes clinical symptoms, age, gender, sample size and region et al were systematic reviewed and meta analyzed. Results: 14 eligible studies including 1,424 patients were analyzed. Symptoms like fever (89.2%), cough (67.2%), fatigue (43.6%) were common, dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominal pain and conjunctival congestion\/conjunctivitis were rare. Polypnea\/dyspnea in severe patients were significantly higher than non-severe (42.7% vs.16.3%, P<0.0001). Fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients(p=0.0374and0.0267). Further meta-analysis showed incidence of fever(OR1.70,95%CI 1.01-2.87), polypnea\/dyspnea(OR3.53, 95%CI 1.95-6.38) and diarrhea(OR1.80,95%CI 1.06-3.03) was higher in severe patients, which meant the severe risk of patients with fever, polypnea\/dyspnea, diarrhea were 1.70, 3.53, 1.80 times higher than those with no corresponding symptoms. Conclusions: Fever, cough and fatigue are common symptoms in COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with non-severe patients, the symptoms as fever, polypnea\/dyspnea and diarrhea are potential symptoms lead to severity.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weiping Ji","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Gautam Bishnu","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xudong Du","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xinxin Chen","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Hui Xu","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Guo","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Zhenzhai Cai","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xian Shen","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Diagnosis Chongqing Public Health Medical Center Public Health Hospital of Southwest University Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.20031971","rel_title":"Sensitive one-step isothermal detection of pathogen-derived RNAs","rel_date":"2020-03-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.20031971","rel_abs":"The recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) require fast, simple, and sensitive onsite nucleic acid diagnostics that can be developed rapidly to prevent the spread of diseases. We have developed a SENsitive Splint-based one-step isothermal RNA detection (SENSR) method for rapid and straightforward onsite detection of pathogen RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We also show that the platform can be extended to the detection of five other pathogens. Overall, SENSR is a molecular diagnostic method that can be developed rapidly for onsite uses requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and short assaying times.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chang Ha Woo","author_inst":"Pohang University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sungho Jang","author_inst":"Pohang University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Giyoung Shin","author_inst":"Pohang University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gyoo Yeol Jung","author_inst":"Pohang University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jeong Wook Lee","author_inst":"Pohang University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui Xu","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Guo","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Zhenzhai Cai","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xian Shen","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Diagnosis Chongqing Public Health Medical Center Public Health Hospital of Southwest University Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.07.981928","rel_title":"Substrate specificity profiling of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease provides basis for anti-COVID-19 drug design","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.07.981928","rel_abs":"In December 2019, the first cases of infection with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of China. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); therefore, research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. To address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. On the basis of these findings, we designed and synthesized an inhibitor and two activity-based probes, for one of which we determined the crystal structure of its complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Using this approach we visualized SARS-CoV-2 active Mpro within nasopharyngeal epithelial cells of a patient with active COVID-19 infection. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents or diagnostic tests.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wioletta Rut","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Groborz","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Linlin Zhang","author_inst":"University of Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Xinyuanyuan Sun","author_inst":"University of Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Zmudzinski","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bartlomiej Pawlik","author_inst":"Medical University of Lodz"},{"author_name":"Wojciech Mlynarski","author_inst":"Medical University of Lodz"},{"author_name":"Rolf Hilgenfeld","author_inst":"University of Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Marcin Drag","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Diagnosis Chongqing Public Health Medical Center Public Health Hospital of Southwest University Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.06.20032144","rel_title":"CORONAVIRUS IN PREGNANCY AND DELIVERY: RAPID REVIEW AND EXPERT CONSENSUS","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.06.20032144","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date. The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward Mullins","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"RCPCH"},{"author_name":"Russell Viner","author_inst":"RCPCH"},{"author_name":"Patrick O'Brien","author_inst":"RCOG"},{"author_name":"Eddie Morris","author_inst":"RCOG"},{"author_name":"Bartlomiej Pawlik","author_inst":"Medical University of Lodz"},{"author_name":"Wojciech Mlynarski","author_inst":"Medical University of Lodz"},{"author_name":"Rolf Hilgenfeld","author_inst":"University of Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Marcin Drag","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Diagnosis Chongqing Public Health Medical Center Public Health Hospital of Southwest University Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.20032011","rel_title":"Amplicon based MinION sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic characterisation of nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.20032011","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a complex disease phenotype where the underlying microbiome could influence morbidity and mortality.

Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables. METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P < 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P < 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P < 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P < 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count, and so on. CONCLUSIONS The new developed COVID-19 EWS was a considerable tool for early and relatively accurately warning of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cong-Ying Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jia Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jian-Qin He","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Qiang Lu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Steven T Pullan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniel Carter","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bewley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Qin Zhao","author_inst":"Northwest A&F University"},{"author_name":"Yani Sun","author_inst":"Northwest A&F University"},{"author_name":"Catherine Hartley","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"En-min Zhou","author_inst":"Northwest A&F University"},{"author_name":"Tom Solomon","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Michael B.

This study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others. Methods: We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. Results: The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1{+\/-}3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period. Conclusions: The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole. Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Xia","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and

crucial for evaluating its spread pattern, especially in metropolitan areas of China, as its spread can lead to secondary outbreaks outside Wuhan, the center of the new coronavirus disease outbreak. In addition, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China have the potential to provide evidence to support other metropolitan areas and large cities outside China with emerging cases. We used data reported from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020, to fit a model of infection, estimate the likely number of infections in four high-risk metropolitan areas based on the number of cases reported, and increase the understanding of the COVID-19 spread pattern. Considering the effect of the official quarantine regulations and travel restrictions for China, which began January 23~24, 2020, we used the daily travel intensity index from the Baidu Maps app to roughly simulate the level of restrictions and estimate the proportion of the quarantined population. A group of SEIR model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fitting on the basis of reported data. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number, R0, was 2.91 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen based on the data from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different levels of parameters. For example, in Beijing, the predicted peak number of cases was approximately 466 with a peak time of February 29, 2020; however, if the city were to implement different levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results showed that the transmission dynamics would change and that the peak number of cases would differ by between 56% and ~159%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and that more rigorous control and prevention measures would effectively contain its further spread but that the risk will increase when businesses and social activities return to normal before the end of the epidemic. Besides, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China are potential to provide evidences supporting for other metropolitan areas and big cities with emerging cases outside China.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Longxiang Su","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Na Hong","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors on medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff from 10th February 2020 to 20th February 2020 in China using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal ([&le;]49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety ([&ge;]70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Results: Of 512 medical staff from China, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact ({beta}value=2.33, CI: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068). Similar things were observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China ({beta}value=3.67, CI: 1.44 -5.89; p=0.0013). The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases ({beta}value=4.44, CI: 1.55 -7.33; p=0.0028). Conclusion: Our results highlight that government authorities should make early detection of the high risk of anxiety among medical staff a priority, and implement appropriate psychological intervention programs, to prevent medical staff from developing psychological disorders that could potentially exert an adverse effect on combating the COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chenyun Liu","author_inst":"People 's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District"},{"author_name":"Yun-zhi Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of shenzhen baoan district"},{"author_name":"Xiao Ming Zhang","author_inst":"people's hospital of shenzhen baoan district"},{"author_name":"Xinying Xu","author_inst":"People's hospital of shenzhen baoan district"},{"author_name":"Qing-Li Dou","author_inst":"People's hospital of shenzhen baoan districtP"},{"author_name":"Wen-Wu Zhang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District"},{"author_name":"Lin Han","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak. In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05. Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Barbara Oliveiros","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra"},{"author_name":"Liliana Caramelo","author_inst":"Centre for the Research and Technology of Agro-Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Nuno C Ferreira","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra"},{"author_name":"Francisco Caramelo","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Qing-Li Dou","author_inst":"People's hospital of shenzhen baoan districtP"},{"author_name":"Wen-Wu Zhang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District"},{"author_name":"Lin Han","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Methods: This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. Results: The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. The closer COVID-19 is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. Compared with Nursing college students, nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to use Problem-focused coping. People may have a cycle of \"the more fear, the more problem-focused coping\". And people may \"The more angry, the more emotion-focused coping\", \"the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry, the more sadness\". Conclusion: COVID-19 is a pressure source with great influence, both for individuals and for the social public groups. Different individuals and groups may experience different levels of psychological crisis, and those nurses at the core of the incident are affected. Hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses and providing timely psychological assistance and training in coping strategies. Improving nurses' ability to regulate emotions and effective coping strategies, providing a strong guarantee for resolutely winning the battle against epidemic prevention and control.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Long Huang","author_inst":"Jiangxi normal university"},{"author_name":"Fu ming xu","author_inst":"Nanning normal university"},{"author_name":"Hai rong Liu","author_inst":"Wannan medical college"},{"author_name":"Francisco Caramelo","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Qing-Li Dou","author_inst":"People's hospital of shenzhen baoan districtP"},{"author_name":"Wen-Wu Zhang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District"},{"author_name":"Lin Han","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Conclusions: Estimating generation and serial interval distributions from outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying transmission network. Detailed contact tracing information is essential for correctly estimating these quantities.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tapiwa Ganyani","author_inst":"Hasselt University (UHasselt)"},{"author_name":"Cecile Kremer","author_inst":"Hasselt University (UHasselt)"},{"author_name":"Dongxuan Chen","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands; Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrea Torneri","author_inst":"Hasselt University (UHasselt); University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Christel Faes","author_inst":"Hasselt University (UHasselt)"},{"author_name":"Jacco Wallinga","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands; Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University; University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Fengxiang Chang","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions.

This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model. Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: <= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: >= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: <= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: >= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups ({chi}2 = 4.99 x 10-6, P > 0.999), and five age groups ({chi}2 = 4.85 x 10-6, P > 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zeyu Zhao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Zhao Zhu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jing-Wen Xu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qing-Qing Hu","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Zhao Lei","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jia Rui","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xingchun Liu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yao Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Li Luo","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shan-Shan Yu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jia Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Yun Liu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Fang Xie","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ying-Ying Su","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chen Chiang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yanhua Su","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Benhua Zhao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianmu Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofang Lin","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuting Cao","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shu Huan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiying Xiao","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fengyu Ruan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hanjin Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qing Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xingjuan Ding","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xingjie Fang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Feng Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Ma","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Aizhen Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuling Xing","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shunqing Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.06.20031880","rel_title":"Estimating the scale of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States: Simulations Based on Air Traffic directly from Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.06.20031880","rel_abs":"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been characterized by rapid spread and unusually large case clusters. It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to develop informed public health strategies. Methods: We estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03\/01\/2020) in the U.S. from cases imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03\/01\/2020 were also taken into account. We. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S. Results: With the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03\/01\/2020 if no intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474). Conclusion: Our research indicates that, as of 03\/01\/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the US infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the situation becomes clearer.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dalin Li","author_inst":"IBIRI institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jun Lv","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Botwin","author_inst":"IBIRI Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Braun","author_inst":"IBIRI Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Weihua Cao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Liming Li","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Dermot P.B.

However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients. Elevated CRP levels, underlying comorbidities, and NCP severity are the main risk factors for cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huayan

globally. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. We aimed to explore risk factors affecting susceptibility to infection and prioritize drug repositioning candidates, based on Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on ACE2 lung expression. We conducted a phenome-wide MR study to prioritize diseases\/traits and blood proteins causally linked to ACE2 lung expression in GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR, as these drugs may alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. The most consistent finding was tentative evidence of an association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), T2DM was causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (p=2.91E-03;MR-IVW). Significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) with ACE2 expression was observed across multiple DM datasets and analytic methods, for type 1 and 2 diabetes and related traits including early start of insulin. Other diseases\/traits having nominal significant associations with increased expression included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT. We also identified drugs that may target the top-ranked proteins in MR, such as fostamatinib and zinc. In conclusion, our analysis suggested that diabetes and related traits may increase ACE2 expression, which may influence susceptibility to infection (or more severe infection). However, none of these findings withstood rigorous multiple testing corrections (at FDR<0.05). Proteome-wide MR analyses might help uncover mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression and guide drug repositioning. Further studies are required to verify our findings.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shitao Rao","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Alexandria

essential parts of diagnostic workup for patients suspected for 2019-nCoV infection, Multiple studies have reported the features of chest computed tomography (CT) scans among a number of 2019-nCoV patients. Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I2-statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result. Results: According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively. Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation was seen in 86% but 14% had NO GGO or consolidation. The other rare CT symptoms were pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7% prevalence, respectively. The most prevalent event was Either GGO or consolidation in 85% of patients. Conclusion: The most CT-scan abnormality is Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation however in few patients none of them might be observed, so trusting in just CT findings will lead to miss some patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Golnaz Vaseghi","author_inst":"Isfahan Cardiovascular research center, cardiovascular research institute, Isfahan University of

China remains to be a serious challenge for frontline medical workers (fMW). They are under high risk of being infected and high mental stress, which may lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate sleep disturbances of fMW and made a comparison with non-fMW. The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, were volunteered to participate. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status of fMW. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>7 points or\/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted. Findings A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-fMW, fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (p<0.0001), AIS (p<0.0001), anxiety (p<0.0001) and depression (p=0.0010), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (p<0.0001) and AIS > 6 points (p<0.0001). In subgroup analysis, compared to male fMW, female fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (p=0.022) and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (p<0.0001). Interpretation fMW had higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-fMW. Female fMW were more vulnerable to having sleep disturbances than male fMW. Funding None.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Golnaz Vaseghi","author_inst":"Isfahan Cardiovascular research center, cardiovascular research institute, Isfahan University of
