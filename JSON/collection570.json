CR3022 is a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody to a highly conserved epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein that can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but with lower affinity. Using x-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and binding experiments, we illustrate that of four amino acid differences in the CR3022 epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, a single mutation P384A fully determines the affinity difference. CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but the increased affinity to SARS-CoV-2 P384A mutant now enables neutralization with a similar potency to SARS-CoV. We further investigated CR3022 interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein by negative-stain EM and cryo-EM. Three CR3022 Fabs bind per trimer with the RBD observed in different up-conformations due to considerable flexibility of the RBD. In one of these conformations, quaternary interactions are made by CR3022 to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of an adjacent subunit. Overall, this study provides insights into antigenic variation and potential for cross-neutralizing epitopes on SARS-like viruses.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas C.

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 as the receptor to enter host cell in a species-specific manner. We and others have previously shown that ACE2 orthologs from New World monkey, koala and mouse cannot interact with SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry, and this defect can be restored by humanization of the restrictive residues in New World monkey ACE2. To better understand the genetic determinants behind the ability of ACE2 orthologs to support viral entry, we compared koala and mouse ACE2 sequences with that of human and identified the key residues in koala and mouse ACE2 that restrict viral receptor activity. Humanization of these critical residues rendered both koala and mouse ACE2 capable of binding the spike protein and facilitating viral entry. The single mutation that allowed for mouse ACE2 to serve as a viral receptor provides a potential avenue for the development of SARS-CoV-2 mouse model.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenlin Ren","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Gaowei Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Zhao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongyang Shi","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jun Lan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yunkai Zhu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Wu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Devin J.

Therefore, we have started studying on the characteristics of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to know about the truth of infectious disease and our future. After detailed studies on the characteristics of the SIR model for the various parameter dependencies with respect to such as the outing restriction (lockdown) ratio and vaccination rate, we have finally noticed that the second term (isolation term) in the differential equation of the number of the infected is quite similar to the \"helium ash particle loss term\" in deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear fusion. Based on this analogy, we have found that isolation of the infected is not actively controlled in the SIR model. Then we introduce the isolation control time parameter q and have studied its effect on this pandemic. Required isolation time to terminate the COVID-19 can be estimated by this proposed method. To show this isolation control effect, we choose Tokyo for the model calculation because of high population density. We determine the reproduction number and the isolation ratio in the initial uncontrolled phase, and then the future number of the infected is estimated under various conditions. If the confirmed case can be isolated in 3~8 days by widely performed testing, this pandemic could be suppressed without awaiting vaccination. If the mild outing restriction and vaccination are taken together, the isolation control time can be longer. We consider this isolation time control might be the only solution to overcome the pandemic when vaccine is not available.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Osamu Mitarai","author_inst":"Institute for Advanced Fusion & Physics Education"},{"author_name":"Nagato Yanagi","author_inst":"National Institute for Fusion Science"},{"author_name":"Gaurab Mukherjee","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Monica S McAndrews","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Elissa J Chesler","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Judith A Blake","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanduo Zheng","author_inst":"National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, 102206 Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Jianping Wu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Devin J.

The value of routinely testing staff treating cancer patients is not known. Methods: Patient-facing oncology department staff at work during the COVID-19 pandemic consented to have a nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 antigen test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and blood tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using a laboratory Luminex-based assay and a rapid point-of-care (POC) assay on 2 occasions 28 days apart in June and July 2020. Results 434 participants were recruited: nurses (58.3%), doctors (21.2%), radiographers (10.4%) and administrators (10.1%). 82% were female; median age 40-years (range 19-66). 26.3% reported prior symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1.4% tested PCR-positive prior to June 2020. All were PCR-negative at both study day 1 and 28. 18.4% were SARS-CoV-2 sero-positive on day 1 by Luminex, of whom 42.5% also tested positive by POC. 47.5% of Luminex sero-positives had antibodies to both nucleocapsid (N) and surface (S) antigens. Nurses (21.3%) and doctors (17.4%) had higher prevalence trends of Luminex sero-positivity compared with administrators (13.6%) and radiographers (8.9%) (p=0.2). 38% of sero-positive participants reported previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a 1.9-fold higher odds than sero-negative participants (p=0.01). 400 participants re-tested on day 28: 13.3% were Luminex sero-positive of whom 92.5% were previously positive and 7.5% newly positive. Nurses (16.5%) had the highest seroprevalence trend amongst staff groups (p=0.07). 32.5% of day 1 sero-positives became sero-negative by day 28: the majority being previously reactive to the N-antigen only (p<0.0001). Conclusion The high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG sero-positivity in oncology nurses, and the high decline of positivity over 4 weeks supports regular antigen and antibody testing in this staff group for SARS-CoV-2 as part of routine patient care prior to availability of a vaccine.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David M Favara","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Karen McAdam","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Peterborough City Hospital, North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough"},{"author_name":"Anthony Cooke","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Laboratories, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Bordessa-Kelly","author_inst":"School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Ieva Budriunaite","author_inst":"Tissue Typing Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Sophie Bossingham","author_inst":"Tissue Typing Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Sally Houghton","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Rainer Doffinger","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Nicola Ainsworth","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Kings Lynn NHS Foundation Trust, Kings Lynn, UK"},{"author_name":"Pippa Corrie","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Yimin Tong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20190256","rel_title":"Commercial COVID-19 serial seroconversion panel for validation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays","rel_date":"2020-09-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190256","rel_abs":"Background: Seroconversion panels (SCP) are an important tool for investigating antibody responses and developing serological assays.

Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective study of all SARS-CoV-2 positive, hospitalized patients from 3\/26\/2020 to 8\/5\/2020 who had SARS CoV-2 Ct data within 48 hours of admission (n=1044). Only patients with complete survival data discharged (n=774) or died in hospital (n=270), were included in our analysis. Laboratory, demographic, and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to examine the relationship of patient mortality with Ct values while adjusting for established risk factors. Ct values were analyzed both as continuous variables and subdivided into quartiles to better illustrate their relationship with outcomes, and other covariates. Cumulative incidence curves were created to assess whether there was a survival difference in the setting of the competing risks of death versus patient discharge. In this cohort the mean Ct at admission was higher for survivors (28.6, SD=5.8) compared to non-survivors (24.8, SD=6.0, P<0.001). Patients with a lower Ct value on admission were found to have a higher odds ratio (0.91, CI 0.89-0.94, p<0.001) of in hospital mortality after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and history of hypertension and diabetes. Patients with Ct values in 3rd Quartile (Ct 27.4-32.8) and 4th Quartile (Ct >32.9) have a lower odds of in-hospital death (P<0.001) in comparison to the 1st Quartile. On comparing between Ct quartiles, the mortality, BMI and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were significantly different (p<0.05) between the groups. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and discharge was found to differ between Ct quartiles (Grays Test P<0.001 for both.) Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 Ct at admission was found to be an independent predictor of in patient mortality. However, further study is needed on how to best clinically utilize such information given the result variation due to specimen quality, phase of disease, and the limited discriminative ability of the test.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jui Choudhuri","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Carter","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Randin Nelson","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Karin Skalina","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marika Osterbur-Badhey","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Johnson","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Doctor Y Goldstein","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Monika Paroder","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Szymanski","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pippa Corrie","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Yimin Tong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.19.20196915","rel_title":"The Effects of Indias COVID-19 Lockdown on Critical Non-COVID Health Care and Outcomes","rel_date":"2020-09-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.19.20196915","rel_abs":"Indias COVID-19 lockdown is widely believed to have disrupted critical health services, but its effect on non-COVID health outcomes is largely unknown.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of postgraduate dental learners and instructors about the transition to distance learning, including the changes to the learning and teaching and its efficaciousness. A mixed-methods approach to research was utilized. All the instructors and postgraduate learners were invited to participate in the online survey. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential analyses on SPSS for Windows version 25.0, and for the responses to the open-ended questions, multi-staged Thematic Analysis was utilized. Both groups of stakeholders: learners and instructors, were quite satisfied with the rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19. Instructors were significantly more satisfied than the learners. The stakeholders adapted well to the change. The perception of the stakeholders regarding the case-based scenarios significantly influenced their level of satisfaction. As perceived by the stakeholders, the transition to distance learning entailed advantages and challenges.

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to disable various features of host immunity and cellular defense. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) is known to inhibit host protein translation and could be a target for antiviral therapy against COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents this translational blockage for the production of its own proteins is an open question. Here, we report a bipartite mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 which operates by: (1) hijacking the host ribosome via direct interaction of its C-terminal domain (CT) with the 40S ribosomal subunit and (2) specifically lifting this inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 via a direct interaction of its N-terminal domain (NT) with the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation, the 5 UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT, suggesting that the Nsp1-NT-UTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction. Indeed, lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR to escape the translational inhibition, supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5 UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1. Thus, our data provide a comprehensive view on how Nsp1 switches infected cells from host mRNA translation to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA translation, and that Nsp1 and 5 UTR may be targeted for anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ming Shi Sr.","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Longfei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Pietro Fontana","author_inst":"Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Setu Vora","author_inst":"Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School,"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Min Fu","author_inst":"Department of Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Judy Lieberman","author_inst":"Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hao Wu","author_inst":"Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"James Szymanski","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pippa Corrie","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Yimin Tong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.18.304493","rel_title":"An immunodominance hierarchy exists in CD8+ T cell responses to HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes identified from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_date":"2020-09-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.18.304493","rel_abs":"COVID-19 vaccines are being rapidly developed and human trials are underway. Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities. However, non-neutralizing antibodies are at risk of causing antibody-dependent enhancement. Further, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is very short. Therefore, in addition to antibody-induced vaccines, novel vaccines on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered in the vaccine development. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were firstly predicted as epitope candidates on bioinformatics. Fifty-four in 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were CTL epitopes because of the induction of IFN-{gamma}-producing CD8+ T cells. In the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10 peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides.

In order to exploit this element as a potential therapeutic target, we have designed antisense \"gapmer\" oligonucleotides that efficiently base-pair to the s2m region. These oligonucleotides, composed of locked nucleic acids (LNA) flanking a central DNA core, successfully remodel the s2m structure and induce sequence-specific RNA cleavage by RNase H in vitro. Gapmers are also effective in human cells as they reduce the fluorescence signal in GFP reporter assays and cause a dose-dependent reduction in replication in a model replicon system based on a human astrovirus.

The spike protein mediates both binding to host cells and membrane fusion and is also so far the only known viral target of neutralizing antibodies. Coronavirus spike proteins are large trimers that are relatively instable, a feature that might be enhanced by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Exchange of K986 and V987 to prolines has been shown to stabilize the trimers of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus spikes. Here, we test multiple versions of a soluble spike protein for their immunogenicity and protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model that transiently expresses human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 via adenovirus transduction. Variants tested include spike protein with a deleted polybasic cleavage site, the proline mutations, a combination thereof, as well as the wild type protein. While all versions of the protein were able to induce neutralizing antibodies, only the antigen with both a deleted cleavage site and the PP mutations completely protected from challenge in this mouse model.\n\nImportanceA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. A better understanding of antigen design and attributes that vaccine candidates need to have to induce protective immunity is of high importance. The data presented here validates the choice of antigens that contain the PP mutation and suggests that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site could lead to a further optimized design.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shirin Strohmeier","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Raveen Rathnasinghe","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael Schotsaert","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lynda Coughlan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garc\u00eda-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Felix Randow","author_inst":"MRC LMB"},{"author_name":"Helena J Maier","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"William Scott","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Yiliang Ding","author_inst":"John Innes Centre"},{"author_name":"Andrew Firth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kotryna Bloznelyte","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben Luisi","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20193987","rel_title":"Death associated with coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in individuals with severe mental disorders in Sweden during the early months of the outbreak - a exploratory cross-sectional analysis of a population-based register study","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20193987","rel_abs":"Background: Individuals with severe mental disorder (SMD) have a higher risk of somatic comorbidity and mortality than the rest of the population.

Methods: Exploratory analysis with a cross-sectional design in the framework of a population-based register study covering the entire Swedish population. The Swedish Board for Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) provided anonymised tabulated summary data for further analysis. We compared numbers of COVID-19 associated death in individuals with SMD (cases) and without SMD (controls). We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for the whole sample and by age group and four potential risk factors, namely diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease. Results: The sample comprised of 7,923,859 individuals, 103,999 with SMD and 7,819,860 controls. There were 130 (0.1%) COVID-19 associated deaths in the SMD group and 4945 (0.06%) in the control group, corresponding to an OR of 1.98 (CI 1.66-2.35; p < 0.001). The odds were fourfold in the age group between 60 and 79 years. Cardiovascular diseases increased the odds by 50%. Individuals with SMD without any of the risk factors under study had three-folds odds of COVID-19 associated death.

Design Cost-effectiveness analysis. Participants We used societal data and COVID-19 mortality rates from the public domain. Interventions The intervention was a strict lockdown strategy that has been followed by Denmark. Reference strategy was flexible social distancing policy as was applied by Sweden. We derived mortality rates from COVID-19 national statistics, assumed the expected life years lost from each COVID-19 death to be 11 years and calculated lost life years until 31st August 2020. Expected economic costs were derived from gross domestic productivity (GDP) statistics from each country's official statistics bureau and forecasted GDP. The incremental financial costs of the strict lockdown were calculated by comparing Sweden with Denmark using externally available market information. Calculations were projected per one million inhabitants. In sensitivity analyses we varied the total cost of the lockdown (range -50% to +100%). Main outcome measure Financial costs per life years saved. Results In Sweden, the number of people who died with COVID-19 was 577 per million inhabitants, resulting in an estimated 6,350 life years lost per million inhabitants. In Denmark, where a strict lockdown strategy was installed for months, the number of people dying with COVID-19 was on average 111 per million, resulting in an estimated 1,216 life years per million inhabitants lost. The incremental costs of strict lockdown to save one life year was US$ 137,285, and higher in most of the sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Comparisons of public health interventions for COVID-19 should take into account life years saved and not only lost lives. Strict lockdown costs more than US$ 130,000 per life year saved. As our all our assumptions were in favour of strict lockdown, a flexible social distancing policy in response to COVID19 is defendable.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ben W.

However, it is unclear whether these models work for a controlled community like Municipal Corporation or not. With measures now being employed at Municipal levels in India, it only fits to conduct particular research to examine how these models perform at lower jurisdictions.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard for clinical diagnosis but may produce false positives; thus, chest CT based diagnosis is considered more viable. However, accurate screening is challenging due to difficulty in annotation efforts of infected areas, curation of large datasets, and the slight discrepancies between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia. In this study, we propose an attention-based end-to-end weakly supervised framework for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia based on multiple instance learning (MIL). We further incorporate unsupervised contrastive learning for improved accuracy with attention applied both in spatial and latent contexts, herein we propose Dual Attention Contrastive based MIL (DA-CMIL). DA-CMIL takes as input a several patient CT slices (considered as a bag of instances) and outputs a single label. Attention based pooling is applied to implicitly select key slices in latent space, and spatial attention learns slice spatial context for interpretable diagnosis. A contrastive loss is applied at the instance level to encode similarity in features from the same patient against pooled patient features. Empirical results show our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 98.6% and an AUC of 98.4%. Moreover, ablation studies show the benefit of contrastive learning with MIL.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip Chikontwe","author_inst":"DGIST"},{"author_name":"Miguel Luna","author_inst":"DGIST"},{"author_name":"Myeongkyun Kang","author_inst":"DGIST"},{"author_name":"Kyung Soo Hong","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Regional Center for Respiratory Diseases, Yeungnam University Medical Center, College of M"},{"author_name":"June Hong Ahn","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Regional Center for Respiratory Diseases, Yeungnam University Medical Center, College of M"},{"author_name":"Sang Hyun Park","author_inst":"DGIST"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Felix Randow","author_inst":"MRC LMB"},{"author_name":"Helena J Maier","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"William Scott","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Yiliang Ding","author_inst":"John Innes Centre"},{"author_name":"Andrew Firth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kotryna Bloznelyte","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben Luisi","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20194548","rel_title":"Non-stationary Spatio-Temporal Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in The U.S.","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20194548","rel_abs":"The fast transmission rate of COVID-19 worldwide has made this virus the most important challenge of year 2020. Many mitigation policies have been imposed by the governments at different regional levels (country, state, county, and city) to stop the spread of this virus. Quantifying the effect of such mitigation strategies on the transmission and recovery rates, and predicting the rate of new daily cases are two crucial tasks. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework which not only accounts for such policies but also utilizes the spatial and temporal information to characterize the pattern of COVID-19 progression. Specifically, a piecewise susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is developed while the dates at which the transmission\/recover rates change significantly are defined as \"break points\" in this model. A novel and data-driven algorithm is designed to locate the break points using ideas from fused lasso and thresholding. In order to enhance the forecasting power and to describe additional temporal dependence among the daily number of cases, this model is further coupled with spatial smoothing covariates and vector auto-regressive (VAR) model. The proposed model is applied to several U.S. states and counties, and the results confirm the effect of \"stay-at-home orders\" and some states' early \"re-openings\" by detecting break points close to such events. Further, the model performed satisfactorily short-term forecasts of the number of new daily cases at regional levels by utilizing the estimated spatio-temporal covariance structures. Finally, some theoretical results and empirical performance of the proposed methodology on synthetic data are reported which justify the good performance of the proposed method.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yue Bai","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Abolfazl Safikhani","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"George Michailidis","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Kyung Soo Hong","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Regional Center for Respiratory Diseases, Yeungnam University Medical Center, College of M"},{"author_name":"June Hong Ahn","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Regional Center for Respiratory Diseases, Yeungnam University Medical Center, College of M"},{"author_name":"Sang Hyun Park","author_inst":"DGIST"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Felix Randow","author_inst":"MRC LMB"},{"author_name":"Helena J Maier","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"William Scott","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Yiliang Ding","author_inst":"John Innes Centre"},{"author_name":"Andrew Firth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kotryna Bloznelyte","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben Luisi","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20194696","rel_title":"First detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the vicinity of COVID-19 isolation centre through wastewater surveillance in Bangladesh","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20194696","rel_abs":"In the course of a COVID-19 pandemic, 0.33 million people got infected in Bangladesh, we made the first and successful attempt to detect SARS-CoV-2 viruses' genetic material in the vicinity wastewaters of an isolation centre i.e. Shaheed Bhulu Stadium, situated at Noakhali. The idea was to understand the genetic loading variation, both temporal and distance-wise in the nearby wastewater drains when the number of infected COVID-19 patients is not varying much. Owing to the fact that isolation center, in general, always contained a constant number of 200 COVID-19 patients, the prime objective of the study was to check if several drains carrying RNA of coronavirus are actually getting diluted or accumulated along with the sewage network. Our finding suggested that while the temporal variation of the genetic load decreased in small drains over the span of 50 days, the main sewer exhibited accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Other interesting finding displays that probably distance of sampling location in meters is not likely to have a significant impact on gene detection concentration, although the quantity of the RNA extracted in the downstream of the drain was higher. These findings are of immense value from the perspective of wastewater surveillance of COVID-19, as they largely imply that we do not need to monitor every wastewater system, and probably major drains monitoring may illustrate the city health. Perhaps, we are reporting the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material along the sewer network i.e. from primary to tertiary drains. The study sought further data collection in this line to simulate conditions prevailed in the most of south Asian country and to shed further light on the temporal variation and decay\/accumulation processes of the genetic load of the SARS-COV-2.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Firoz Ahmed","author_inst":"Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali-3814, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

A massive pro-inflammatory response on infected individuals involving several cytokines seems to play a key role on disease. As a result, therapeutic efforts have focused on anti-inflammatory strategies to ameliorate the disease, in sight of a lack of a truly effective anti-viral agent. Pentoxifylline (PTX) has been proposed by multiple authors as a potential therapeutic ally, targeting a variety of mechanisms as it has been shown to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory and hemodynamic effects. Importantly, anti-inflammatory effects center on down-regulation of cytokines such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor. In pre-pandemic studies, PTX has demonstrated to change the clinical course of inflammatory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Researchers agree it is pertinent to experimentally evaluate the effect this drug has on COVID-19 patients. The objective of this review is to summarize all the proposed mechanisms by which PTX may aid in the treatment of COVID-19, as well as prevent its deadly complications. Our interpretation of the literature is that the benefits PTX may bring to a patient with COVID-19 outweigh the risks this drug might pose on them. As a result, there is consensus regarding the evaluation of PTX in further experimental studies to better characterize its effects on COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Ramonfaur","author_inst":"School of postgraduate education, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Carlos A.

Pre-existing T cell memory has been hypothesized as a protective mechanism but conclusive evidence is lacking. Here we demonstrate that all unexposed individuals harbor SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells with marginal cross-reactivity to common cold corona and other unrelated viruses. They display low functional avidity and broad protein target specificities and their frequencies correlate with the overall size of the CD4+ memory compartment reflecting the immunological age of an individual. COVID-19 patients have strongly increased SARS-CoV-2-specific inflammatory T cell responses that are correlated with severity. Strikingly however, patients with severe COVID-19 displayed lower TCR functional avidity and less clonal expansion. Our data suggest that a low avidity pre-existing T cell memory negatively impacts on the T cell response quality against neoantigens such as SARS-CoV-2, which may predispose to develop inappropriate immune reactions especially in the elderly. We propose the immunological age as an independent risk factor to develop severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Petra Bacher","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel & UKSH Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Elisa Rosati","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniela Esser","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Rios Martini","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Carina Saggau","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel & UKSH Schleswig-Holstein, 11 Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Schiminsky","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel & UKSH Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Justina Dargvainiene","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ina Schr&oumlder","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Imke Wieters","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fabian Eberhardt","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Holger Neb","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."},{"author_name":"Yascha Khodamoradi","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Sonntagbauer","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."},{"author_name":"Maria JGT Vehreschild","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claudio Conrad","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of Preetz, Preetz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Tran","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20186494","rel_title":"Efficacy of commercial mouth-rinses on SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva: Randomized Control Trial in Singapore","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20186494","rel_abs":"The presence of high SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) titres in saliva may result in transmission of the virus and increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. This is particularly important as significant amounts of aerosols are generated during dental procedures, posing risk to dental care personnel and patients. Thus, reducing the titres of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of infected patients could be one of the key approaches to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during dental procedures. In this randomised control trial, the efficacy of three commercial mouth-rinse viz. povidone-iodine (PI), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), in reducing the salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 positive patients were compared with water. A total of 36 COVID-19 positive patients were recruited, of which 16 patients were randomly assigned to four groups: PI group (n=4), CHX group (n=6), CPC group (n=4) and water as control group (n=2). Saliva samples were collected from all patients at baseline and at 5 min, 3 h and 6 h post-application of mouth-rinses\/water. The samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR analysis. The fold change of Ct values were significantly increased in CPC group at 5 minutes and 6 h time points (p<0.05), while it showed significant increase at 6 h timepoint for PI group (p<0.01). Considering Ct values as an indirect method of arbitrarily quantifying the viral load, it can be postulated that CPC mouth-rinse can decrease the salivary SARS-CoV-2 levels within 5 minutes of use, compared to water rinsing. The effect of decreasing salivary load with CPC and PI mouth-rinsing was observed to be sustained at 6 h time point. Within the limitation of the current study, it can be concluded that use of CPC and PI formulated commercial mouth-rinses, with its sustained effect on reducing salivary SARS-CoV-2 level, may be useful as a pre-procedural rinse to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chaminda Jayampath Seneviratne","author_inst":"National Dental Research Institute Singapore (NDRIS), National Dental Centre Singapore, Oral Health ACP, Duke NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Preethi Balan","author_inst":"Singapore Oral Microbiomics Initiative, National Dental Research Institute Singapore (NDRIS), National Dental Centre Singapore, Oral Health ACP, Duke NUS Medica"},{"author_name":"Karrie Ko Kwan Ki","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Nadeeka S.

It was unclear if the lockdown period was associated with differences in the case-mix of non-COVID acute medical admissions compared with the previous year. Methods: Retrospective data were collected for 1st to 30th April 2019 and 1st to 30th April 2020 from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest hospitals in the UK with over 2 million patient contacts per year. The latter time period was chosen to coincide with the peak of COVID-19 cases in the West Midlands. All patients admitted under acute medicine during these time periods were included. COVID-19 was confirmed by SARS-Cov-2 swab or a probable case of COVID-19 based on World Health Organization diagnostic parameters. Non-COVID patients were those with a negative SARS-Cov-2 swab and no suspicion of COVID-19. Data was sourced from the UHB in-house electronic health system (EHS). Results: The total number of acute medical admissions fell comparing April 2019 (n=2409) to April 2020 (n=1682). As a proportion of total admissions, those aged under 45 years decreased, while those aged 46 and over did not change. The number of admissions due to psychiatric conditions and overdoses was higher in April 2020 (p < 0.001). When viewed as a proportion of admissions, alcohol-related admissions (p = 0.004), psychiatric conditions and overdoses (p<0.001) increased in April 2020 than in April 2019. The proportion of patients who were in hospital due to falls also increased in April 2020 (p<0.001). In the same period, the absolute number and the proportion of admissions that were due to non-specific chest pain, to musculoskeletal complaints and patients who self-discharged prior to assessment decreased (p=0.02, p=0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively). There were no significant differences in non-COVID-related intensive care admissions or mortality between the same months in the two years. Conclusion: In this large, single-centre study, there was a change in hospitalised case-mix when comparing April 2019 with April 2020: an increase in conditions which potentially reflect social isolation (falls, drug and alcohol misuse and psychiatric illness) and a decrease in conditions which rarely require in-patient hospital treatment (musculoskeletal pain and non-cardiac chest pain) especially among younger adults. These results highlight two areas for further research; the impact of social isolation on health and whether younger adults could be offered alternative health services to avoid potentially unnecessary hospital assessment.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bridget Riley","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Mary Packer","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzy Gallier","author_inst":"PIONEER Hub, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Sapey","author_inst":"PIONEER Hub, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Catherine Atkin","author_inst":"PIONEER Hub, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Dorothy Ng Hui Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Indumathi Venkatachalam","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jay Lim Kheng Sit","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ling Moi Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Epidemiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lynette Oon","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Bee Tin Goh","author_inst":"Singapore Oral Microbiomics Initiative, National Dental Research Institute Singapore (NDRIS), National Dental Centre Singapore, Oral Health ACP, Duke NUS Medica"},{"author_name":"Jean Sim Xiang Ying","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Michael Sonntagbauer","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."},{"author_name":"Maria JGT Vehreschild","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claudio Conrad","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of Preetz, Preetz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Tran","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20194811","rel_title":"Disease control as an optimization problem","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20194811","rel_abs":"Traditionally, expert epidemiologists devise policies for disease control through a mixture of intuition and brute force. Namely, they use their know-how to narrow down the set of logically conceivable policies to a small family described by a few parameters, following which they conduct a grid search to identify the optimal policy within the set. This scheme is not scalable, in the sense that, when used to optimize over policies which depend on many parameters, it would likely fail to output an optimal disease policy in time for its implementation. In this article, we use techniques from convex optimization theory and machine learning to conduct optimizations over disease policies described by hundreds of parameters. We illustrate our approach by minimizing the total time required to eradicate COVID-19 within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model proposed by Kissler et al. (March, 2020). We observe that optimal policies are typically very complex, and thus unlikely to be discovered by a human agent.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel Navascues","author_inst":"Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yelena Guryanova","author_inst":"Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Costantino Budroni","author_inst":"Faculty of Physics, University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Sapey","author_inst":"PIONEER Hub, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Catherine Atkin","author_inst":"PIONEER Hub, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Dorothy Ng Hui Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Indumathi Venkatachalam","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jay Lim Kheng Sit","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ling Moi Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Epidemiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lynette Oon","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Bee Tin Goh","author_inst":"Singapore Oral Microbiomics Initiative, National Dental Research Institute Singapore (NDRIS), National Dental Centre Singapore, Oral Health ACP, Duke NUS Medica"},{"author_name":"Jean Sim Xiang Ying","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Michael Sonntagbauer","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."},{"author_name":"Maria JGT Vehreschild","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claudio Conrad","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of Preetz, Preetz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Tran","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20192039","rel_title":"What Does the Public Want to Know About The COVID-19 Pandemic?

In this study, we analysed the content, type and quality of Q&As in Quora regarding this pandemic, and compared the information with that on World Health Organization (WHO) website. Methods We conducted a systematic search to include 964 questions in Quora. The tone of the question was categorized as either positive (questions with a primary intent to obtain information), negative (questions which represent panic or are related to misconception\/false information) or ambivalent. The two most helpful answers of each question were graded for accuracy, authority, popularity, readability, and relevancy. Results 462 (48%) questions were classified as positive, while 391 (41%) were negative. Number of views were higher for negative questions (11421 vs 7300, p=0.004). Majority of the questions were on social impact (N=217, 23%), followed by politics (N=122, 13%) and disease management (N=96, 10%). Positive questions had more accurate, but less popular answers (p<0.05). Information related to 229 (28%) questions were present on WHO website, while partial information was present for 103 (11%) questions. Discussion Higher views with negative questions suggest that false and panic promoting information is more likely to get public attention. A substantial amount of questions was related to the present and future effects of COVID-19 on social and personal lives of the users which were not readily available on official health websites.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaiben George","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gautam","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vartika Kesarwani","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health"},{"author_name":"PonAravindhan A Sugumar","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Malhotra","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dorothy Ng Hui Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Indumathi Venkatachalam","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jay Lim Kheng Sit","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ling Moi Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Epidemiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lynette Oon","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Bee Tin Goh","author_inst":"Singapore Oral Microbiomics Initiative, National Dental Research Institute Singapore (NDRIS), National Dental Centre Singapore, Oral Health ACP, Duke NUS Medica"},{"author_name":"Jean Sim Xiang Ying","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Michael Sonntagbauer","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."},{"author_name":"Maria JGT Vehreschild","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claudio Conrad","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of Preetz, Preetz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Tran","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20195081","rel_title":"An Application of Logistic Formula to Deaths by COVID-19 in Japan","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20195081","rel_abs":"A logistic formula in biology is applied to analyze deaths by COVID-19 for both of the first and the second waves in Japan.
