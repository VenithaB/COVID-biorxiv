While Remdesivir has recently received FDA emergency use authorization for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, convalescent plasma (CP) with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from recovered donors remains a promising and widely accessible method to mitigate severe disease symptoms. Here, we describe the development and validation of a cell-free neutralization PCR assay using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 and human ACE2 receptor-DNA conjugates. By comparing with samples collected prior to the outbreak, we confirmed that NAbs were specifically detected in COVID-19 cases. Using our unique assay, the NAb signals are detectable as early as 10 days after onset of symptoms and continue to rise, plateauing after 18 days. Notably, we showed that the use of licensed pathogen reduction technology to inactivate potentially contaminating infectious pathogens in CP did not alter NAb signals, paving a path to safely administer effective CP therapies. The described neutralization PCR assay can serve as a qualification tool to easily identify suitable CP donors of a potentially lifesaving therapy. In addition, this assay tool is readily deployable in standard laboratories with biosafety level 2 capability, and can yield results within 2-3 hr. This advancement can facilitate research on factors driving diverse COVID-19 disease manifestations, and to evaluate the impact of various CP processing protocols on CP therapeutic efficacy.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth Danh","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Donna Grace Karp","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Peter V Robinson","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"David Seftel","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Mars Stone","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Graham Simmons","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Anil Bagri","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Martin Schreibman","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Buser","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Holbro","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Laurence M Corash","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Carl Hanson","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cheng-ting Tsai","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20086025","rel_title":"Age differences in clinical features and outcomes in patients with COVID-19, Jiangsu, China: a retrospective, multi-center cohort study","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20086025","rel_abs":"Objectives To determine the age-specific clinical presentations and incidence of adverse outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in Jiangsu, China. Design and setting This is a retrospective, multi-center cohort study performed at twenty-four hospitals in Jiangsu, China. Participants From January 10 to March 15, 2020, 625 patients with COVID-19 were involved. Results Of the 625 patients (median age, 46 years; 329 [52.6%] males), 37 (5.9%) were children (18 years or less), 261 (40%) young adults (19-44 years), 248 (39.7%) middle-aged adults (45-64 years), and 79 (12.6%) elderly (65 years or more). The incidence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes comorbidities increased with age (trend test, P < .0001, P = 0.0003, P < .0001, and P < .0001 respectively). Fever, cough, and shortness of breath occurred more commonly among older patients, especially the elderly, compared to children (Chi-square test, P = 0.0008, 0.0146, and 0.0282, respectively). The quadrant score and pulmonary opacity score increased with age (trend test, both P < .0001). Older patients had significantly more abnormal values in many laboratory parameters than younger patients. Elderly patients contributed the highest proportion of severe or critically-ill cases (33.0%, Chi-square test P < 0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) (35.4%, Chi-square test P < 0.001), and respiratory failure (31.6%, Chi-square test P = 0.0266), and longest hospital stay (21 days, ANOVA-test P < 0.001). Conclusions Elderly ([&ge;]65) patients with COVID-19 had the highest risk of severe or critical illness, intensive care use, respiratory failure, and the longest hospital stay, which may be due partly to that they had higher incidence of comorbidities and poor immune responses to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huanyuan Luo","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM)"},{"author_name":"Songqiao Liu","author_inst":"Southeast University Zhongda Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuancheng Wang","author_inst":"Southeast University Zhongda Hospital"},{"author_name":"Penelope A.

When these measures were in full effect, new cases of infection would be primarily induced by community spread, such as the human interaction within and between neighboring cities and towns, which is generally known as the meso-scale. Existing studies of COVID-19 using mathematical models are unable to accommodate the need for meso-scale modeling, because of the unavailability of COVID-19 data at this scale and the different timings of local intervention policies. In this respect, we propose a meso-scale mathematical model of COVID-19 using town-level infection data in the state of Connecticut. We consider the spatial interaction in terms of the inter-town travel in the model. Based on the developed model, we evaluated how different strengths of social distancing policy enforcement may impact future epidemic curves based on two evaluative metrics: compliance and containment. The developed model and the simulation results will establish the foundation for community-level assessment and better preparation for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Geography, University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Aiyin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Modeling Collaboration and Innovation, University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Adam Gallaher","author_inst":"Department of Geography, University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Zhu","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Nico Nagelkerke","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, St. Micheal's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"H.

Some propose global testing to effectively contain Covid-19. Current tests for Covid-19 are administered individually. These tests for Covid-19 are expensive and are limited due to the lack of resources and time. We propose a simple and efficient group testing method for Covid-19. We propose a group testing method where test subjects are grouped and tested. Depending on the result of the group test, subsequent sub groups are formed and tested recursively based on a quartery search algorithm. We designed and built an evaluation model that simulates test subject population, infected test subjects according to available Covid-19 statistics, and the group testing processes in SCALE19. We considered several population models including USA and the world. Our results show that we can significantly reduce the required number of tests up to 89% without sacrificing the accuracy of the individual test of the entire population. For USA, up to 280 million tests can be reduced from the total US population of 331 million and it would be equivalent saving of $28 billion assuming a cost of $100 per test. For the world, 6.96 billion tests can be reduced from the total population of 7.8 billion and it would be equivalent to saving $696 billion. We propose SCALE19 can significantly reduce the total required number of tests compared to individual tests of the entire population. We believe SCALE19 is efficient and simple to be deployed in containment of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremie S Kim","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Justine S Kim","author_inst":"UPMC"},{"author_name":"Hyong Kim","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon Unviersity"},{"author_name":"Adam Gallaher","author_inst":"Department of Geography, University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Zhu","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Nico Nagelkerke","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, St. Micheal's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"H.

We herein report the first set of data of our prospective cohort study of 90 hospitalized cases. Serological surveys were thoroughly performed over 2 month period by assessing IgG and IgM responses by immunofluorescence, immunoblot, Western blot and conventional ELISA using clinical RUN isolates of SARS-CoV-2 immobilized on 96 well plates. While the IgM and, unexpectedly, the IgG responses were readily detected early during the course of the disease (5-7 days post-first symptoms), our results (n=3-5 and over the full dilution set of the plasma 1\/200 to 1\/12800) demonstrated a significant decrease (over 2.5-fold) of IgG levels in severe (ICU) hospitalized patients (exemplified in patient 1) by WB and ELISA. In contrast, mild non-ICU patients had a steady and yet robust rise in their specific IgG levels against the virus. Interestingly, both responses (IgM and IgG) were initially against the nucleocapsid (50kDa band on the WB) and spreading to other major viral protein S and domains (S1 and S2. In conclusion, serological testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of patients with negative RT-PCR results and for the identification of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, medical care and protections should be maintained particularly for recovered patients (severe cases) who may remain at risk of relapsing or reinfection. Experiments to ascertain T cell responses but although their kinetics overtime are now highly warranted. All in all, these studies will help to delineate the best routes for vaccination.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony Dobi","author_inst":"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Etienne Frumence","author_inst":"Laboratoire immunologie Clinique et experimentale de la ZOI (LICE-OI), Pole de Biologie, CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Mahary LALARIZO RAKOTO","author_inst":"Laboratoire immunologie Clinique et experimentale de la ZOI (LICE-OI), Pole de Biologie, CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Gregorie Lebeau","author_inst":"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Damien Vagner","author_inst":"UMR PIMIT Processus infectieux en milieu Insulaire tropical CNRS 9192, INSERM1187, IRD 249, Universite de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Anne-Laure SANDENON SETEYEN","author_inst":"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Claude Giry","author_inst":"CNR associe arbovirus, Laboratoire de Microbiologie, Pole de Biologie, CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Axelle Septembre-Malaterre","author_inst":"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Marie-Christine Jaffar-Bandjee","author_inst":"CNR associe arbovirus, Laboratoire de Microbiologie, Pole de Biologie, CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Loic Raffray","author_inst":"Service de Medecine Interne, CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Philippe Gasque","author_inst":"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Laurence M Corash","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Carl Hanson","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cheng-ting Tsai","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110387","rel_title":"Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110387","rel_abs":"A novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerged from the Wuhan city of China at the end of 2019, causing devastating public health and socio-economic burden around the world. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antiviral for use in humans, control and mitigation efforts against COVID-19 are focussed on using non-pharmaceutical interventions (aimed at reducing community transmission of COVID-19), such as social (physical)-distancing, community lockdown, use of face masks in public, isolation and contact tracing of confirmed cases and quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to COVID-19. We developed a mathematical model for understanding the transmission dynamics and control of COVID-19 in Nigeria, one of the main epicenters of COVID-19 in Africa. Rigorous analysis of the Kermack-McKendrick-type compartmental epidemic model we developed, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, reveal that the model has a continuum of disease-free equilibria which is locally-asymptotically stable whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, called the it control reproduction (denoted by Rc), is less than unity. The epidemiological implication of this result is that the pandemic can be effectively controlled (or even eliminated) in Nigeria if the control strategies implemented can bring (and maintain) the epidemiological threshold (Rc) to a value less than unity. The model, which was parametrized using COVID-19 data published by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), was used to assess the community-wide impact of various control and mitigation strategies in the entire Nigerian nation, as well as in two states (Kano and Lagos) within the Nigerian federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT Abuja). It was shown that, for the worst-case scenario where social-distancing, lockdown and other community transmission reduction measures are not implemented, Nigeria would have recorded a devastatingly high COVID-19 mortality by April 2021 (in hundreds of thousands). It was, however, shown that COVID-19 can be effectively controlled using social-distancing measures provided its effectiveness level is at least moderate. Although the use of face masks in the public can significantly reduce COVID-19 in Nigeria, its use as a sole intervention strategy may fail to lead to the realistic elimination of the disease (since such elimination requires unrealistic high compliance in face mask usage in the public, in the range of 80% to 95%). COVID-19 elimination is feasible in both the entire Nigerian nation, and the States of Kano and Lagos, as well as the FCT, if the public face masks use strategy (using mask with moderate efficacy, and moderate compliance in its usage) is complemented with a social-distancing strategy. The lockdown measures implemented in Nigeria on March 30, 2020 need to be maintained for at least three to four months to lead to the effective containment of COVID-19 outbreaks in the country. Relaxing, or fully lifting, the lockdown measures sooner, in an effort to re-open the economy or the country, may trigger a deadly second wave of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enahoro A.

Method: A systematic search of the European Clinical trial registry, the U.S. National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) created by the World Health Organization (WHO) was conducted on May 10th, 2020 to identify the study details of the SOLIDARITY and DisCoVeRy trials. A supplementary search of PubMed, the websites of the WHO and French authorities, and Google search engine was conducted. A critical review was performed on the findings. Results: The DisCoVeRy trial design was detailed consistently in both the European and the US clinical rial registries. SOLIDARITY was registered on ICTRP, with country-specific information reported on country-level registry platforms. The design of DisCoVeRy trial appears to be ideal from the methodological perspective. Both trials appear difficult to implement, impractical, and disconnected from the pandemic reality. This is consistent with the apparent failure of the trials to deliver conclusions before the end of the pandemic.

We hypothesized that fewer patients administered DMB would require oxygen therapy and\/or intensive care support than those who did not. Methodology: Cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 50 and above in a tertiary academic hospital who received DMB compared to a recent cohort who did not. Patients were administered oral vitamin D3 1000 IU OD, magnesium 150mg OD and vitamin B12 500mcg OD (DMB) upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy.

The approach allowed the maximum risk for an exposed healthy subject to be evaluated or, starting from an acceptable risk, the maximum exposure time. We applied the proposed approach to four distinct scenarios for a prospective assessment, highlighting that, in order to guarantee an acceptable individual risk of 10-3 for exposed subjects in naturally ventilated indoor environments, the exposure time should be shorter than 20 min. The proposed approach was used for retrospective assessment of documented outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou (China) and at a choir rehearsal in Mount Vernon (USA), showing that, in both cases, the high attack rate values can be justified only assuming the airborne transmission as the main route of contagion. Moreover, we shown that such outbreaks are not caused by the rare presence of a superspreader, but can be likely explained by the co-existence of conditions, including emission and exposure parameters, leading to a highly probable event, which can be defined as a superspreading event.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giorgio Buonanno","author_inst":"University of Cassino and Southern Lazio"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Luca Stabile","author_inst":"University of Cassino and Southern Lazio"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, HUST"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST"},{"author_name":"Bettina Tiemer","author_inst":"Laboraerztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bobrowski","author_inst":"Laboraerztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Timothy Hutchings","author_inst":"Municipal Statistics Department, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Mischnik","author_inst":"Health Protection Authority, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chandramouli Nagarajan","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rehena Sultana","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jenny Guek Hong Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heng Joo Ng","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-ting Tsai","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20119057","rel_title":"Potential impact of Covid-19 response measures on invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20119057","rel_abs":"In January 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) removed one of the two infant doses of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), leaving a single priming dose at 3 months and a 12 month booster. We modelled the potential impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) of a drop in PCV13 coverage associated with the restrictions on non-essential health care visits introduced to combat COVID-19 in the UK on 23 March 2020. Using a previously published model of pneumococcal transmission in England and Wales we simulated the impact of reducing PCV13 coverage by 50% for 3 months from 23 March without subsequent catch-up vaccination. To implement social distancing, we reduced mixing between and within age-groups by either 10% or 50%. In a sensitivity analysis we explored the effect of complete cessation of PCV13 vaccination during the lockdown and of extending its duration to 6 months. Annual numbers of IPD cases predicted by the model under different vaccination and lockdown scenarios with uncertainty intervals (UI) generated from the minimum and maximum values of the model predictions using 500 parameter sets with values within a pre-specified range of the maximum likelihood set. The model predicted that any increase in IPD cases from a reduction in PCV13 coverage would be more than offset by a reduction in pneumococcal transmission due to social distancing, with a net reduction in cumulative IPD cases (UI -1,479, -1,061, all ages) over the next five years. Similar results were obtained in the sensitivity analysis, though with a greater reduction with a 6 month lockdown. COVID-19 social distancing measures are predicted to have had a profound effect on pneumococcal transmission resulting in a reduction in pneumococcal carriage prevalence and IPD incidence over the first two years after the lockdown. Carriage studies will be informative in confirming the predicted impact of the social distancing measures after they have been lifted.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yoon Hong Choi","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Miller","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luca Stabile","author_inst":"University of Cassino and Southern Lazio"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, HUST"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST"},{"author_name":"Bettina Tiemer","author_inst":"Laboraerztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bobrowski","author_inst":"Laboraerztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Timothy Hutchings","author_inst":"Municipal Statistics Department, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Mischnik","author_inst":"Health Protection Authority, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chandramouli Nagarajan","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rehena Sultana","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jenny Guek Hong Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heng Joo Ng","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-ting Tsai","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20108597","rel_title":"POOLING FOR SARS-CoV-2 CONTROL IN CARE INSTITUTIONS","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20108597","rel_abs":"Workers and residents in Care Homes are considered at special risk for the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to the infectivity and high mortality rate in the case of residents, compared to other containment areas.

Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection at Care Houses was uneven. As the virus circulation global rate was low in our area, the number of people at risk of acquiring the infection continues to be very high. In this work, we have successfully demonstrated that pooling of different groups of samples at low prevalence clusters, can be done with a small average delay on quantification cycle (Cq) values. A new surveillance system with guaranteed protection is required for small clusters, previously covered with individual testing. Our proposal for Care Houses, once prevalence zero is achieved, would include successive rounds of testing using a pooling solution for transmission control preserving testing resources. Scale-up of this method may be of utility to confront larger clusters to avoid the viral circulation and keeping them operative.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge J Cabrera","author_inst":"Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Vigo (CHUVI), Sergas.

Yet, secondary bacterial infection is uncommon. However, as epithelium are injured and barrier function is lost, bacterial products entering the circulation might contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Methods: We studied 19 adults, severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection, who were admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 13th March and 17th April 2020. Blood samples on day 1, 3, and 7 of enrollment were analyzed for endotoxin activity assay (EAA), Beta-D-Glucan (BG), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the circulating bacteriome. Findings: Of the 19 patients, 14 were in intensive care and 10 patients received mechanical ventilation. We found 8 patients with high EAA ([&ge;] 0.6) and about half of the patients had high serum BG levels which tended to be higher in later in the illness. Although only 1 patient had a positive blood culture, 18 of 19 patients were positive for 16S rRNA gene amplification. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The diversity of bacterial genera was decreased overtime. Interpretation: Bacterial DNA and toxins were discovered in virtual all severely ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients. This raises a previously unrecognized concern for significant contribution of bacterial products in the pathogenesis of this disease.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Phatadon

This analysis aimed to determine a 48 hours prediction of moderate to severe respiratory failure, as assessed with PaO2\/FiO2 < 150 mmHg, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods This was an observational study that comprised all consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the University Hospital of Modena, Italy from 21 February to 6 April 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed with PCR positive nasopharyngeal swabs while the presence of pneumonia was radiologically confirmed. Patients received standard of care according to national guidelines for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients' full medical history, demographic and epidemiological features, clinical data, complete blood count, coagulation, inflammatory and biochemical markers were routinely collected and aggregated in a clinically-oriented logical framework in order to build different datasets. The dataset was used to train a learning framework relying on Microsoft LightGBM and leveraging a hybrid approach, where clinical expertise is applied alongside a data-driven analysis. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to quantify the positive or negative impact of each variable included in the model on the predicted outcome. The study outcome was the onset of moderate to severe respiratory failure defined as PaO2\/FiO2 ratio < 150 mmHg ([&ge;] 13.3 kPa) in at least one of two consecutive arterial blood gas analyses in the following 48 hours. Results A total of 198 patients contributed to generate 1068 valuable observations which allowed to build 3 prediction models based respectively on 31-variables signs and symptoms, 39-variables laboratory biomarkers and 91-variables as a composition of the two. A fourth boosted mixed model which included 20 variables was selected from the model 3, achieved the best predictive performance (AUC=0.84). Its clinical performance was applied in a narrative case report as an example. Conclusion This study developed a machine learning algorithm, with a 84% prediction accuracy, which is potentially able to assist clinicians in decision making process with therapeutic implications.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davide Ferrari","author_inst":"Department of Physical, Computer and Mathematical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia,

trends of the COVID-19 epidemic and effectiveness of government interventions in Nigeria: A data-driven analysis.","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20110098","rel_abs":"Background: Nigeria became the first sub Saharan African country to record a case of COVID-19 after an imported case from Italy was confirmed on February 27, 2020. Moving averages and the Epidemic Evaluation Indices (EEI) are two important but complementary methods useful in monitoring epidemic trends, they can also serve as a useful guide for policy makers and inform the timing of decisions on preventive measures. The objectives of this paper are to graphically depict the trends of new COVID-19 cases nationally and in two key States (Lagos and Kano) and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) using the moving averages and the EEI. In addition, we examined the effects of governments public health interventions on the spread of COVID-19 and appraise the progress made so far in addressing the challenges of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Methods: We used data on new cases of COVID-19 from public sources released by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) from the 27th February 2020, when the first case was recorded, to 11th May, 2020, one week after the lockdowns in Lagos and the FCT were lifted. We computed moving averages of various orders, the log transformations of the moving averages and then the EEIs of new COVID-19 cases for Nigeria as a whole, and then for two of the most affected states i.e. Lagos and Kano, as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Then, we plotted graphs to depict these indices and show the epidemic trends for COVID-19 in each scenario. Results: Nationally, the number of new cases of COVID-19 showed an initial gradual rise from the first reported case on the 27th February 2020. However, by the second week in April, these numbers began to show a relatively sharper increase and this trend has continued till date. Similar trends were observed in Lagos state and the FCT. The rate of growth of the logarithm-transformed moving average in the period leading to, and including the lockdowns reduced by a factor of 0.65. This suggests that the policies put in place by the government including the lockdown measures in Lagos and the FCT may have had a positive effect on the development of new cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Nationally and in Lagos, the EEIs of the COVID-19 cases started off on very high notes, however, the effects of the lockdown gradually became evident by the end of April and early May 2020, as the EEIs headed closer to 1.0. In all case scenarios, the EEIs are still above 1.0. Conclusions and recommendations: The number of new cases of COVID-19 has been on a steady rise since the first reported case. In Nigeria especially across the two states and the FCT, public health interventions including the lockdown measures appear to have played a role in reducing the rate of increase of new infections. The EEIs are still above 1.0, suggesting that despite the progress that appears to have been made, the epidemic is still evolving and Nigeria has not yet reached her peak for COVID-19 cases. We recommend that aggressive public health interventions and restrictions against mass gatherings should be sustained.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oluwakemi Ololade

mental health outcomes associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, including trauma-related symptoms although the effects on the Italian population who were subjected to unprecedented nationwide lockdown measure remains unknown. The Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS) is a brief instrument designed to assess a broad range of trauma-related symptoms with no available validation in the Italian population. Aims: This study aimed at examining the factor structure of the Italian version of the GPS in a general population sample exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic and at evaluating trauma-related symptoms in the Italian population in the context of specific COVID-19 related risk factors associated with the implementation of lockdown measures and social distancing. Methods: Cross-sectional web-based observational study, as part of a long-term monitoring programme of mental health outcomes in the general population. 18147 participants completed a self-report online questionnaire to collect key demographic data and to evaluate trauma-related symptoms using the GPS, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and PSS. Validation analyses included both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and correlation analyses. Results: Exploratory factor analyses supported both a two-factor and a three-factor model. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a one-factor solution that was used as a baseline comparison showed acceptable fit indices, the two-factor solution showed good fit indices, but the best fitting model was a three-factor solution, with Negative Affect (symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, irritability), core Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) (avoidance, re-experiencing, hyperarousal and insomnia) and Dissociative symptoms. GPS Risk factors as well as specific COVID-19 related stressful events, were associated with GPS total as well as the three factor scores. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a wide range of trauma-spectrum symptoms were reported by a large Italian sample during the COVID-19 pandemic. The GPS symptoms clustered best in three factors: Negative Affect symptoms, Core PTSS, and Dissociative symptoms. In particular high rates of core PTSS and negative affect symptoms were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and should be routinely assessed in clinical practice.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rodolfo Rossi","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Valentina Socci","author_inst":"University of

Methods We studied 4,510 UK Biobank participants tested for COVID-19 (positive, n=1,326). Multivariate logistic regression models including age, sex, and ethnicity were used to test whether addition of: 1)cardiometabolic factors (diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, prior myocardial infarction, smoking, BMI); 2)25(OH)-vitamin D; 3)poor diet; 4)Townsend deprivation score; 5)housing (home type, overcrowding); or 6)behavioural factors (sociability, risk taking) attenuated sex\/ethnicity associations with COVID-19 status. Results There was over-representation of men and non-White ethnicities in the COVID-19 positive group. Non-Whites had, on average, poorer cardiometabolic profile, lower 25(OH)-vitamin D, greater material deprivation, and were more likely to live in larger households and flats\/apartments. Male sex, non-White ethnicity, higher BMI, Townsend deprivation score, and household overcrowding were independently associated with significantly greater odds of COVID-19. The pattern of association was consistent for men and women; cardiometabolic, socio-demographic and behavioural factors did not attenuate sex\/ethnicity associations. Conclusions Sex and ethnicity differential pattern of COVID-19 is not adequately explained by variations in cardiometabolic factors, 25(OH)-vitamin D levels, or socio-economic factors. Investigation of alternative biological pathways and different genetic susceptibilities is warranted.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zahra Raisi-Estabragh","author_inst":"William

SARS-CoV-2 virus was originated in the city of Wuhan (China) in December 2019, the virus began to spread in other regions of China until it spread to the rest of the world. In this research, an analysis was made of environmental factors (tropospheric column of NO2, vertical airflow, percentage of solid waste disposed of in open dumps and percentage of the population without any mechanism of faeces disposal) and social factors (levels of monetary poverty, percentage of the number of hospitals per population and vulnerable population) that could directly and indirectly affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the regions of Peru. Remote sensing techniques, geographic information systems and an analysis under the multi-parametric statistical approach proposed by Saaty were used to determine which regions present greater susceptibility, vulnerability and risk of spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results show that the prevalence of high values of tropospheric NO2 and values close to 0 Pa\/s of the vertical airflow were directly related to the number of positive cases by COVID-19. In addition, it was found that 68% of the regions of Peru are at a \"high\" and \"very high\" risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus, and most of them are in northern and central Peru (Callao, Tumbes, Piura, Loreto, Lambayeque, Huancavelica, Amazonas, Cajamarca, Ucayali, Huanuco and among others), therefore, special care should be taken with the measures adopted after social isolation in order to avoid the resurgence and collapse of the of health systems. It concludes that public policies on air quality management, integrated solid waste management and sanitation services should be improved in order to reduce the risk of spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This research can be replicated on a longer scale, including more variables.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edwin N Badillo Rivera Sr.","author_inst":"National University of

March 31st, 2020, during the height of the pandemic, we have decontaminated thousands of 3M 1860 respirators with Ultraviolet C (UVC) for our frontline workers. There is no published peer-reviewed data regarding the dose required to effectively disinfect SARS-CoV-2 on N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Four different locations (facepiece and strap) on 5 different N95 FFR models (3M 1860, 8210, 8511, 9211; Moldex 1511) were inoculated with a 10 L drop of SARS-CoV-2 viral stock (8 x 107 TCID50\/mL). The outside-facing and wearer-facing surfaces of the respirators were each irradiated with a dose of 1.5 J\/cm2 UVC (254 nm). Viable SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by a median tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID50). UVC delivered using a dose of 1.5 J\/cm2, to each side, was an effective method of decontamination for the facepieces of 3M 1860 and Moldex 1511, and for the straps of 3M 8210 and the Moldex 1511. This dose is an appropriate decontamination method to facilitate reuse of respirators for healthcare personnel when applied to certain models\/materials. Increasing the dose may improve decontamination for the other models and straps; however, UVC radiation can degrade certain polymers in a dose dependent manner, and the effects may vary greatly between different models. Therefore, fit-testing of UVC decontaminated respirators must be performed each time a new model and\/or dose is introduced into the healthcare system.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David M.

The method is applied to the island of Gotland off the South East coast of Sweden. It is shown that the amount of mixing between the metropolitan and province groups and the fraction of metropolitan people being infectious upon arrival are most influential.

evolution of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence in the greater area of Zurich, Switzerland, a region that has been only mildly hit by the pandemic in spite of hosting an international airport hub and a highly mobile population. Seroprevalence studies in low-prevalence settings require large sample sizes and high-specificity methodologies. To address this particular challenge, we developed a Tripartite Automated Blood Immunoassay to assess the IgG response against three SARS-CoV-2 proteins on approximately 40'000 samples from university hospital patients and healthy blood donors. The seroprevalence increased in March 2020 (0.3%; CI95%: 0.1% - 0.5%) in the cohort of the hospital patients but rapidly plateaued in April at 1.1-1.3%, with a slight drop in June, then decreased in July to 0.3-0.7%. Seropositive samples were confirmed with Western Blotting and liquid-phase binding assays. Employing a dynamic transmission model that describes SARS-CoV-2 transmission and seroconversion in the general population of the Canton of Zurich, we estimated an infection fatality ratio of 0.6% (CI95%: 0.4%-0.8%). We conclude that a small proportion of the population in the greater area of Zurich has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, with an IFR that is similar to that of other European areas.

Once these countries passed the peak, the daily case count fell back, mirroring its initial climb in a symmetric way, just as the classic model predicts. However, in Italy and Spain, and now the UK and many other Western countries, the experience has been very different. The daily count has fallen back gradually from the peak but remained stubbornly high. The reason for the divergence from the classical model remain unclear. We take an empirical stance on this issue and develop a model that is based upon the statistical characteristics of the time series.

Materials and Methods This is a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing CTPA between 23rd March 2020 and 19th April 2020 in a tertiary centre. The presence of PTD, location and involved pulmonary lobes were documented. The pattern and extent of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities including the presence of fibrosis, lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion were evaluated by two experienced observers independently and consensus was achieved for the most disparate results. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using Kappa statistics. Student t-test, Chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare imaging features between PTD and non-PTD sub-groups. Results During the study period, 2157 patients were confirmed with COVID-19, 297\/2157 (13.8%) had CT imaging, 100\/2157 (4.6%) were CTPA studies, 93 studies were analysed, excluding sub-optimal studies. Overall incidence of PTD was 41\/93 (44%) with a third of patients showing segmental and subsegmental PTD (n=28\/93, 30%,). D-dimer was elevated in 90\/93 (96.8%) of cases. High Wells score did not differentiate between PE and non-PE groups (p=0.801). The inter-observer agreement was fair (Kappa=0.659) for parenchymal pattern and excellent (Kappa = 0.816) for severity. Lymph node enlargement was found in 34\/93 of cases (36.6%) with 29\/34 (85.3%) showing no additional source of infection. Fibrosis was seen in 16\/93 (17.2%) of cases, mainly demonstrating fibrotic organising pneumonia. Conclusion There is a high incidence of PTD in COVID -19 patients undergoing CTPA, complicated by lack of a valid risk stratification tool. Our data indicates a much higher suspicion of PTD is needed in severe COVID-19 patients. The concomitant presence of fibrotic features on CT indicates the need for follow-up for evaluation of chronic pulmonary complications.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cheng Fang","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Garzillo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bhavna Batohi","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Marko Berovic","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul Sidhu","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hasti Robbie","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Dezirae Schneider","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Berre Dogancay","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Guo","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Anne Wiedmer","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Julie Domange","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Marigona Imeri","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rita Moos","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Chryssa Zografou","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Chiara Trevisan","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Andres Gonzalez-Guerra","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Carrella","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Irina L.

Design: Online cross-sectional survey. Setting: Data were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020. Participants: 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. Participants were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. Main outcome measures: Having gone out in the last 24 hours in those who reported symptoms of COVID-19 in their household. Having gone out shopping for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines (non-essentials), and total number of outings, in the last week in those who reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in their household. Results: 217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature \/ fever) in the last seven days. Of these people, 75.1% had left the home in the last 24 hours (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence were being male, less worried about COVID-19, and perceiving a smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for non-essentials in the last week (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of Government \"lockdown\" measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19, and decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules. Having received help was associated with better adherence. Conclusions: Adherence to self-isolation is poor. As we move into a new phase of contact tracing and self-isolation, it is essential that adherence is improved. Communications should aim to increase knowledge about actions to take when symptomatic or if you have been in contact with a possible COVID-19 case.

Using volunteer networks effectively to support people in isolation may promote adherence.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise E.

However, overestimating these parameters may put the public and policymakers in a muddle. In this paper, an optimistic scenario is simulated, wherein the dynamics of the COVID-19 curve is allowed to spread to such an extent that the projections of the COVID-19 parameters do not take excessively high values. Based on this scenario, the ending life-cycle and cumulative cases for India and some of its states, are predicted. Our study, suggests that the fall of the peak amplitude (95%) of the major COVID-19 wave in India may take place by the 8th of September 2020 with a total count of 655000 cases. Simulation results, also indicate that Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan may end up with 263700, 18140, 50600, 21130, 24420, 44170, 27080, and 28200 cumulative cases respectively.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dr. Praveen Gupta","author_inst":"Government Polytechnic College, Jaipur, India"},{"author_name":"Prof. K.K.
