Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic. We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by individuals and the public therefore only influence the dynamics of spread of CoV-2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the officially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore offer robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries. Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we find that the long-run number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to be an absurdly large range for a precise projection, this reflects the uncertainty about the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will end up at 5 million cases. Defining the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals per day, we find a large variation depending on the effectiveness of governmental pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not influenced by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million. When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals will be around 200 thousand only. Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of August. We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection.

In the absence of effective vaccine or biomedical treatment, the basic rules of public health measures have not changed, namely public distancing. Methods: We analyzed epidemiological investigation reports during the first month of the outbreak in Israel. In addition, we present a deterministic compartment model and simulations of several scenarios emphasizing quarantine and isolation policies given their efficiency. Results: We identify an abrupt change from controlled epidemic regime to an exponential growth (R_0= 2.19) in light of the actual policy-makers decisions and public behavior in Israel. Our analysis show that before the abrupt change, the new cases trend was due to returning citizens infected abroad. The abrupt change followed a holiday in which social distancing was clearly inefficient and many public gatherings were held. We further discuss three different modeled scenarios of quarantine efficiency: high-, medium-, and low-efficiency. Conclusions: Israel early lessons show that there is no allowance to compromise with the directive of social distancing. Even before the onset of the pandemic in Israel, fine-tuned but determined early decisions were taken by policy makers to monitor flight arrivals from Covid-19 affected regions and to limit public gatherings. Our analysis show that one particular holiday has shifted the occurrence curve from controlled regime to exponential growth. Therefore, even a short lapse in public responsiveness can have a dramatic effect.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ziv Klausner","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eyal Fattal","author_inst":"Israeli Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Eitan Hirsch","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C Shapira","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20044099","rel_title":"COVID-19 transmission in Mainland China is associated with temperature and humidity: a time-series analysis","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20044099","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has become a pandemic.

A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004-0.07) in Hubei. Every 1{degrees}C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04{degrees}C to 8.2{degrees}C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongchao Qi","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Fudan University, China.

The research community is interested to know what are the hotspots in coronavirus (CoV) research and how much is known about COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis. Methods: We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eight-topic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission at present. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only accounted for less than 10% or even 4% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections.

According to the high prevalence of new coronavirus, further investigation on the clinical and paraclinical features of this disease seems essential. Hence, we carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to figure out the unknown features. Methods: This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers which reported clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19. We used STATA v.11 and random effect model for data analysis. Results: In the present meta-analysis, 32 papers including 49504 COVID-19 patients were studied. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (84%), cough (65%) and fatigue (42%), respectively. The most common radiological and paraclinical features were bilateral pneumonia (61%), ground-glass opacity (50%), thrombocytopenia (36%) and lymphocytopenia (34%). The study also showed that the frequency of comorbidities and early symptoms was higher in critically severe patients. Moreover, we found the overall mortality rate of three percent. Conclusion: According to that there are many cases without Computed Tomography Scan findings or clear clinical symptoms, it is recommended to use other confirming methods such RNA sequencing in order to identification of suspicious undiagnosed patients. Moreover, while there is no access to clinical and paraclinical facilities in in public places such as airports and border crossings, it is recommended to consider factors such as fever, cough, sputum and fatigue.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Keyvan Heydari","author_inst":"Student Research Committee, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.

Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosites exhibited glycoform heterogeneity as expected for a human cell-expressed protein subunits. We identified masses that correspond to 157 N-glycans, primarily of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, primarily of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsACE2angiotensin-converting enzyme IICryo-EMcryoelectron microscopyEenvelope proteinHCoV-NL63human coronavirus NL63Mmembrane proteinMSmass spectrometryMERS-CoVMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirusNnucleocapsid proteinRBDreceptor-binding domainSspike proteinSARS-CoV-2severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusSCEstepped collision energyZic-HILICzwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographyView Full Text","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanjun Zhao","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Mao","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yaohui Chen","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Shisheng Wang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhong","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Tao Su","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Meng Gong","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Du","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Lu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jingqiu Cheng","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hao Yang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.010975","rel_title":"Comparative performance of four nucleic acid amplification tests for SARS-CoV-2 virus","rel_date":"2020-03-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.010975","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be screened and diagnosed through the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

Results showed that the analytical sensitivity of the four assays was significantly lower than that claimed by the NAAT manufacturers. The limit of detection (LOD) of Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs was 3000 copies\/mL, whereas the LOD of Bioperfectus NAATs was 4000 copies\/mL.

The sensitivity of Bioperfectus NAAT was lower than that of the three other NAATs; this finding was consistent with the result that Bioperfectus NAAT had a higher LOD than the three other kinds of NAATs. The four above mentioned reagents presented high specificity; however, for the detection of the samples with low virus concentration, Bioperfectus reagent had the risk of missing detection.

Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely underappreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to type II pneumocytes and olfactory epithelial cells. We further identify mature small intestinal enterocytes as a possible hotspot of COVID-19 fecal-oral transmission, where an intriguing maturation-correlated transcriptional signature is shared between ACE2 and the other coronavirus receptors DPP4 (MERS-CoV) and ANPEP (-coronavirus).

Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease varies in different countries. This variation is attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here, we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by different national policies with respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection from other respiratory infections besides tuberculosis. We compared BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19 for middle-high and high-income countries. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, the Netherlands, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. The difference cannot be accounted for by differences in disease onset, adoption of early social distancing policies, state of health services, nor income level. Reduced mortality suggests BCG vaccination could be a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aaron Miller","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mac Josh Reandelar","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College os Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Fasciglione","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Violeta Roumenova","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo H Otazu","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ramakrishna Chilaka","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Dariusz K Murakowski","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Kristopher Standish","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Bharathwaj Raghunathan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Enrique Garcia-Rivera","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Hugo Solomon","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Garg","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Barve","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Anuli Anyanwu-Ofili","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.009233","rel_title":"Design of potent membrane fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, an emerging coronavirus with high fusogenic activity","rel_date":"2020-03-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.009233","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by emerging SARS-CoV-2, has posed serious threats to global public health, economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this study, we firstly verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased -helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities.

The predicted models were further improved by applying molecular dynamics simulation-based refinement. We also took the AlphaFold models and refined them by applying the same refinement method.

The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, but also in the design of accurate diagnostics.\n\nWe analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher-frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host but also strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A \/ poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene.\n\nOur results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements, reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timokratis Karamitros","author_inst":"Unit of Bioinformatics and Applied Genomics, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Gethsimani Papadopoulou","author_inst":"Unit of Bioinformatics and Applied Genomics, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Maria Bousali","author_inst":"Unit of Bioinformatics and Applied Genomics, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Anastasios Mexias","author_inst":"Unit of Bioinformatics and Applied Genomics, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sotiris Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Academic Department of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Athens, Greece."},{"author_name":"Andreas Mentis","author_inst":"Public Health Laboratories, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Ramakrishna Chilaka","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Dariusz K Murakowski","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Kristopher Standish","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Bharathwaj Raghunathan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Enrique Garcia-Rivera","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Hugo Solomon","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Garg","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Barve","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Anuli Anyanwu-Ofili","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.012013","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 and ORF3a: Non-Synonymous Mutations and Polyproline Regions","rel_date":"2020-03-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.012013","rel_abs":"The effect of the rapid accumulation of non-synonymous mutations on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.

Mutations were correlated with changes in epitope formation. A total of 19 different non-synonymous amino acids substitutions were detected in ORF3a among 537 SARS-CoV-2 strains. G251V was the most common and identified in 9.9% (n=53) of the strains and was predicted to lead to the loss of a B-cell like epitope in ORF3a.

Understanding the humoral antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins may help identify biomarkers that can be used to detect and treat COVID-19 infection. However, no immuno-proteomics platform exists that can perform such proteome-wide analysis. To address this need, we created a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptides 15 amino acids long with 5-amino acid offsets representing full-length SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Moreover, the array processing time is short (1.5 hours), the dynamic range is ~2 orders of magnitude, and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg\/mL. Here, the SARS-CoV-2 proteome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for SARS-CoV-1 proteins can also target SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These readily available reagents could be used immediately in COVID-19 research. Second, IgM and IgG immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were profiled in the serum of ten COVID-19 patients. Such epitope biomarkers provide insight into the immune response to COVID-19 and are potential targets for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine development. Finally, serological antibodies that may neutralize viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor were identified. Further investigation into whether these antibodies can inhibit the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.

The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key CoV enzyme that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, which makes it an attractive drug target. In an effort to rapidly discover lead compounds targeting Mpro, two compounds (11a and 11b) were designed and synthesized, both of which exhibited excellent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.05 M and 0.04 M respectively. Significantly, both compounds exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in a cell-based assay with an EC50 value of 0.42 M and 0.33 M, respectively. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11a and 11b were determined at 1.5 [A] resolution, respectively. The crystal structures showed that 11a and 11b are covalent inhibitors, the aldehyde groups of which are bound covalently to Cys145 of Mpro. Both compounds showed good PK properties in vivo, and 11a also exhibited low toxicity which is promising drug leads with clinical potential that merits further studies.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenhao Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bing Zhang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xia-Ming Jiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haixia Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yao Zhao","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xiong Xie","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhenming Jin","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Peng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fengjiang Liu","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Chunpu Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"You Li","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Haofeng Wang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xi Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Cen","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Shulei Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Material Medica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.010694","rel_title":"The Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Abolished Pluripotency in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","rel_date":"2020-03-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.010694","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is raging across the world, leading to a global mortality rate of 3.4% (estimated by World Health Organization in March 2020). As a potential vaccine and therapeutic target, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoVN) functions in packaging the viral genome and viral self-assembly. To investigate the biological effects of nCoVN to human stem cells, genetically engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) expressing nCoVN (iPSC-nCoVN) were generated by lentiviral expression systems, in which the expression of nCoVN could be induced by the doxycycline. The proliferation rate of iPSC-nCoVN was decreased. Unexpectedly, the morphology of iPSC started to change after nCoVN expression for 7 days. The pluripotency marker TRA-1-81 were not detectable in iPSC-nCoVN after a four-day induction. Meanwhile, iPSC-nCoVN lost the ability for differentiation into cardiomyocytes with a routine differentiation protocol. The RNA-seq data of iPSC-nCoVN (induction for 30 days) and immunofluorescence assays illustrated that iPSC-nCoVN were turning to fibroblast-like cells. Our data suggested that nCoVN disrupted the pluripotent properties of iPSC and turned them into other types of cells, which provided a new insight to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zebin Lin","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiming Wu","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicin"},{"author_name":"Jinlian Mai","author_inst":"Guangdong Beating Origin Regenerative Medicine Co.

A recent study investigated translatome and proteome host cell changes induced in vitro by SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we use the publicly available proteomics data from this study to re-analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis. Proteins linked to inflammatory response, but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis, were found to be regulated. The up-regulation of the inflammatory-related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reaction and lung injury that is observed in advanced stages of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ignacio Ortea","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigacion e Innovacion Biomedica de Cadiz (INiBICA)"},{"author_name":"Jens-Ole Bock","author_inst":"Cobo Technologies Aps"},{"author_name":"Jinlian Mai","author_inst":"Guangdong Beating Origin Regenerative Medicine Co.

Using sequence alignments spanning a range of betacoronaviruses, we rank genomic regions by RNA sequence conservation, identifying 79 regions of length at least 15 nucleotides as exactly conserved over SARS-related complete genome sequences available near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. We then confirm the conservation of the majority of these genome regions across 739 SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported to date from the current COVID-19 outbreak, and we present a curated list of 30  SARS-related-conserved regions. We find that known RNA structured elements curated as Rfam families and in prior literature are enriched in these conserved genome regions, and we predict additional conserved, stable secondary structures across the viral genome. We provide 106  SARS-CoV-2-conserved-structured regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA. We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the 5 UTR, frame-shifting element, and 3 UTR. Last, we predict regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome have low propensity for RNA secondary structure and are conserved within SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Design: We enrolled adult COVID-19 patients from a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan with a definitive diagnosis by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in which the patient selected COVID-19-related symptoms and report the time of onset and duration of symptoms. Results: A total of 212 adults were enrolled in this study, of which 127 (59.9%) were females, mean age was 48.50 (range: 17-79) years, and mean disease course was 26.78 (3-60) days. Fever and cough were the most common and earliest clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Diarrhoea occurred in 43.8% (93\/212) of patients, of which 86.0% (80\/93) had mushy stools. Nausea and vomiting were also common (20.7%). Diarrhoea lasted for 4.00(2.00-8.85) days and mostly occurred 5.00(0.25-11.00) days after the emergence of the first symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that diarrhoea was significantly correlated with fatigue [OR2.900,95%CI (1.629-5.164), p<0.0001].

As of 22 March, 2020, South Korea reported 8897 confirmed cases of and 104 deaths from COVID-19. Methods: We collected the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths in South Korea from the World Health Organization (as of 21 March, 2020) and case distribution and fatality rates by age from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (as of 22 March, 2020). We estimated population-level mortality rates by fitting a negative binomial regression model with the number of deaths as the outcome and population by age as an offset. We then calculated the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) based on the current COVID-19 figures and for alternative scenarios of increased prevalence. Findings: The COVID-19 population-level mortality rate (per 100,000 person-years) increased with age: from 0.1 deaths among 30-39 year olds to 9.5 deaths among [&ge;]80 year olds. The ASDR (per 100,000 person-years) was 0.8 deaths. The ASDR would increase to 52.0 deaths at a 1% prevalence (becoming the third leading cause of death) and 155.9 deaths at 3% prevalence (becoming the leading cause of death). Interpretation: Currently, the population-level mortality burden of COVID-19 in South Korea, as measured by the ASDR, was relatively low compared to other causes of death partly due to the low prevalence of COVID-19.

We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. A total of 128 patients were admitted. 102 patients were confirmed to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using RNA detection. As of March 20, 82 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 5 remained hospitalized. The median age was 57 years (range, 27 - 85), 59 (58%) were male, and 44 (43%) patients had a comorbidity. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. When compared with survivors, non-survivors were older and more likely to have lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated d-dimer, and increased hypersensitive troponin I. In a multivariate regression model that included these predictors, older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality. Twenty-one survivors and 11 non-survivors had CT scans within the first week. We used severity score to quantify the extent of lung opacification as described in the Supplementary Appendix. The total severity score and number of involved lung lobes within the first week were significantly greater in non-survivors compared to survivors . Using univariate logistic regression analysis, higher total severity score ([&ge;]15) (odds ratio 53, 95% CI 3-369; p = 0.003), and more involved lung lobes (5 involved lobes) (9, 2-53; p = 0.016) in CT images within the first week were significantly associated with fatality. Moreover, in this subset of patients with CT data within the first week, higher total severity score was the only independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporated the predictors discussed above (older age, lymphocytopenia, elevated LDH, elevated d-dimer, and increased troponin I). For survivors with serial CT scans performed over four weeks, total severity score peaked in the second week. This report suggests that the extent of lung lesions in early CT images is a potential predictor of poor outcome of Covid-19. This will help clinicians to identify the patients with poor prognosis at early stage.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaiyan Li","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dian Chen","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shengchong Chen","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuchen Feng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chenli Chang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zi Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Nan Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Guohua Zhen","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital of Huazhong Universtiy of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wiznia","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fengjiang Liu","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Chunpu Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"You Li","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Haofeng Wang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xi Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Cen","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Shulei Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Material Medica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041061","rel_title":"Clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041061","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND There is little information about the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19. METHODS In this retrospective analysis from five hospitals, we included pregnant women with Covid-19 from January 1 to February 20, 2020. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women and newborns. RESULTS Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. The rate of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.6%. CONCLUSIONS This report suggests that pregnant women are not at increased risk for severe illness or mortality with Covid-19 compared with the general population. The SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy might not be associated with as adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes that are seen with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection during pregnancy.

In this study we built a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. we will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases deaths and recovered for the whole country. Method: In this study we have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time seires from weighted averages of past daily values of the series. This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree more recent values are given a greater weight. The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season. Trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time. Results: If no control measures are put in place it is expected that over 40000 would be infected in Tehran around the middle of June. However if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success one would expect the spread of the COV19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend dropping off by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario that no further measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID19 to continue on a gentle incline reaching 21000 by mid-June. The same process has been applied to review the confirmed deaths and recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the Iranian New Years celebration Farvardin first month of Spring (30th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event. The best predictive model predicts the confirmed cases to be in the range of 35000 70000 with the number of reported COVDI-19 deaths to be between 3000 5000 and 5000 30000 of recovered cases. Conclusions: Modeling outbreak ofCovid19 shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be Haves this one. This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person. Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing. In addition many factors are effective in stopping the disease. These include citizens participation in the prevention process health education the effectiveness of instructive traditions environmental conditions and so on.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maryam Moghadami","author_inst":"Tehran university"},{"author_name":"Maryam Moghadami","author_inst":"Tehran University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Hassanzadeh","author_inst":"Tarbiat Modare University"},{"author_name":"ka wa","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Aziz Hedayati","author_inst":"Shahid Madani Azarbayjan University"},{"author_name":"Mila Malekolkalami","author_inst":"Tarbiat Modares University"},{"author_name":"Mei Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Jinmen Second People's Hospital, Jinmen, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng-cheng Liu","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Yichang Central People's Hospital, The First College of Clinical Medical, Three Gorges University, Yichang, Hubei, Chin"},{"author_name":"Wan-jiang Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Jian-li Wu","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Kutluk Oktay","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Ling Feng","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Jin","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Haofeng Wang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Xi Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Cen","author_inst":"National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs"},{"author_name":"Shulei Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihe Rao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Material Medica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"}]}
