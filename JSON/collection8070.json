Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and handwashing access is limited. Objectives: To estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1062 locations from 1990 to 2019. Results: Despite overall improvements from 1990 (34.7% [95% uncertainty interval 32.5-36.7] without access) to 2019 globally, in 2019, 2.01 (1.89-2.13) billion people equal to 26.0% (24.4-27.6) of the global population lacked access to handwashing. More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa were without access to handwashing in 2019, while in eight countries, more than 50 million persons lacked access. Discussion: For populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative strategies are urgently needed, while disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Brauer","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia; Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation"},{"author_name":"Jeff T Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation"},{"author_name":"Fiona B Bennitt","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D Stanaway","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.028902","rel_title":"Optimization of SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-QPCR without RNA extraction","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.028902","rel_abs":"Rapid and reliable screening of SARS-CoV-2 is fundamental to assess viral spread and limit the pandemic we are facing.

Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of -48.1 kcal\/mol ({+\/-} 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as -82.0 kcal\/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of -52.2 kcal\/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning-driven designs. This technical report is a high-level description of that effort; the Supplementary Materials includes the homology-based structural models we developed and 178,856 in silico free energy calculations for 89,263 mutant antibodies derived from known SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Desautels","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Adam Zemla","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Edmond Lau","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Franco","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Daniel Faissol","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Andre Poirier","author_inst":"Centre de sante et de services sociaux de Trois-Rivieres"},{"author_name":"Hugo Germain","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res"},{"author_name":"Alexis Danylo","author_inst":"Centre Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 Universitaire de sant\u00e9 et services sociaux de la Mauricie et Centre du Qu\u00e9bec"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20057356","rel_title":"The Immediate Effect of COVID-19 Policies on Social Distancing Behavior in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20057356","rel_abs":"Anecdotal evidence points to the effectiveness of COVID-19 social distancing policies, however, their effectiveness vis-a-vis what is driven by public awareness and voluntary actions have not been studied.

However, most were not echoed by the patients clinical manifestations, largely due to the lack of protein expression information of ACE2 and co-factors. Here, we incorporated the protein information to analyse the expression of ACE2, together with TMPRSS2 and Furin, two proteases assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection, at single cell level in situ, which we called protein-proofed single-cell RNA (pscRNA) profiling. Systemic analysis across 36 tissues revealed a rank list of candidate cells potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. The top targets are lung AT2 cells and macrophages, then cardiomyocytes and adrenal gland stromal cells, followed by stromal cells in testis, ovary and thyroid. Whereas, the polarized kidney proximal tubule cells, liver cholangiocytes and intestinal enterocytes are less likely to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 targets as ACE2 localizes at the apical region of cells, where the viruses may not readily reach. Actually, the stomach may constitute a physical barrier against SARS-CoV-2 as the acidic environment in normal stomach (pH < 2.0) could completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-viruses. These findings are in concert with the clinical characteristics of prominent lung symptoms, frequent heart injury, and uncommon intestinal symptoms and acute kidney injury. Together, we provide a comprehensive view on the potential SARS-CoV-2 targets by pscRNA profiling, and propose that, in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, attentions should also be paid to the potential injuries in cardiovascular, endocrine and reproductive systems during the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lulin Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of Biotechnology, 20 Dongda Street, Beijing 100071, P.R.

To date, this outbreak has infected more than one million people and killed over fifty thousand people across the world. In most countries, the COVID-19 incidence curve rises sharply in a short span of time, suggesting a transition from a disease free (or low-burden disease) equilibrium state to a sustained infected (or high-burden disease) state. Such a transition from one stable state to another state in a relatively short span of time is often termed as a critical transition. Critical transitions can be, in general, successfully forecasted using many statistical measures such as return rate, variance and lag-1 autocorrelation. Here, we report an empirical test of this forecasting on the COVID-19 data sets for nine countries including India, China and the United States. For most of the data sets, an increase in autocorrelation and a decrease in return rate predict the onset of a critical transition. Our analysis suggests two key features in predicting the COVID-19 incidence curve for a specific country: a) the timing of strict social distancing and\/or lockdown interventions implemented, and b) the fraction of a nation's population being affected by COVID-19 at the time of implementation of these interventions. Further, using satellite data of nitrogen dioxide which is emitted predominantly as a result of anthropogenic activities, as an indicator of lockdown policy, we find that in countries where the lockdown was implemented early and strictly have been successful in reducing the extent of transmission of the virus. These results hold important implications for designing effective strategies to control the spread of infectious pandemics.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Taranjot Kaur","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Ropar"},{"author_name":"Sukanta Sarkar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Ropar"},{"author_name":"Sourangsu Chowdhury","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, 55128 Mainz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sudipta Kumar Sinha","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Ropar"},{"author_name":"Mohit Kumar Jolly","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Partha Sharathi Dutta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Ropar"},{"author_name":"Yichao Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Biotechnology, 20 Dongda Street, Beijing 100071, P.R.

It is a highly contagious positive strand RNA virus and its clinical presentation includes severe to critical respiratory disease that appears to be fatal in [~]3-5% of the cases. The viral spike (S) coat protein engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) cell surface protein to invade the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has acquired mutations that increase its affinity to human ACE2 by [~]10-15-fold compared to SARS-CoV S-protein, making it highly infectious. In this study, we assessed if ACE2 polymorphisms might alter host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by affecting the ACE2 S-protein interaction. Our comprehensive analysis of several large genomic datasets that included over 290,000 samples representing >400 population groups identified multiple ACE2 protein-altering variants, some of which mapped to the S-protein-interacting ACE2 surface. Using recently reported structural data and a recent S-protein-interacting synthetic mutant map of ACE2, we have identified natural ACE2 variants that are predicted to alter the virus-host interaction and thereby potentially alter host susceptibility. In particular, human ACE2 variants S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, T27A, N64K, T92I, Q102P and H378R are predicted to increase susceptibility. The T92I variant, part of a consensus NxS\/T N-glycosylation motif, confirmed the role of N90 glycosylation in immunity from non-human CoVs. Other ACE2 variants K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V, Y50F, N51S, M62V, K68E, F72V, Y83H, G326E, G352V, D355N, Q388L and D509Y are putative protective variants predicted to show decreased binding to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein. Overall, ACE2 variants are rare, consistent with the lack of selection pressure given the recent history of SARS-CoV epidemics, however, are likely to play an important role in altering susceptibility to CoVs.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric W Stawiski","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Devan Diwanji","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA and Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology Un"},{"author_name":"Kushal Suryamohan","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Ravi Gupta","author_inst":"MedGenome Labs Ltd., 3rd Floor, Narayana Netralaya Building, Narayana Health City, #258\/A, Bommasandra, Hosur Road, Bangalore, Karnataka 560099, India"},{"author_name":"Frederic A Fellouse","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, Accelerator for Donnelly Collaboration, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada"},{"author_name":"Fah Sathirapongsasuti","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Jiang Liu","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Ying-Ping Jiang","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Aakrosh Ratan","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA"},{"author_name":"Monika Mis","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Devi Santhosh","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Sneha Somasekar","author_inst":"Midwestern University, Glendale, AZ 85308, USA"},{"author_name":"Sangeetha Mohan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, SciGenom Labs Pvt Ltd, Kerala 682037, India"},{"author_name":"Sameer Phalke","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, SciGenom Labs Pvt Ltd, Kerala 682037, India"},{"author_name":"Boney Kuriakose","author_inst":"AgriGenome Labs Private Ltd, Kochi, Kerala 682030, India"},{"author_name":"Aju Antony","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, SciGenom Labs Pvt Ltd, Kerala 682037, India"},{"author_name":"Jagath R Junutula","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 348 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404"},{"author_name":"Stephan C Schuster","author_inst":"Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637551, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Natalia Jura","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA and Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology Un"},{"author_name":"Somasekar Seshagiri","author_inst":"SciGenom Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600020, India; ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20055244","rel_title":"Data model to predict prevalence of COVID-19 in Pakistan","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20055244","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) has spread to 181 countries and regions and leaving behind 1,133,788 confirmed cases and 62784 deaths worldwide.

To further promote the implementation of a universal community droplet reduction solution based on a synchronized encouragement\/enforcement of mask utilization by the public based on widely available textiles (mask fabrication without the need for sewing machines), here we conducted a study using germ-free mice to determine to what extent textiles were effective in vivo. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which 100% cotton textile prevented the contamination of germ-free animals on the other side of the textile-barrier (simulating a properly worn mask). Of relevance, all mice protected with textiles remained germ-free after two sprays (inoculation dose: >600 bacterial droplet units per 56.75cm2) compared to the contamination of mice not protected by a textile (0\/12 vs 6\/6, Fishers exact, p<0.0001). In a second phase of the experiment with 12 germ-free mice exposed again to 10-fold more droplets remained germ-free, while 100% of mice at 180cm became colonized with a single spray (0\/8 vs 4\/4, Fisher exact, p=0.002). Collectively, barriers protected all mice (even with low-density textiles, heavy vs. light fabric, T-test, p=0.0028) when using textile-EDB to cover the cages (0\/20 vs 10\/10, Fisher exact, p<0.0001).

Understanding which cell types are targeted by SARS-CoV-2 virus, whether interspecies differences exist, and how variations in cell state influence viral entry is fundamental for accelerating therapeutic and preventative approaches. In this endeavor, we profiled the transcriptome of nine tissues from a Macaca fascicularis monkey at single-cell resolution. The distribution of SARS-CoV-2 facilitators, ACE2 and TMRPSS2, in different cell subtypes showed substantial heterogeneity across lung, kidney, and liver. Through co-expression analysis, we identified immunomodulatory proteins such as IDO2 and ANPEP as potential SARS-CoV-2 targets responsible for immune cell exhaustion. Furthermore, single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis of the kidney unveiled a plausible link between IL6-mediated innate immune responses aiming to protect tissue and enhanced ACE2 expression that could promote viral entry.

It is noteworthy that the disease has its greatest impact on the elderly. Herein, we investigated the potential of childhood vaccination, specifically against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), to identify if this could potentially confer acquired protection over SARS-CoV-2. We identified sequence homology between the fusion proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and measles and mumps viruses. Moreover, we also identified a 29% amino acid sequence homology between the Macro (ADP-ribose-1-phosphatase) domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus. The rubella Macro domain has surface-exposed conserved residues and is present in the attenuated rubella virus in MMR. Hence, we hypothesize that MMR could protect against poor outcome in COVID-19 infection. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we identified that 1) age groups that most likely lack of MMR vaccine-induced immunity had the poorest outcome in COVID-19, and 2) COVID-19 disease burden correlates with rubella antibody titres, potentially induced by SARS-CoV2 homologous sequences.

Thorough validation of serological tests are required to facilitate their use in the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmation of molecular results, contact tracing, and epidemiological studies. This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of nine commercially available serological tests. These included three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and six point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests. The assays were validated using serum samples from: i) SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients with a documented first day of disease; ii) archived sera obtained from healthy individuals before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China; iii) sera from patients with acute viral respiratory tract infections caused by other coronaviruses or non-coronaviruses; and iv) sera from patients positive for dengue virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. The results showed 100% specificity for the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody ELISA, 93% for the Euroimmun IgA ELISA, and 96% for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA with sensitivities of 90%, 90%, and 65%, respectively. The overall performance of the POC tests according to manufacturer were in the rank order of AutoBio Diagnostics > Dynamiker Biotechnology = CTK Biotech > Artron Laboratories > Acro Biotech [&ge;] Hangzhou Alltest Biotech. Overall, these findings will facilitate selection of serological assays for the detection SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies towards diagnosis as well as sero-epidemiological and vaccine development studies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ria Lassauni\u00e8re","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anders Frische","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Zitta B Harboe","author_inst":"Nordsjaellands Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Alex CY Nielsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anders Fomsgaard","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Karen A Krogfelt","author_inst":"Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark and Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Charlotte S J\u00f8rgensen","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Ying Lei","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Lai","author_inst":"Laboratory of Integrative biology, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, CAS, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Carl Ward","author_inst":"Laboratory of Integrative biology, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, CAS, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Yeya Yu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mingyue Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Quan Shi","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Wu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Wu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Ya Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Chunqing Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanhang Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Haixi Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Yu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenkun Zhuang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Tingting Tang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yunting Huang","author_inst":"China National GeneBank, BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518120, China"},{"author_name":"Haorong Lu","author_inst":"China National GeneBank, BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518120, China"},{"author_name":"Liqin Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jiangshan Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mengnan Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Chi Wai Wong","author_inst":"Huazhen Biosciences, Guangzhou 510900, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Tan","author_inst":"Yunnan Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research, Institute of Primate Translational Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500,"},{"author_name":"Weizhi Ji","author_inst":"Yunnan Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research, Institute of Primate Translational Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500,"},{"author_name":"Patrick H.

This disparity may reflect different airway levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and the spike protein activator, TMPRSS2. Here we explore the role of genetics and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency across world populations. Importantly, we find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by T2 inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and that interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. Finally, we define airway responses to coronavirus infections in children, finding that these infections upregulate IL6 while also stimulating a more pronounced cytotoxic immune response relative to other respiratory viruses. Our results reveal mechanisms likely influencing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Satria P Sajuthi","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Peter DeFord","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Jackson","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Michael T Montgomery","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Jamie L Everman","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Cydney L Rios","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Elmar Pruesse","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"James D Nolin","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth G Plender","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Michael E Wechsler","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Angel CY Mak","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Celeste Eng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sandra Salazar","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Vivian Medina","author_inst":"Centro de Neumologia Pediatrica"},{"author_name":"Eric M Wohlford","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scott Huntsman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Soren Germer","author_inst":"New York Genome Center"},{"author_name":"Michael C Zody","author_inst":"New York Genome Center"},{"author_name":"Goncalo Abecasis","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Hyun Min Kang","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Kenneth M Rice","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Sam Oh","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jose Rodriguez-Santana","author_inst":"Centro de Neumologia Pediatrica"},{"author_name":"Esteban G Burchard","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Max A Seibold","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Mengnan Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Chi Wai Wong","author_inst":"Huazhen Biosciences, Guangzhou 510900, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Tan","author_inst":"Yunnan Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research, Institute of Primate Translational Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500,"},{"author_name":"Weizhi Ji","author_inst":"Yunnan Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research, Institute of Primate Translational Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500,"},{"author_name":"Patrick H.

We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin. Methods: New user cohort studies were conducted including 16 severe adverse events (SAEs). Rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 18+ and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared to those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days. Self-controlled case series (SCCS) were conducted to further establish safety in wider populations. Separately, SAEs associated with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (compared to hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (CalHRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where I2<40%. Results: Overall, 956,374 and 310,350 users of hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine, and 323,122 and 351,956 users of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin were included. No excess risk of SAEs was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. SCCS confirmed these findings. However, when azithromycin was added to hydroxychloroquine, we observed an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (CalHR2.19 [1.22-3.94]), chest pain\/angina (CalHR 1.15 [95% CI 1.05-1.26]), and heart failure (CalHR 1.22 [95% CI 1.02-1.45]) Conclusions: Short-term hydroxychloroquine treatment is safe, but addition of azithromycin may induce heart failure and cardiovascular mortality, potentially due to synergistic effects on QT length. We call for caution if such combination is to be used in the management of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":78,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Rijnbeek","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jennifer C.E Lane","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Selva Muthu Kumaran Sathappan","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Singapore"},{"author_name":"James Weaver","author_inst":"Janssen Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Martijn Schuemie","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Kostka","author_inst":"Real World Solution, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sarah Seager","author_inst":"Real World Solution, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Fundaci\u00f3 Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Anthony Sena","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza F.

However, the current shortage in RNA extraction reagents as well as limitations in qPCR protocols have resulted in bottlenecks in testing capacity. Herein, we describe a novel molecular diagnostic for COVID-19 based on Sanger sequencing. This assay uses the addition of a frame-shifted spike-in, a modified PCR master mix, and custom Sanger sequencing data analysis to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a limit of detection comparable to existing qPCR-based assays, at 10-20 genome copy equivalents. Crucially, our assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from viral particles suspended in transport media that was directly added to the PCR master mix, suggesting that RNA extraction can be skipped entirely without any degradation of test performance. Since Sanger sequencing instruments are widespread in clinical laboratories and commonly have built-in liquid handling automation to support up to 3840 samples per instrument per day, the widespread adoption of qSanger COVID-19 diagnostics can unlock more than 1,000,000 tests per day in the US.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Devon Chandler-Brown","author_inst":"BillionToOne, Inc."},{"author_name":"Anna M.

As a matter of fact, a new SARS-type virus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible of a global pandemic in 2020 with unprecedented sanitary and economic consequences for most countries. In the present contribution we study, by all-atom equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, the interaction between the SARS Unique Domain and RNA guanine quadruplexes, a process involved in eluding the defensive response of the host thus favoring viral infection of human cells. Our results evidence two stable binding modes involving an interaction site spanning either the protein dimer interface or only one monomer. The free energy profile unequivocally points to the dimer mode as the thermodynamically favored one. The effect of these binding modes in stabilizing the protein dimer was also assessed, being related to its biological role in assisting SARS viruses to bypass the host protective response. This work also constitutes a first step of the possible rational design of efficient therapeutic agents aiming at perturbing the interaction between SARS Unique Domain and guanine quadruplexes, hence enhancing the host defenses against the virus.\n\nTOC GRAPHICS\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/029447v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (99K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1497e69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a4c44org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1511b7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13e12c1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cecilia Hognon","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Tom Miclot","author_inst":"Universita di Palermo"},{"author_name":"Cristina Garcia Iriepa","author_inst":"Universitad de Alcala"},{"author_name":"Antonio France-Monerris","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Grandemange","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Alessio Terenzi","author_inst":"Universita di Palermo"},{"author_name":"Marco Marazzi","author_inst":"Universidad de Alacala"},{"author_name":"Giampaolo Barone","author_inst":"Universita di Palermo"},{"author_name":"Antonio Monari","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza F.

Vaccine and therapeutic discovery efforts are paramount to curb the pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S identified from memory B cells of a SARS survivor infected in 2003. One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-binding domain. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants. These results pave the way for using S309 and S309-containing antibody cocktails for prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dora Pinto","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Young-Jun Park","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Martina Beltramello","author_inst":"Humabs BioMed SA"},{"author_name":"Alexandra C.

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected over one million people worldwide as of April, 2020, and has led to the deaths of nearly 300,000 people. No approved vaccines or treatments in the USA currently exist for COVID-19, so there is an urgent need to develop effective countermeasures. The IMPDH inhibitor merimepodib (MMPD) is an investigational antiviral drug that acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH. It has been demonstrated to suppress replication of a variety of emerging RNA viruses. We report here that MMPD suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. After overnight pretreatment of Vero cells with 10 M of MMPD, viral titers were reduced by 4 logs of magnitude, while pretreatment for 4 hours resulted in a 3-log drop. The effect is dose-dependent, and concentrations as low as 3.3 M significantly reduced viral titers when the cells were pretreated prior to infection. The results of this study provide evidence that MMPD may be a viable treatment option for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalya Bukreyeva","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Emily K Mantlo","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Rachel A Sattler","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Cheng Huang","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Slobodan Paessler","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jerry Zeldis","author_inst":"ViralClear, a subsidiary of BioSig, Inc."},{"author_name":"Stefano Jaconi","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Katja Culap","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Fabrizia Zatta","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Anna De Marco","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Alessia Peter","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Barbara Guarino","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Roberto Spreafico","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cameroni","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rita E.

We tested 21 domestic pets (9 cats and 12 dogs) living in close contact with their owners (belonging to a veterinary community of 20 students) in which two students tested positive for COVID-19 and several others (n = 11\/18) consecutively showed clinical signs (fever, cough, anosmia, etc.) compatible with COVID-19 infection. Although a few pets presented many clinical signs indicative for a coronavirus infection, no animal tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and no antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in their blood using an immunoprecipitation assay.

In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInhibition of the JAK1 kinase prevents pathology and mortality caused by a rampant innate immune response in mice.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kathryn Tuttle","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Ross Minter","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Katherine Waugh","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Paula Araya","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Michael Ludwig","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Colin Sempeck","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Keith Smith","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Zdenek Andrysik","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Matthew Burchill","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Beth Tamburini","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"David Orlicky","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Kelly D Sullivan","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Espinosa","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rita E.
