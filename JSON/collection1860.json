We have used a bioinformatic approach to aid in the design of an epitope peptide-based vaccine against the spike protein of the virus. Five antigenic B cell epitopes with viable antigenicity and a total of 27 discontinuous B cell epitopes were mapped out structurally in the spike protein for antibody recognition. We identified eight CD8+ T cell 9-mers along with 12 CD4+ T cell 14-15-mer as promising candidate epitopes putatively restricted by a large number of MHC-I and II alleles respectively. We used this information to construct an in silico chimeric peptide vaccine whose translational rate was highly expressed when cloned in pET28a (+) vector. The vaccine construct was predicted to elicit high antigenicity and cell-mediated immunity when given as a homologous prime-boost, with triggering of toll-like receptor 5 by the adjuvant linker. The vaccine was characterized by an increase in IgM and IgG and an array of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Upon in silico challenge with SARS-CoV-2, there was a decrease in antigen levels using our immune simulations. We therefore propose that potential vaccine designs consider this approach.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Onyeka S.

The positive single strand RNA genome of its causative agent, the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encodes all viral enzymes. In this work, we focus on one particular methyltransferase (MTase), nsp16, which in complex with nsp10 is capable of methylating the first nucleotide of a capped RNA strand at the 2'-O position. This process is part of a viral capping system and is crucial for viral evasion of the innate immune reaction. In light of recently discovered non-canonical RNA caps, we tested various dinucleoside polyphosphate-capped RNAs as substrates for nsp10-nsp16 MTase. We developed an LC-MS-based method and discovered five types of capped RNA (m7Gp3A(G)-, Gp3A(G)- and Gp4A-RNA) that are substrates of the nsp10-nsp16 MTase. Our technique is an alternative to the classical isotope labelling approach for measurement of 2'-O-MTase activity. Further, we determined the IC50 value of sinefungin (286 {+\/-} 66 nM) to illustrate the value of our approach for inhibitor screening. In the future, this approach can be used for screening inhibitors of any type of 2'-O-MTase.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberto Benoni","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Petra Krafcikova","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Marek Baranowski","author_inst":"Division of Biophysics, Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Joanna Kowalska","author_inst":"Division of Biophysics, Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw, Ludwika Pasteura 5, 02-093 Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Evzen Boura","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Hana Cahova","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Richard A Adewole","author_inst":"University of Lagos"},{"author_name":"Daniel M Eze","author_inst":"University of Ibadan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.229187","rel_title":"A dynamic regulatory interface on SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.229187","rel_abs":"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is the core machinery responsible for the viral genome replication and transcription and also a major antiviral target. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a post-translocated SARS-CoV-2 RdRp core complex, comprising one nsp12, one separate nsp8(I) monomer, one nsp7-nsp8(II) subcomplex and a replicating RNA substrate. Compared with the recently reported SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complexes, the nsp8(I)\/nsp7 interface in this RdRp complex shifts away from the nsp12 polymerase. Further functional characterizations suggest that specific interactions between the nsp8(I) and nsp7, together with the rearrangement of nsp8(I)\/nsp7 interface, ensure the efficient and processive RNA synthesis by the RdRp complex. Our findings provide a mechanistic insight into how nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors regulate the polymerase activity of nsp12 and suggest a potential new intervention interface, in addition to the canonical polymerase active center, in RdRp for antiviral design.\n\nAuthor summarySince it was first discovered and reported in late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus is wreaking havoc around the world. Currently, no highly effective and specific antiviral drug is available for clinical treatment. Therefore, the threat of COVID-19 transmission necessitates the discovery of more effective antiviral strategies. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important antiviral drug target. Here, our cryo-EM structure of a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp\/RNA replicating complex reveals a previously uncharacterized overall shift of the cofactor nsp8(I)\/nsp7 interface, leading to its rearrangement. Through in vitro functional test, we found that the specific interactions on the interface are important to the efficient RNA polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. These observations let us to suggest this interface as a potential new drug intervention site, outside of the canonical polymerase active center, in RdRp for antiviral design. Our findings would provide new insights into regulatory mechanism of this novel SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, contribute to the design of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, and benefit the global public health.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Shi","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ming Chen","author_inst":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yang Yang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiyun Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Yangbo Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Bin Liu","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Daniel M Eze","author_inst":"University of Ibadan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.227470","rel_title":"Ad26-vector based COVID-19 vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike immunogen induces potent humoral and cellular immune responses","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.227470","rel_abs":"Development of effective preventative interventions against SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19 is urgently needed. The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g. prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S1) increased the ratio of neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively-folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-{gamma}. This optimized Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04436276).","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rinke Bos","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lucy Rutten","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Joan E.M. van der Lubbe","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mark J.G.

Whether the appearance of cell-free MT-DNA is linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes remains undetermined. Here, we quantified circulating MT-DNA in prospectively collected, cell-free plasma samples from 97 subjects with COVID-19 at the time of hospital presentation. Circulating MT-DNA were sharply elevated in patients who eventually died, required ICU admission or intubation. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that high circulating MT-DNA levels is an independent risk factor for all of these outcomes after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. Additionally, we found that circulating MT-DNA has a similar or superior area-under-the curve when compared to clinically established measures of systemic inflammation, as well as emerging markers currently of interest as investigational targets for COVID-19 therapy. These results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels is a potential indicator for poor COVID-19 outcomes.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davide Scozzi","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Marlene Cano","author_inst":"Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Lina MA","author_inst":"Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Dequan Zhou","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Ji Hong Zhu","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Charles Goss","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Adriana Rauseo","author_inst":"Divisions of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Zhiyi Liu","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Valentina Peritore","author_inst":"Division of Thoracic Surgery, Department of medical-surgical science and translational medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Monica Rocco","author_inst":"Division of Anesthesiology, Department of medical-surgical science and translational medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alberto Ricci","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rachele Amodeo","author_inst":"Laboratory analysis-flow cytometry section, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Aimati","author_inst":"Laboratory analysis-flow cytometry section, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mohsen Ibrahim","author_inst":"Division Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, US; Division Thoracic Surgery, Department me"},{"author_name":"Ramsey Hachem","author_inst":"Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kreisel","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Philip A Mudd","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Hrishikesh S Kulkarni","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine; Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Lo"},{"author_name":"Andrew E Gelman","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery; Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri"},{"author_name":"Vellinga Jort","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Johannes PM Langedijk","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Roland C Zahn","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerome Custers","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hanneke Schuitemaker","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.229377","rel_title":"Cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV structural protein antibodies against SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.229377","rel_abs":"There is currently a lack of biological tools to study the replication cycle and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19.

Several trials testing a variety of therapeutics are on-going. Some in-vitro studies found the anti-malarial drug chloroquine (CQ), and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are effective against COVID19. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials in humans have produced conflicting findings on the efficacy and safety of these drugs. Guidelines vary considerably and are hotly debated at political and scientific levels. Therefore, it has become necessary to provide a summary of the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in treating COVID19 infection, using an overview of the existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Objective To synthesize the findings presented in systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as to update the evidence using a meta-analysis in evaluating the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ with or without Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID19 infection. Methods The design of this meta-review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Systematic Reviews including harms checklist (PRIO-harms). A comprehensive search included several electronic databases in identifying all systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as experimental studies which investigated the efficacy and safety of CQ, HCQ with or without antibiotics as COVID19 treatment. Manual searches of the reference list of all included studies and a citation search of the top 20 papers supplemented the search. Findings from the systematic reviews and meta-analyses were reported using a structured summary including tables and forest plots. The updated meta-analysis of experimental studies was carried out using the distributional-assumption-free quality effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool for reviews and the MethodologicAl STandard for Epidemiological Research (MASTER) scale for the experimental studies. The main outcomes for both the meta-review and the updated meta-analysis were; mortality, transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), intubation or the need for mechanical ventilation, worsening of illness, viral clearance and the occurrence of adverse events. Results A total of 13 reviews with 40 primary studies comprising 113,000 participants were included. Most of the primary studies were observational (n=27) and the rest were experimental studies. Two meta-analyses reported a high risk of mortality with similar ORs of 2.5 for HCQ with Azithromycin. However, four other meta-analyses reported contradictory results with two reporting a high risk of mortality (OR ~ 2.2 to 3.0) and the other two reporting no significant association between HCQ with mortality. Most reviews reported that HCQ with or without Azithromycin had no significant effect on virological cure, disease exacerbation or the risk of transfer to the ICU, need for intubation or mechanical ventilation. After exclusion of studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria, the updated meta-analysis contained eight experimental studies (7 RCTs and 1 quasi-experimental trial), with a total of 5279 participants of whom 1856 were on either CQ\/HCQ or combined with Azithromycin. CQ\/HCQ with or without Azithromycin was significantly associated with a higher risk of adverse events (RR 5.7, 95%CI 2.4-13.7, I2 =55%, n = 5 studies). HCQ was not effective in reducing mortality (RR 1.0, 95%CI 1.0-1.2, I2 =0%, n=6 studies), transfer to the ICU, intubation or need for mechanical ventilation (RR 1.1, 95%CI 0.9-1.4, I2 =0%, n=3 studies) virological cure (RR 1.0, 95%CI 0.9-1.2, I2 =55%, n=5 studies) nor disease exacerbation (RR 1.2, 95%CI 0.3-5.0, I2 =29%, n=3 studies). Conclusion There is conclusive evidence that CQ and HCQ, with or without Azithromycin are not effective in treating COVID-19 or its exacerbation.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tawanda Chivese","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Omran A.H.

We study the divide between anti-vaxxers and vaxxers in the context of whom they follow. More specifically, we look at followership of 1) the U.S. Congress members, 2) four major religions (Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism and Islam), 3) accounts related to the healthcare community, and 4) news media accounts. Our results indicate that there is a partisan divide between vaxxers and anti-vaxxers. We find a religious community with a higher than expected fraction of anti-vaxxers. Further, we find that the variance of vaccine belief within the news media accounts operated by Russian and Iranian governments is higher compared to news media accounts operated by other governments. Finally, we provide messaging and policy implications to inform the COVID-19 vaccine and future vaccination plans.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aman Tyagi","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M.

Objective: To evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients having CRS treated with Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) as compared to controls not receiving TPE. Design: Retrospective propensity score (PS) matched analysis, 1st April to 30th June 2020. Setting: Tertiary care hospital, single centre based. Participants: Using PS 1:1 matching, 90 patients were assigned 2 groups (45 receiving TPE and 45 controls). Forced matching and covariate matching was done to overcome bias between two groups. Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcome was 28 days overall survival. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalization, CRS resolution time and timing of PCR negativity. Results: Median age was 60 years (range 32-73 in TPE, 37-75 in non-TPE group), p= 0.325. Median symptoms duration 7 days (range 3-22 days TPE and 3-20 days non-TPE), p=0.266.

Twenty-eight-day survival was significantly superior in TPE group (91.1%) as compared to controls (61.5%), HR 0.21, 95% CI for HR 0.09-0.53, log rank 0.002. Median duration of hospitalization was significantly reduced in TPE treated group as compared to non-TPE controls 10 days and 15 days respectively (p< 0.01). CRS resolution time was also significantly reduced in TPE treated group (6 days vs. 12 days) (p< 0.001). Conclusion and Relevance: Use of TPE is associated with superior overall survival, early CRS resolution and time to discharge as compared to standard therapy for COVID-19 triggered CRS.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"sultan mehmood kamran","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital (PEMH) Rawalpindi"},{"author_name":"Zill -e Humayun Mirza","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi (PEMH)"},{"author_name":"Arshad Naseem","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi"},{"author_name":"Jahanzeb Liaqat","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi"},{"author_name":"Imran Fazal","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi"},{"author_name":"Wasim Alamgir","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi"},{"author_name":"Farrukh Saeed","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi"},{"author_name":"Rizwan Azam","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maryam Hussain","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ali Yousaf","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadeem Ashraf","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Shazia Nisar","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Zafar Ali","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Salman Saleem","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Kaswar Sajjad","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Asad Zaman","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi"},{"author_name":"Malik Nadeem Azam","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Mehmood Hussain","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"raheel iftikhar","author_inst":"AFBMTC"},{"author_name":"Vellinga Jort","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Johannes PM Langedijk","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Roland C Zahn","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerome Custers","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hanneke Schuitemaker","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.23.20160424","rel_title":"A Retrospective Study on Efficacy and Safety of Guduchi Ghan Vati for Covid-19 Asymptomatic Patients","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.23.20160424","rel_abs":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has been declared global emergency with immediate safety, preventative and curative measures to control the spread of virus. Confirmed cases are treated with clinical management as they are diagnosed but so far, there is no effective treatment or vaccine yet for Covid-19. Ayurveda has been recommended by preventative and clinical management guidelines in India and several clinical trials are ongoing. But there is no study to assess impact of Ayurveda on Covid-19. Methods Objective of present study was to evaluate the clinical outcome in Covid-19 confirmed asymptomatic to mild symptomatic patients who had received Ayurveda and compare with control (who has not received Ayurveda or any support therapy). Patients having Ayurveda intervention (Guduchi Ghan Vati-extract of Tinospora cordifolia) were included from Jodhpur Covid Care Centre and non-recipients were taken from Jaipur Covid Care Centre between May 15 to June 15, 2020. Total 91 patients, who were asymptomatic at the time of hospital admission and between 18 -75 years of age, were included in the study to analyse retrospectively. Results In control group, 11.7% developed mild symptoms after average 1.8 days and none in Ayurveda group reported any symptoms. Significant difference was reported between the group of patients taking Guduchi Ghan Vati (n=40) and patients in standard care (n=51) in terms of virologic clearance at day-7 (97.5% vs 15.6% respectively; p=0.000), at day 14 (100% vs 82.3%) days to stay in hospital ( 6.4 vs 12.8 respectively; p< 0.0001) .

Real-time PCR involves a rate limiting step where the samples are measured in situ during each PCR amplification cycle. This creates a bottleneck limiting scalability and as a consequence reducing access to inexpensive reliable testing at national and international scales. We investigated endpoint PCR for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 sequences on synthetic RNA standards and hospital patient samples. The endpoint PCR detection limit is constrained only by the stochastics of low copy numbers and reliably detected single copies of synthetic RNA standards. On a set of 30 patient samples, endpoint PCR found one additional positive sample and was able to confirm an indeterminate sample as negative. These results were found using 4 l reagent and 1 l of sample representing an 80% reduction relative to the NHS protocol (20 l reagent and 5 l sample). These results indicate that endpoint PCR should be the method of choice for large scale testing programmes.

This study aimed to describe key patient characteristics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes of a large U.S.-based cohort of patients hospitalized with COVD-19 using electronic health records (EHR). METHODS: We identified patients in the Optum De-identified COVID-19 EHR database who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a presumptive diagnosis between 20 February 2020 and 6 June 2020. We included hospitalizations that occurred 7 days prior to, or within 21 days after, COVID-19 diagnosis. Among hospitalized patients we describe the following: vital statistics and laboratory results on admission, relevant comorbidities (using diagnostic, procedural, and revenue codes), medications (NDC, HCPC codes), ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. RESULTS: We identified 76,819 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 16,780 of whom met inclusion criteria for COVID-related hospitalization. Over half the cohort was over age 50 (74.5%), overweight or obese (77.2%), or had hypertension (56.6%). At admission, 30.3% of patients presented with fever (>38C) and 32.3% had low oxygen saturation (<90%). Among the 16,099 patients with complete hospital records, we observed that 58.9% had hypoxia, 23.4% had an ICU stay during hospitalization, 18.1% were ventilated, and 16.2% died. The median LOS was 6 days (IQR: 4, 11). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest descriptive study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States. We report summary statistics of key clinical outcomes that provide insights to better understand COVID-19 disease epidemiology.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shemra Rizzo","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Devika Chawla","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Kelly Zalocusky","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Daniel Keebler","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Jenny Chia","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Lisa Lindsay","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Vincent Yau","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Tripthi Kamath","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Larry Tsai","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ali Yousaf","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadeem Ashraf","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Shazia Nisar","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Zafar Ali","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Salman Saleem","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Kaswar Sajjad","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Asad Zaman","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi"},{"author_name":"Malik Nadeem Azam","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Mehmood Hussain","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"raheel iftikhar","author_inst":"AFBMTC"},{"author_name":"Vellinga Jort","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Johannes PM Langedijk","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Roland C Zahn","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerome Custers","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hanneke Schuitemaker","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20151423","rel_title":"Resveratrol and Copper for treatment of severe COVID-19: an observational study (RESCU 002)","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20151423","rel_abs":"Background To be universally applicable in treatment of severe COVID-19, novel therapies, especially those with little toxicity and low cost, are urgently needed. We report here the use of one such therapeutic combination involving two commonly used nutraceuticals, namely resveratrol and copper in patients with this disease. This study was prompted by pre-clinical reports that sepsis-related cytokine storm and fatality in mice can be prevented by oral administration of small quantities of resveratrol and copper. Since cytokine storm and sepsis are major causes of death in severe COVID-19, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients with this condition who had received resveratrol and copper. Methods & Findings Our analysis comprised of 230 patients with severe COVID-19 requiring inhaled oxygen who were admitted in a single tertiary care hospital in Mumbai between April 1 and May 13 2020. Thirty of these patients received, in addition to standard care, resveratrol and copper at doses of 5.6 mg and 560 ng, respectively, orally, once every 6 hours, until discharge or death. These doses were based on our pre-clinical studies, and were nearly 50 times and 2000 times less, respectively, than those recommended as health supplements. A multivariable-adjusted analysis was used to model the outcome of death in these patients and evaluate factors associated with this event. A binary logistic regression analysis was used, with age, sex, presence of comorbidities and receipt of resveratrol-copper as covariates. Data were updated as of May 30 2020. The number of deaths in resveratrol-copper and standard care only groups were 7\/30 (23.3%, 95% CI 8.1%-38.4%) and 89\/200 (44.5%, 95% CI 37.6%-51.3%), respectively. In multivariable analysis, age >50 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.558, 95% CI 1.454-4.302, P=0.0011] and female sex (OR 1.939, 95% CI 1.079-3.482, P=0.0267) were significantly associated, while presence of co-morbidities was not significantly associated (OR 0.713, 95% CI 0.405-1.256, P=0.2421) with death. There was a trend towards reduction in death in patients receiving resveratrol-copper (OR 0.413, 95% CI 0.164-1.039, P= 0.0604). Conclusions We provide preliminary results of a novel approach to the treatment of severe COVID-19 using a combination of small amounts of commonly used nutraceuticals, which is non-toxic and inexpensive, and therefore could be widely accessible globally. The nearly two-fold reduction in mortality with resveratrol-copper observed in our study needs to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Indraneel Mittra","author_inst":"Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie de Souza","author_inst":"BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Bhadade","author_inst":"BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Tushar Madke","author_inst":"BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"P.D.

Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much attention being paid to body mass index (BMI), but little investigation has been done to investigate dysregulation of lipid profiles and diabetes, which are often comorbid in high BMI patients. Objective This study seeks to describe the impact of BMI, HDL, LDL, ApoA, ApoB, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), diabetes, alcohol and red wine intake on SARS-CoV-2 risk in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants. Methods We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the risk of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16 through June 29, 2020. Logistic regression was performed on the target variables controlling for age, sex and ancestry. Results BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 risk (p < 0.05) while HDL and ApoA were associated with decreased risk (p < 0.001). Additionally, red wine intake was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 risk (p < 0.05). LDL, ApoB and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased risk. Conclusion Elevated HDL and ApoA levels and alcohol intake, specifically red wine intake, were associated with reduced risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased risk. The effects of alcohol, type II diabetes and HbA1c levels may be indirect, mediated in part through regulation of HDL levels. In summary, our study corroborates the emerging picture that high HDL levels may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan J Scalsky","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karan Desai","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ju Chen","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeff R O'Connell","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James A Perry","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles C Hong","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Burhanuddin Qayyumi","author_inst":"Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Atanu Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Vikram Gota","author_inst":"Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Sudeep Gupta","author_inst":"Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, India."},{"author_name":"Pankaj Chaturvedi","author_inst":"Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, India."},{"author_name":"Rajendra Badwe","author_inst":"Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Zafar Ali","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Salman Saleem","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Kaswar Sajjad","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Asad Zaman","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi"},{"author_name":"Malik Nadeem Azam","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Mehmood Hussain","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi Pakistan"},{"author_name":"raheel iftikhar","author_inst":"AFBMTC"},{"author_name":"Vellinga Jort","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Johannes PM Langedijk","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Roland C Zahn","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerome Custers","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hanneke Schuitemaker","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.26.20162347","rel_title":"A HYBRID KNOWLEDGE-BASED AND MODIFIED REGRESSION ANALYSIS APPROACH FOR COVID-19 TRACKING IN USA","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.26.20162347","rel_abs":"Since its appearance in 2019, the covid-19 virus deluged the world with unprecedented data in short time.

It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that requires the ACE2 receptor and serine proteases to enter airway epithelial cells (AECs). Objective: To determine what factors are associated with ACE2 expression particularly in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: We obtained upper and lower AECs from 145 people from two independent cohorts, aged 2-89, Newcastle (n=115), and from Perth (n= 30) Australia. The Newcastle cohort was enriched with people with asthma (n=37) and COPD (n=38). Gene expression for ACE2 and other genes potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 cell entry were assessed by quantitative PCR, protein expression was confirmed with immunohistochemistry on endobronchial biopsies and cultured AECs. Results: Increased gene expression of ACE2 was associated with older age (p=0.02) and male sex (p=0.03), but not pack-years smoked. When we compared gene expression between adults with asthma, COPD and healthy controls, mean ACE2 expression was lower in asthma (p=0.01). Gene expression of furin, a protease that facilitates viral endocytosis, was also lower in asthma (p=0.02), while ADAM-17, a disintegrin that cleaves ACE2 from the surface was increased (p=0.02). ACE2 protein levels were lower in endobronchial biopsies from asthma patients. Conclusions: Increased ACE2 expression occurs in older people and males. Asthma patients have reduced expression. Altered ACE2 expression in the lower airway may be an important factor in virus tropism and may in part explain susceptibility factors and why asthma patients are not over-represented in those with COVID-19 complications.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Wark","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Prabuddha Pathinyake","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New "},{"author_name":"Gerard Kaiko","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Kristy Nichol","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New "},{"author_name":"Ayesha Ali","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Ling Chen","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Erika Suntanto","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Luke Garrat","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sukhwinder S Sohal","author_inst":"Respiratory Translational Research Group, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, "},{"author_name":"Wenying Lu","author_inst":"Respiratory Translational Research Group, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, "},{"author_name":"Matthew Eapen","author_inst":"Respiratory Translational Research Group, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, "},{"author_name":"Christopher Oldmeadow","author_inst":"Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nathan Bartlett","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Andrew Reid","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Punnam Veerati","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Alan Hsu","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New "},{"author_name":"Thomas Iosifides","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Stick","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Philip M Hansbro","author_inst":"Centre for Inflammation, Centenary Institute, and Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia"},{"author_name":"Anthony Kicic","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Johannes PM Langedijk","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Roland C Zahn","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerome Custers","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hanneke Schuitemaker","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20162743","rel_title":"How much reserve capacity is justifiable for hospital pandemic preparedness?

The purpose of this study was to determine the costs and benefits of this strategy in Germany. Methods: This study compared the provision of additional capacity to no intervention from a societal perspective. A decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU costs and outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated based upon the willingness to pay for new medicines for the treatment of cancer, a condition with a similar disease burden in the near term. Results: The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (MCER) of supplying one additional ICU bed is 24,815 euros per life year gained and increases with the number of additional beds. The NMB remains positive for utilization rates as low as 1.5% and, assuming full capacity utilization, for multiples of the currently available bed capacity. Expanding the ICU bed capacity by 10,000 beds is projected to result in societal costs of 41 billion euros and to reduce mortality of ICU candidates by 20% compared with no intervention (assuming full capacity utilization). In a sensitivity analysis, the variables with the highest impact on the MCER were the mortality rates in the ICU and after discharge. Conclusions: In Germany, the provision of additional ICU bed capacity appears to be cost-effective over a large increase in the number of beds. Nevertheless, bed utilization is constrained by labor supply and possibly other input factors.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Afschin Gandjour","author_inst":"Frankfurt School of Finance & Management"},{"author_name":"Prabuddha Pathinyake","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New "},{"author_name":"Gerard Kaiko","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Kristy Nichol","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New "},{"author_name":"Ayesha Ali","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Ling Chen","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Erika Suntanto","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Luke Garrat","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sukhwinder S Sohal","author_inst":"Respiratory Translational Research Group, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, "},{"author_name":"Wenying Lu","author_inst":"Respiratory Translational Research Group, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, "},{"author_name":"Matthew Eapen","author_inst":"Respiratory Translational Research Group, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, "},{"author_name":"Christopher Oldmeadow","author_inst":"Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nathan Bartlett","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Andrew Reid","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Punnam Veerati","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Alan Hsu","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New "},{"author_name":"Thomas Iosifides","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Stick","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Philip M Hansbro","author_inst":"Centre for Inflammation, Centenary Institute, and Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia"},{"author_name":"Anthony Kicic","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Johannes PM Langedijk","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Roland C Zahn","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerome Custers","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hanneke Schuitemaker","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20162636","rel_title":"The German Corona Consensus Dataset (GECCO): A standardized dataset for COVID-19 research","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20162636","rel_abs":"Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge of research activity. While this research provides important insights, the multitude of studies results in an increasing segmentation of information. To ensure comparability across projects and institutions, standard datasets are needed. Here, we introduce the \"German Corona Consensus Dataset\" (GECCO), a uniform dataset that uses international terminologies and health IT standards to improve interoperability of COVID-19 data. Methods: Based on previous work (e.g., the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form) and in coordination with experts from university hospitals, professional associations and research initiatives, data elements relevant for COVID-19 research were collected, prioritized and consolidated into a compact core dataset. The dataset was mapped to international terminologies, and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was used to define interoperable, machine-readable data formats. Results: A core dataset consisting of 81 data elements with 281 response options was defined, including information about, for example, demography, anamnesis, symptoms, therapy, medications or laboratory values of COVID-19 patients. Data elements and response options were mapped to SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, ICD-10-GM and ATC, and FHIR profiles for interoperable data exchange were defined. Conclusion: GECCO provides a compact, interoperable dataset that can help to make COVID-19 research data more comparable across studies and institutions. The dataset will be further refined in the future by adding domain-specific extension modules for more specialized use cases.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian Sass","author_inst":"Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Bartschke","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Moritz Lehne","author_inst":"Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andrea Essenwanger","author_inst":"Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Rinaldi","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Rudolph","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kai Uwe Heitmann","author_inst":"health innovation hub of the Federal Ministry of Health, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Joerg Janne Vehreschild","author_inst":"Medical Department 2, Hematology \/ Oncology, University Hospital of Frankfurt, Germany | Department I for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, German"},{"author_name":"Christof von Kalle","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Thun","author_inst":"Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthew Eapen","author_inst":"Respiratory Translational Research Group, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, "},{"author_name":"Christopher Oldmeadow","author_inst":"Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nathan Bartlett","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Andrew Reid","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Punnam Veerati","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Alan Hsu","author_inst":"Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute and School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New "},{"author_name":"Thomas Iosifides","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Stick","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Philip M Hansbro","author_inst":"Centre for Inflammation, Centenary Institute, and Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia"},{"author_name":"Anthony Kicic","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Western Australia, Australia"},{"author_name":"Johannes PM Langedijk","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Roland C Zahn","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerome Custers","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hanneke Schuitemaker","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20162867","rel_title":"A machine learning explanation of the pathogen-immune relationship of SARS-CoV-2 and machine learning models of prognostic biomarkers to predict asymptomatic or symptomatic infections","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20162867","rel_abs":"Asymptomatic people infected during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic have outnumbered symptomatic people by an approximate ratio of 4:1 with little understanding to date as to why; therefore, they have been impossible to identify in advance.

Early diagnosis and isolation is key to contain the rapid spread of the virus. Towards this goal, we report a simple, sensitive and rapid method to detect the virus using a targeted mass spectrometric approach, which can directly detect the presence of virus from naso-oropharyngeal swabs. Using a multiple reaction monitoring we can detect the presence of two peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2 in a 2.3 minute gradient run with 100% specificity and 90.4 % sensitivity when compared to RT-PCR. Importantly, we further show that these peptides could be detected even in the patients who have recovered from the symptoms and have tested negative for the virus by RT-PCR highlighting the sensitivity of the technique. This method has the translational potential of in terms of the rapid diagnostics of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 and can augment current methods available for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Praveen Singh","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Rahul Chakraborty","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Robin Marwal","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Radhakrishan V S","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Akash Kumar Bhaskar","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Himanshu Vashisht","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Mahesh S Dhar","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Shalini Pradhan","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Gyan Ranjan","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Imran","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Anurag Raj","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Uma Sharma","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Singh","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Hemlata Lall","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Meena Dutta","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Parth Garg","author_inst":"Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology"},{"author_name":"Arjun Ray","author_inst":"Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology"},{"author_name":"Debasis Dash","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Sridhar Sivasubbu","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Hema Gogia","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Preeti Madan","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Sandhya Kabra","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agrawal","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakhit","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Pramod Kumar","author_inst":"National Center for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Shantanu Sengupta","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.26.20162255","rel_title":"Magnetic bead-based ELISA allow inexpensive, rapid and quantitative detection of human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.26.20162255","rel_abs":"Here we describe a novel immunogenic method to detect COVID-19.

As a proof of concept, we compared the performance of our new method to classical ELISA. Person correlation between optical densities obtained using the two methods was 0.98. The novel magnetic bead-based ELISA performed better than classic ELISA to discriminate one COVID-19 case carrying low antibody titer. The chromogenic magnetic bead-based ELISA method described here can be applied in formats for both point of care and high throughput analysis. The method is readily adaptable to use other protein-based antigens and is readily adaptable to investigate other diseases and other applications.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luciano F Huergo","author_inst":"UFPR"},{"author_name":"Marcelo S Conzentino","author_inst":"UFPR"},{"author_name":"Edileusa C M Gerhardt","author_inst":"UFPR"},{"author_name":"Adrian R.S.

Among 26 hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19 (median age, 62 years, 20 [77%] males), bevacizumab plus standard care markedly improved the PaO2\/FiO2 ratios at days 1 and 7 (elevated values, day 1, 50.5 [4.0,119.0], p<0.001; day 7, 111.0 [85.0,165.0], p<0.001). By day 28, 24 (92%) patients showed improvement in oxygen-support status, 17 (65%) patients were discharged, and none showed worsen oxygen-support status nor died. Significant reduction of lesion areas and ratios were shown in chest CT or X-ray analysis within 7 days. Of 14 patients with fever, body temperature normalized within 72 hours in 13 (93%) patients. Lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood were significantly increased and CRP levels were markedly decreased as shown in available data. Our findings suggested bevacizumab plus standard care was highly beneficial for treating patients with severe Covid-19.

Michigan Medicine, being one of the primary regional centers accepting COVID-19 cases, provided an ideal setting for studying COVID-19 repeated testing patterns during the first wave of the pandemic. Objective To identify the characteristics of patients who underwent repeated testing for COVID-19 and determine if repeated testing was associated with patient characteristics and with downstream outcomes among positive cases. Design This cross-sectional study described the pattern of testing for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine. The main hypothesis under consideration is whether patient characteristics differed between those tested once and those who underwent multiple tests. We then restrict our attention to those that had at least one positive test and study repeated testing patterns in patients with severe COVID-19 related outcomes (testing positive, hospitalization and ICU care). Setting Demographic and clinical characteristics, test results, and health outcomes for 15,920 patients presenting to Michigan Medicine between March 10 and June 4, 2020 for a diagnostic test for COVID-19 were collected from their electronic medical records on June 24, 2020. Data on the number and types of tests administered to a given patient, as well as the sequences of patient-specific test results were derived from records of patient laboratory results. Participants Anyone tested between March 10 and June 4, 2020 at Michigan Medicine with a diagnostic test for COVID-19 in their Electronic Health Records were included in our analysis. Exposures Comparison of repeated testing across patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and patient outcomes Main Outcomes and Measures Whether patients underwent repeated diagnostic testing for SARS CoV-2 in Michigan Medicine Results Between March 10th and June 4th, 19,540 tests were ordered for 15,920 patients, with most patients only tested once (13596, 85.4%) and never testing positive (14753, 92.7%). There were 5 patients who got tested 10 or more times and there were substantial variations in test results within a patient. After fully adjusting for patient and neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) and demographic characteristics, patients with circulatory diseases (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: (1.18, 1.72)), any cancer (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: (1.01, 1.29)), Type 2 diabetes (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: (1.06, 1.39)), kidney diseases (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: (1.71, 2.23)), and liver diseases (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: (1.11, 1.50)) were found to have higher odds of undergoing repeated testing when compared to those without. Additionally, as compared to non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks were found to have higher odds (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: (1.03, 1.43)) of receiving additional testing. Females were found to have lower odds (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: (0.76, 0.96)) of receiving additional testing than males. Neighborhood poverty level also affected whether to receive additional testing. For 1% increase in proportion of population with annual income below the federal poverty level, the odds ratio of receiving repeated testing is 1.01 (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: (1.00, 1.01)). Focusing on only those 1167 patients with at least one positive result in their full testing history, patient age in years (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: (1.00, 1.03)), prior history of kidney diseases (OR: 2.15; 95% CI: (1.36, 3.41)) remained significantly different between patients who underwent repeated testing and those who did not. After adjusting for both patient demographic factors and NSES, hospitalization (OR: 7.44; 95% CI: (4.92, 11.41)) and ICU-level care (OR: 6.97; 95% CI: (4.48, 10.98)) were significantly associated with repeated testing. Of these 1167 patients, 306 got repeated testing and 1118 tests were done on these 306 patients, of which 810 (72.5%) were done during inpatient stays, substantiating that most repeated tests for test positive patients were done during hospitalization or ICU care. Additionally, using repeated testing data we estimate the \"real world\" false negative rate of the RT-PCR diagnostic test was 23.8% (95% CI: (19.5%, 28.5%)). Conclusions and Relevance This study sought to quantify the pattern of repeated testing for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine. While most patients were tested once and received a negative result, a meaningful subset of patients (2324, 14.6% of the population who got tested) underwent multiple rounds of testing (5,944 tests were done in total on these 2324 patients, with an average of 2.6 tests per person), with 10 or more tests for five patients. Both hospitalizations and ICU care differed significantly between patients who underwent repeated testing versus those only tested once as expected. These results shed light on testing patterns and have important implications for understanding the variation of repeated testing results within and between patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Salerno","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Zhangchen Zhao","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Swaraaj Prabhu Sankar","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Salvatore","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Tian Gu","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lars G.

Thus, COVID-19s daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. Covid-19 epidemic in Italy started as a small wave of 2 infected cases on January 31. It was followed by a bigger wave mainly from local transmissions reported in 6387 cases on March 8. It caused the government to impose a lockdown on 8 March to the whole country as a way to suppress the pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the lockdown and awareness dynamics on infection in Italy over the period of January 31 to July 17 and how the impact varies across different lockdown scenarios in both periods before and after implementation of the lockdown policy. The findings SEIR reveal that implementation lockdown has minimised the social distancing flattening the curve. The infections associated with COVID-19 decreases with quarantine initially then easing lockdown will not cause further increasing transmission until a certain period which is explained by public high awareness. Completely removing lockdown may lead to sharp transmission second wave. Policy implementation and limitation of the study were evaluated at the end of the paper.

Such a strong departure from the homogeneity assumptions of traditional well-mixed compartment model is usually hypothesized to be the result of short-term super-spreader events, such as individual's extreme rate of virus shedding at the peak of infectivity while attending a large gathering without appropriate mitigation. However, heterogeneity can also arise through long-term, or persistent variations in individual susceptibility or infectivity. Here, we show how to incorporate persistent heterogeneity into a wide class of epidemiological models, and derive a non-linear dependence of the effective reproduction number R_e on the susceptible population fraction S. Persistent heterogeneity has three important consequences compared to the effects of overdispersion: (1) It results in a major modification of the early epidemic dynamics; (2) It significantly suppresses the herd immunity threshold; (3) It significantly reduces the final size of the epidemic. We estimate social and biological contributions to persistent heterogeneity using data on real-life face-to-face contact networks and age variation of the incidence rate during the COVID-19 epidemic, and show that empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City (NYC) and Chicago and all 50 US states provide a consistent characterization of the level of persistent heterogeneity. Our estimates suggest that the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, are close to the persistent heterogeneity herd immunity threshold following the first wave of the epidemic, thereby limiting the spread of infection to other regions during a potential second wave of the epidemic. Our work implies that general considerations of persistent heterogeneity in addition to overdispersion act to limit the scale of pandemics.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexei V Tkachenko","author_inst":"Brookhaven National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sergei Maslov","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Elbanna","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"George N Wong","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Zachary J Weiner","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Nigel Goldenfeld","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Seunggeun Lee","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Lynda D Lisabeth","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Thomas S Valley","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Sv\u00e6rke J\u00f8rgensen","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Kasper Iversen","author_inst":"Herlev University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rafael Bayarri-Olmos","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Peter Garred","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Mikkel-Ole Skjoedt","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Wenhai Sui","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Bailu Wang","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Shuo Wu","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Attila Kovacs","author_inst":"Hospital S.p.A.

We report the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the short-term course of OCD. We also assessed for predictors of relapse and emergence of COVID-19-themed obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Methods: A cohort of patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD (n=240) who were on regular follow-up at a tertiary care specialty OCD Clinic in India were assessed telephonically, about 2 months after the declaration of the pandemic ('pandemic' cohort). Data from the medical records of an independent set of patients with OCD (n=207) who were followed-up during the same period, one year prior, was used for comparison (historical controls). Results: The 'pandemic' group and historical controls did not differ in the trajectories of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scores (Chi-square for likelihood-ratio test of the Group x Time interaction = 2.73, p= 0.255) and relapse rate [21% vs 20%, adjusted odds ratio = 0.81 (95% CI 0.41 -1.59, p=0.535]. Pre-existing contamination symptoms and COVID-19-related health anxiety measured by the COVID-Threat Scale did not predict relapse. Only a small proportion of patients (6%) reported COVID-19-themed obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Limitations: Follow-up 2 months after pandemic declaration may be too early understand the true impact. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short-run, did not influence the course of illness in those who were on medications. It would be pertinent to evaluate the long-term impact of the pandemic on the course of OCD.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lavanya P Sharma","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Srinivas Balachander","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Abel Thamby","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Mahashweta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Chethana Kishore","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Vandita Shanbhag","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Jaisoorya TS","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Janardhanan C Narayanaswamy","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Shyam Sundar Arumugham","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore"},{"author_name":"YC Janardhan Reddy","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Sv\u00e6rke J\u00f8rgensen","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Kasper Iversen","author_inst":"Herlev University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rafael Bayarri-Olmos","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Peter Garred","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Mikkel-Ole Skjoedt","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Wenhai Sui","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Bailu Wang","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Shuo Wu","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Attila Kovacs","author_inst":"Hospital S.p.A.
