Potential drugs identified for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection include chloroquine (CQ), its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and the anesthetic propofol. Their mechanism of action in SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. Recently, anesthetics, both general and local, were shown to disrupt ordered lipid domains. These same lipid domains recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point and their disruption by cholesterol depletion decreases ACE2 recruitment and viral entry.\n\nMethodsViral entry was determined using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (SARS2-PV) and a luciferase reporter gene expressed by the virus after treatment of the cells with 50 M propofol, tetracaine, HCQ, and erythromycin. HCQ disruption of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) domains, and ACE2 receptor at nanoscale distances was monitored by direct stochastic reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then labeled with either fluorescent cholera toxin B (CTxB) or antibody and then fixed again prior to imaging. Cluster analysis of dSTORM images was used to determine size and number and cross pair correlation was used to determine trafficking of endogenously expressed ACE2 in and out of lipid domains.\n\nResultsPropofol, tetracaine, and HCQ inhibit SARS2-PV viral entry. HCQ directly perturbs both GM1 lipid rafts and PIP2 domains. GM1 rafts increased in size and number similar to anesthetic disruption of lipid rafts; PIP2 domains decreased in size and number. HCQ blocked both GM1 and PIP2 domains ability to attract and cluster ACE2.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts GM1 lipid rafts similar to propofol and other local or general anesthetics. Furthermore, we conclude disruption of GM1 raft function, and not the concentration of GM1 raft molecules, governs the antiviral properties of HCQ. HCQ disruption of the membrane appears to also disrupt the production of host defense peptide, hence an antimicrobial such as erythromycin could be an important combined treatment. Nonetheless erythromycin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may combine with HCQ to reduce infection.\n\nKEY POINTSQuestion: What is the molecular basis for antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine and propofol?\n\nFindings: Hydroxychloroquine disrupt lipid rafts similar to local and general anesthetics.\n\nMeaning: Since lipids cluster ACE2 and facilitate viral entry, hydroxychloroquine and anesthetics appear to inhibit viral entry by disrupting the lipid clustering and ACE2 localization.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zixuan Yuan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mahmud Arif Pavel","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hao Wang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Scott Hansen","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.03.20167221","rel_title":"Evaluating the impacts of release in Sao Paulo State (Brazil) on the epidemic of covid-19 based on mathematical model","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.20167221","rel_abs":"To flatten the curve of the natural epidemic of covid-19, many countries adopted lockdown or isolation resulting in the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, an important question arises about the strategies of release of isolated persons to avoid overloaded hospitals and increased deaths. Sao Paulo State (Brazil) implemented the isolation of the population in non- essential activities on March 24, and the progressive flexibilization considering the characteristics of each location (release of the isolated population) initiated on June 15. A mathematical model based on the natural history of covid-19 was applied to describe the epidemiological scenario with isolation in Sao Paulo State, and assess the impact of release on the covid-19 epidemic. Using data collected from Sao Paulo State, we estimated the model parameters to obtain the curves of the epidemic, the number of deaths, and the clinical evolution of covid-19. The epidemic under isolation was the framework to evaluate the strategies of the release, that is, how these curves are changed with the release of isolated persons. We evaluated three strategies of release. First two strategies considered four releases in the isolated population in four equal proportions, but successive releases elapsed by 14 and 21 days. In each strategy the beginning of the release was on June 29 and July 13, when the effective reproduction number Ref was evaluated. The third strategy aimed at the protection of the elder subpopulation. We observed that the delay to begin the release and the increased elapse between successive releases resulted in a better scenario by decreasing severe covid-19 cases and, consequently, to avoid overloaded hospitals. We also observed that the release delayed to achieve lower values for Ref and infectious persons retarded in several months the quick increasing phase of the forthcoming epidemic. However, this epidemic can be flattened or even suppressed by isolation of infectious persons by mass testing and\/or by rigid adoption of protective measures and social distancing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyun Mo Yang","author_inst":"Unicamp"},{"author_name":"Luis Pedro Pedro Lombardi Junior","author_inst":"State University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Ariana Campos Yang","author_inst":"General Hospital of the Medicine School of University of S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fabio Fernandes Morato Castro","author_inst":"General Hospital of the Medicine School of University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.09.20170977","rel_title":"Effect of covid-19 lockdown on child protection medical assessments: a retrospective observational study in Birmingham, UK.","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.09.20170977","rel_abs":"Objectives To determine any change in referral patterns and outcomes in children (0-18) referred for child protection medical examination (CPME) during the covid-19 pandemic compared to previous years. Design Retrospective observational study, analysing routinely collected clinical data from CPME reports in a rapid response to the pandemic lockdown. Setting Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, which provides all routine CPME for Birmingham, England, population 1.1 million including 288,000 children. Participants Children aged under 18 years attending CPME during an 18 week period from late February to late June during the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Main Outcome Measures Numbers of referrals, source of disclosure and outcomes from CPME Results There were 78 CPME referrals in 2018, 75 in 2019 and 47 in 2020, this was a 39.7% (95%CI 12.4-59.0) reduction in referrals from 2018 to 2020, and a 37.3% (95%CI 8.6-57.4) reduction from 2019 to 2020. There were fewer CPME referrals initiated by school staff in 2020, 12(26%) compared to 36 (47%) and 38 (52%) in 2018 and 2019 respectively. In all years 75.9% of children were known to social care prior to CPME, and 94% of CPME concluded that there were significant safeguarding concerns. Conclusions School closure due to covid-19 may have harmed children as child abuse has remained hidden. There needs to be either mandatory attendance at schools in future or viable alternatives found. There may be a significant increase in safeguarding referrals when schools fully re-open as children disclose the abuse they have experienced at home.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joanna Garstang","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare Trust"},{"author_name":"Geoff Debelle","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Indu Anand","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jane Armstrong","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emily Botcher","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Helen Chaplin","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nutmeg Hallett","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Clare Morgans","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Price","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ern Ern Henna Tan","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emily Tudor","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Julie Taylor","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20168773","rel_title":"Challenges and proposed solutions in making clinical research on COVID-19 ethical.

However, we know little about the practical relevance of these challenges for Research Ethics Committees (RECs). Methods: We conducted a qualitative survey across all 52 German RECs on the challenges and potential solutions with reviewing proposals for COVID-19 studies. We de-identified the answers and applied thematic text analysis for the extraction and synthesis of challenges and potential solutions that we grouped under established principles for clinical research ethics. Results: We received an overall response rate of 42%. The 22 responding RECs reported that they had assessed a total of 441 study proposals on COVID-19 until 21 April 2020. For the review of these proposals the RECs indicated a broad spectrum of challenges regarding i) social value (e.g. lack of coordination), ii) scientific validity (e.g. provisional study planning), iii) favourable risk-benefit ratio (e.g. difficult benefit assessment), iv) informed consent (e.g. strict isolation measures), v) independent review (e.g. lack of time), vi) fair selection of trial participants (e.g. inclusion of vulnerable groups), and vii) respect for study participants (e.g. data security). Mentioned solutions ranged from improved local\/national coordination, over guidance on modified consent procedures, to priority setting across clinical studies. Conclusions: RECs are facing a broad spectrum of pressing challenges in reviewing COVID-19 studies. Some challenges for consent procedures are well known from research in intensive care settings but are further aggravated by infection measures. Other challenges such as reviewing several clinical studies at the same time that potentially compete for the recruitment of in-house COVID-19 patients are unique to the current situation. For some of the challenges the proposed solutions in our survey could relatively easy be translated into practice. Others need further conceptual and empirical research. Our findings together with the increasing body of literature on COVID-19 research ethics, and further stakeholder engagement should inform the development of hands-on guidance for researchers, funders, RECs, and further oversight bodies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alice Faust","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin \/ BIH Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Anna Sierawska","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin \/ BIH Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Katharina Krueger","author_inst":"Association of Medical Ethics Committees in Germany (AKEK, Arbeitskreis der Medizinischen Ethik-Kommissionen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland e.V.), Berlin"},{"author_name":"Anne Wisgalla","author_inst":"Association of Medical Ethics Committees in Germany (AKEK, Arbeitskreis der Medizinischen Ethik-Kommissionen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland e.V.), Berlin"},{"author_name":"Joerg Hasford","author_inst":"Association of Medical Ethics Committees in Germany (AKEK, Arbeitskreis der Medizinischen Ethik-Kommissionen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland e.V.), Berlin; In"},{"author_name":"Daniel Strech","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin \/ BIH Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Nutmeg Hallett","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Clare Morgans","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Price","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ern Ern Henna Tan","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emily Tudor","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Julie Taylor","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical ethics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.07.20170373","rel_title":"Protocol for a Rapid Scoping Review of Evidence of Outdoor Transmission of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.07.20170373","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic is both a global health crisis, and a civic emergency for national governments, including the UK.

Most histologic studies come from post-mortem analysis, with existing data indicating that histologic features of acute respiratory distress syndrome are typically present in fatal cases. However, this observation may be misleading, due to confounding factors in pre-terminal disease, including injury resulting from prolonged mechanical ventilation. Ante-mortem lung biopsy may provide major pathogenetic insights, potentially providing a basis for novel treatment approaches. AIM This comparative, multicenter, prospective, observational study was planned to identify ante-mortem histological profile and immunohistochemical features of lung tissue in patients with Covid-19 in early and late phases of the disease, including markers of inflammatory cells and major pathways involved in the cytokine storm triggering. METHODS Enrolled patients underwent lung biopsy, according to the study protocol approved by local Ethical Committee, either within 15 days of the first symptoms appearing (early phase) or after > 15 days (more advanced disease). Key exclusion criteria were excessive or uncorrectable bleeding risk and cardiovascular disease with heart failure. Lung samples were obtained by conventional trans-bronchialbiopsy, trans-bronchial lung cryobiopsy or surgical lung biopsy. RESULTS 23 patients were enrolled: 12 patients underwent lung biopsy within 15 days and 11 patients more than 15 days after the onset of symptoms. Early biopsies were characterized by spots of patchy acute lung injury (ALI) with alveolar type II cells hyperplasia and significant vascular abnormalities (disordered angiogenesis with alveolar capillary hyperplasia, luminal enlargement and thickened walls of pulmonary venules, perivascularCD4-T-cell infiltration), with no hyaline membranes. In the later stages, the alveolar architecture appeared disrupted, with areas of organizing ALI, venular congestion and capillary thromboembolic microangiopathy. Striking phenotypic features were demonstrated in hyper plastic pneumocytes and endothelial cells, including the expression of phospho-STAT3 and molecules involved in immunoinhibitory signals (PD-L1 and IDO1). Alveolar macrophages exhibited macrophage-related markers (CD68, CD11c, CD14) together with unusual markers, such as DC-Lamp\/CD208, CD206, CD123\/IL3AR. CONCLUSION A morphologically distinct Covid pattern was identified in the earlier stages of the disease, with prominent epithelial and endothelial cell abnormalities, that may be potentially reversible, differing strikingly from findings in classical diffuse alveolar damage. These observations may have major therapeutic implications, justifying studies of early interventions aimed at mitigating inflammatory organ injury.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio Doglioni","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, University Vita-Salute, Milan and San Raffaele Scientific Institute.

To describe the incidence, clinical course, and predictive factors of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection in a cohort of rheumatological patients residing in New Delhi (National Capital Region), India. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional, random telephonic survey from 20th April to 20th July 2020 on patients with rheumatic diseases. Patients were interviewed with a predesigned questionnaire. The incidence of COVID-19 in the general population was obtained from open access government data repository. Report of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction report was taken as confirmatory of COVID-19 infection. Results. Among the 900 contacted patients 840 responded (713 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 100 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 20 with spondylarthritis (SpA) and 7 with others; mean age 45 years, mean duration 11.3 years; 86% female). Among them 29 reported flu-like symptoms and four RA patients had confirmed COVID-19 infection. All of them were hospitalized with uneventful recovery. Rheumatological drugs were discontinued during the infectious episode. Disease modifying agents and biologics were equally received by those with or without COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was similar to general Delhi population (0.476% vs 0.519% respectively, p=0.86). Two patients had relapse of rheumatic disease after recovery. After recovery from COVID-19 or Flu-like illness, eight patients (27.6%, 95% confidence interval 14.7-45.7) reported disease flare. Conclusion. Patients with rheumatic diseases in India have similar incidence of COVID-19 infection compared to the community. Relapse of underlying rheumatic disease after recovery is not uncommon and continuation of glucocorticoid through the infection should be considered.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Uma Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rudra Prosad Goswami","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Danveer Bhadu","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Maumita Kanjilal","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Nagar","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Pallavi Vij","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Mittal","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Lakshman Meena","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Debaditya Roy","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Stefano Maitan","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, G.B.

Several infection control strategies have been implemented. Particularly, evidence shows that universal masking can mitigate COVID-19 infection, though existing research is limited by secular trend bias. Aims: To investigate the effect of hospital universal masking on COVID-19 incidence among HCWs compared to the general community population. Methods: We compared the 7-day averaged incidence rates between a Massachusetts (USA) healthcare system and Massachusetts residents statewide. The study period was from March 17 (the date of first incident case in the healthcare system) to May 6 (the date Massachusetts implemented public masking). The healthcare system implemented universal masking on March 26, we allotted a 5-day lag for effect onset, and peak COVID-19 incidence in Massachusetts was April 20. Thus, we categorized March 17-31 as the pre-intervention phase, April 1-20 the intervention phase, and April 21-May 6 the post-intervention phase. Temporal incidence trends (i.e. 7-day average slopes) were compared using standardized coefficients from linear regression models. Results: The standardized coefficients were similar between the healthcare system and the state in both the pre- and post-intervention phases. During the intervention phase, the healthcare system's epidemic slope became negative (standardized {beta}: -0.68, 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.31), while Massachusetts' slope remained positive (standardized {beta}: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.05). Conclusions: Universal masking at the healthcare system was associated with flattening the COVID-19 curve among HCWs, while the infection rate continued to rise in the surrounding community.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan-Yun Lan","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, Harvard University T.H.

The rapid spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has caused devastating health and economic crises all over the world, with Spain being one of the worst affected countries in terms of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths per inhabitant. In this situation, the Spanish Government declared the lockdown of the country with the aim of flattening the epidemic curve. The variations of air pollution in terms of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in 8 cities of Spain are analyzed here considering the effect of meteorology during the COVID-19 lockdown period (from March 15th to April 12th 2020). The results of the analysis show that the 4-week Spanish lockdown was not long enough to reduce the PM2.5 levels in all the cities considered. These reductions were less than those expected, despite the drastically reduced human activity. Furthermore, no associations between COVID-19 accumulated cases and PM2.5 exposure or environmental conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, sunlight hours, maximum pressure) were found during the early spread of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alvaro Briz-Redon","author_inst":"City Council of Valencia"},{"author_name":"Carolina Belenguer-Sapina","author_inst":"University of Valencia"},{"author_name":"Angel Serrano-Aroca","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Valencia San Vicente Martir"},{"author_name":"Eirini Iliaki","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Medicine, Cambridge Health Alliance, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lou Ann Bruno-Murtha","author_inst":"Infection Prevention & Infectious Diseases, Cambridge Health Alliance, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Assaad J.

Based on these data GS-CHO pools stably producing spike trimer under the control of a strong synthetic promoter were cultured in hypothermic conditions with combinations of bioactive small molecules to increase yield of purified spike product 4.9-fold to 53 mg\/L. Purification of recombinant spike by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography initially yielded a variety of co-eluting protein impurities identified as host cell-derived by mass spectrometry, which were separated from spike trimer using a modified imidazole gradient elution. Purified CHO spike trimer antigen was used in ELISA format to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in sera from patient cohorts previously tested for viral infection by PCR, including those who had displayed COVID-19 symptoms. The antibody assay, validated to ISO 15189 Medical Laboratories standards, exhibited a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 92.3%.

Valves allow material release, but we theorised that valve design may direct material downwards towards patient and surrounding environment. Limiting transmission of diseases with aerosolised spread is a current and serious concern within healthcare worldwide. Filtering face piece masks (FFP) are an essential piece of protective equipment when treating patients with ongoing infection. However, valved masks in other settings such as elective theatre and by the general public may have unforeseen negative effects. Methods: A heating coil-based vaporiser was used to produce visible water vapour. A healthy test subject was then filmed wearing a variety of different masks and exhaling the water vapour. Results: Flexible pleated and solid-shell FFP masks direct exhaled material downwards in plumes exceeding 25 cm. Duckbill-shaped masks appear to direct exhaled vapour laterally, with a smaller plume. The effect is influenced by mask design and type of valve. Fluid repellent surgical masks reduce material directed downwards, and when used in conjunction with an FFP3 mask, appear to reduce the size and density of the exhaled vapour plume. The use of a visor was ineffective in reducing plume expulsion. Conclusion: A properly fit-tested FFP3-rated protective mask may only moderately limit expulsion of aerosolised particles from asymptomatic healthcare workers to patients, particularly in cases where procedures are being performed in close proximity to patients or in cases where mucosal surfaces are exposed. Further research in this area is needed.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Stubington","author_inst":"Royal Derby Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raguwinder Sahota","author_inst":"Royal Derby Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nima Mottacki","author_inst":"Sahlgrenska Academy University of Gothenberg Institute of medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Johnston","author_inst":"Royal Derby Hospital"},{"author_name":"Owen Judd","author_inst":"Royal Derby Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thilo H Pohle","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Sheetal Maisuria","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amina Bhayat-Cammack","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, U.K."},{"author_name":"Adam J Brown","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Kang Lan Tee","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Philip J Jackson","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Tuck Seng Wong","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Mark J Dickman","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Ravishankar Sargur","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, U.K."},{"author_name":"David C James","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Luca Donati","author_inst":"Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

Most current tests for SARS-CoV-2 are based on RNA extraction followed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assays. While automation and improved logistics increased the capacity of these tests, they cannot exceed the lower bound dictated by one extraction and one RT-PCR reaction per sample. Multiplexed next generation sequencing (NGS) assays provide a dramatic increase in throughput, and hold the promise of richer information including viral strains, host immune response, and multiple pathogens. Here, we establish a significant improvement of existing RNA-seq detection protocols. Our workflow, ApharSeq, includes a fast and cheap RNA capture step, that is coupled to barcoding of individual samples, followed by sample-pooling prior to the reverse transcription, PCR and massively parallel sequencing. Thus, only one non-enzymatic step is performed before pooling hundreds of barcoded samples for subsequent steps and further analysis. We characterize the quantitative aspects of the assay by applying ApharSeq to more than 500 clinical samples in a robotic workflow. The assay results are linear, and the empirical limit of detection is found to be Ct 33 (roughly 1000 copies\/ml). A single ApharSeq test currently costs under 1.2$, and we estimate costs can further go down 3-10 fold. Similarly, we estimate a labor reduction of 10-100 fold, automated liquid handling of 5-10 fold, and reagent requirement reduction of 20-1000 fold compared to existing testing methods.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alon Chappleboim","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Daphna Joseph-Strauss","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Ayelet Rahat","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Israa Sharkia","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Miriam Adam","author_inst":"Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, H"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kitsberg","author_inst":"Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, H"},{"author_name":"Gavriel Fialkoff","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Matan Lotem","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Omer Gershon","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Anna-Kristina Schmidtner","author_inst":"Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, H"},{"author_name":"Esther Oiknine-Djian","author_inst":"Hadassah - Hebrew University Medical Centre, Jerusalem 9112001, Israel; The Lautenberg Centre for Immunology and Cancer Research, IMRIC, Faculty of Medicine, Th"},{"author_name":"Agnes Klochendler","author_inst":"Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer Research, IMRIC, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9112001, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ronen Sadeh","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer Research, IMRIC, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9112001, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dana Wolf","author_inst":"Hadassah - Hebrew University Medical Centre, Jerusalem 9112001, Israel; The Lautenberg Centre for Immunology and Cancer Research, IMRIC, Faculty of Medicine, Th"},{"author_name":"Naomi Habib","author_inst":"Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, H"},{"author_name":"Nir Friedman","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Carmela Grosso","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, GB Morgagni Hospital.

The risk of mortality was higher in patients with increasing age, male gender (RR 1.45; 95%CI 1.23,1.71), dyspnea (RR 2.55; 95%CI 1.88,2.46), diabetes (RR 1.59; 95%CI 1.41,1.78), hypertension (RR 1.90; 95%CI 1.69,2.15). Congestive heart failure (OR 4.76; 95%CI 1.34,16.97), hilar lymphadenopathy (OR 8.34; 95%CI 2.57,27.08), bilateral lung involvement (OR 4.86; 95%CI 3.19,7.39) and reticular pattern (OR 5.54; 95%CI 1.24,24.67) were associated with severe disease. Clinically relevant cut-offs for leukocytosis(>10.0 x109\/L), lymphopenia(< 1.1 x109\/L), elevated C-reactive protein(>100mg\/L), LDH(>250U\/L) and D-dimer(>1mg\/L) had higher odds of severe disease and greater risk of mortality. Conclusion: Knowledge of the factors associated of disease severity and mortality identified in our study may assist in clinical decision-making and critical-care resource allocation for patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vignesh Chidambaram","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg school of Public health"},{"author_name":"Nyan Lynn Tun","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Waqas Haque","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Marie Gilbert Majella","author_inst":"Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, India"},{"author_name":"Ranjith Kumar Sivakumar","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Amudha Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA"},{"author_name":"Angela Ting-Wei Hsu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Izza Ishak","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aqsha Nur","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Samuel Ayeh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emmanuella Salia","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ahsan Zil-E-Ali","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Saeed","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Ayu Sarena","author_inst":"Bhayangkara Setukpa Hospital, Sukabumi, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Bhavna Seth","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Muzzammil Ahmadzada","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Eman Haque","author_inst":"Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

The problem is not only that they are difficult to identify and test, but also that it is believed that they may constitute the bulk of the cases and could be crucial in the pandemic equation. We present a novel and simple algorithm to extract the number of these mild cases by correlating a COVID-line phone calls to reported cases in given districts. The key assumption is to realize that, being a highly contagious disease, the number of calls by mild cases should be proportional to the number of reported cases. Whereas a background of calls not related to infected people should be proportional to the district population. We present the plain mathematics of the method and as a working example we apply it to Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), where it is being currently used. The implementation of this algorithm by other regions would be straightforward and would provide compelling information to the corresponding Health Care Administration.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ezequiel Alvarez","author_inst":"University of San Martin"},{"author_name":"Franco Marsico","author_inst":"Ministerio de Salud de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Waqas Haque","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Marie Gilbert Majella","author_inst":"Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, India"},{"author_name":"Ranjith Kumar Sivakumar","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Amudha Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA"},{"author_name":"Angela Ting-Wei Hsu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Izza Ishak","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aqsha Nur","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Samuel Ayeh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emmanuella Salia","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ahsan Zil-E-Ali","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Saeed","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Ayu Sarena","author_inst":"Bhayangkara Setukpa Hospital, Sukabumi, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Bhavna Seth","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Muzzammil Ahmadzada","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Eman Haque","author_inst":"Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

Here we characterize transmission risk between 1,178 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and their 15,648 close contacts based on detailed contact tracing data from Hunan, China. We find that 80% of secondary transmissions can be traced back to 14% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, indicating substantial transmission heterogeneities. Regression analysis suggests a marked gradient of transmission risk scales positively with the duration of exposure and the closeness of social interactions, after adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. Population-level physical distancing measures confine transmission to families and households; while case isolation and contact quarantine reduce transmission in all settings. Adjusted for interventions, the reconstructed infectiousness profile of a typical SARS-CoV-2 infection peaks just before symptom presentation, with ~50% of transmission occurring in the pre-symptomatic phase. Modelling results indicate that achieving SARS-CoV-2 control would require the synergistic efforts of case isolation, contact quarantine, and population-level physical distancing measures, owing to the particular transmission kinetics of this virus.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lidong Gao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiwei Luo","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Lingshuang Ren","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhifei Zhan","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Huang","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Qianlai Sun","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Liu","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA; ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

During this period, web interest in the novel coronavirus has undergone a drastic surge. Objective: The aim of this study was to quantitatively analyze the impact of COVID-19 on Web searches related to hygiene-preventive measures and emotional-psychological aspects as well as to estimate the effectiveness and limits of online information during an epidemic. We looked for significant correlations between COVID-19 relative search volumes and cases per region to understand the interest of the average Italian Web user during international, national, and regional COVID-19 situations. By doing so, from the analysis of Web searches, it will be possible to deduce the mental and physical health of the population. Methods: To conduct this research, we used the \"Google Trends\" tool, which returns normalized values, called \"relative search volumes\" (RSVs), ranging from 0 to 100 according to the Web popularity of a group of queries. By comparing the RSVs in periods before and after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Italy, we derived the impact of COVID-19 on the activity of Italian netizens towards novel coronavirus itself, specifically regarding hygiene, prevention, and psychological well-being. Furthermore, we calculated Pearson's correlations {rho} ; between all these queries and COVID-19 cases for each region. We chose a p-value (p) threshold =.1. Results: After the two initial spikes that occurred on February 23 and March 9, 2020, the general web interest in COVID-19 in Italy waned, as did the correlation with the official number of cases per region (p< .1 only until March 14, 2020). However, web interest was similarly distributed across the regions (ASV=92,SD=6). We also found that all trends depend significantly on the number of COVID-19 cases at national but not international or regional levels. Between February 20 and June 10, 2020, web interest relating to hygiene and prevention increased by 116% and 901%, respectively, compared to those from January 1 to February 19, 2020 (95% CIs: [115.3,116.3],[850.3,952,2]). Significant correlations between regional cumulative web searches and COVID-19 cases were found only between February 26 and March 7, 2020 ({rho}-best= .43, 95% CI:[.42.44],p= .07). During the COVID-19 pandemic until June 10, 2020, national web searches of the generic terms \"fear\" and \"anxiety\" grew by 8% and 21%, respectively (95% CIs: [8.0,8.2],[20.4,20.6]) compared to those of the period January 1, 2018 - December 29, 2019. We found cyclically significant correlations between negative emotions related to the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 official data. Conclusions: Italian netizens showed a marked interest in the COVID-19 pandemic only when this became a direct national problem. In general, web searches have rarely been correlated with the number of cases per region; we conclude that the danger, once it arrived in the country, was perceived similarly in all regions. We can state that the period of maximum effectiveness of online information, in relation to this type of situation, is limited to 3-4 days from a specific key event. If such a scenario were to occur again, we suggest that all government agencies focus their web disclosure efforts over that time. Despite this, we found cyclical correlations with web searches related to negative feelings such as anxiety, depression, fear, and stress. Therefore, to identify mental and physical health problems among the population, it suffices to observe slight variations in the trend of related web queries.

Mortality indicators are among the most salient measures of the impact of COVID-19. While demographers favor age-standardized death rates to track the pandemic, those are expressed in unintuitive metrics: deaths per 1,000 or fraction thereof. Declines in life expectancies provide more intuitive indicators of the impact of COVID-19 on the individual lifespan. Derived under the assumption that future mortality conditions will indefinitely repeat those observed during a reference period, however, life expectancies intuitive interpretation becomes problematic when that reference period is only a temporary phase in the diffusion of an epidemic. To avoid making any assumption about future mortality, I propose measuring instead the Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL), defined as the average difference between the actual and otherwise expected ages at death in an actual death cohort. For fine-grained tracking of the pandemic, I also provide an empirical shortcut to MUL estimation for small areas or short periods. I estimate quarterly MUL values for the first half of 2020 in 144 national populations and 122 sub-national populations in Italy, Mexico, Spain and the US. Across national populations, the highest quarterly values were reached in the second quarter in Peru (3.90 years) and in Ecuador (4.59 years). Higher quarterly values still were found in New York and New Jersey, where individuals died respectively 5.41 and 5.56 years younger on average than their expected age at death. Using a shorter, seven-day rolling window, I estimate the MUL peaked at 7.32 years in Lombardy, 8.96 years in Madrid, and 8.93 years in New York, and even reached 12.86 years for the entire month of April in Guayas (Ecuador). These results illustrate how the MUL provides an intuitive metric to track the pandemic without requiring assumptions about future mortality.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Heuveline","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ravi Kumar Arya","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Animesh Animesh","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ravi Dugh","author_inst":"The University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Zuber Khan","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lingshuang Ren","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhifei Zhan","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Huang","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Qianlai Sun","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Liu","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA; ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

In previous studies and reports from the UK and US evidence emerged that poverty related indicators had a significant statistical effect on case and mortality rates on district level. For Germany, it has largely been assumed that poverty is an equally relevant factor influencing the transmission rates of the outbreak mostly due to anecdotal evidence from local outbreaks in meat processing plants and reported incidents in poorer city districts. This paper addresses the lack of statistical evidence and investigates thoroughly the link between poverty related indicators and case and mortality rates of the outbreak using multivariate, multilevel regression while also considering the urban-rural divide of the country. As proxies for poverty the unemployment rate, the per capita presence of general practitioners (physicians), per capita GDP, and the rate of employees with no professional job training is evaluated in relation to the accumulated case and mortality numbers on district level taken from RKI data of June and July 2020. Interestingly, the study finds no evidence for a poverty-related effect on mortality for German districts. Furthermore, only employment in low qualification jobs approximated by the job training variable consistently affected case numbers in urban districts in the expected direction.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felix Ettensperger","author_inst":"Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Ravi Kumar Arya","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Animesh Animesh","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ravi Dugh","author_inst":"The University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Zuber Khan","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lingshuang Ren","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhifei Zhan","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Huang","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Qianlai Sun","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Liu","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA; ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

Methods A multivariate model for the log10 of viral reproductive rate was constructed for each country using lockdown stringency (Oxford University tracker), temperature and humidity, for the 1st 110 days of 2020. This was validated by extrapolating to the following 51 days, and comparing the predicted viral rate and cumulative mortality with WHO data. The country models was extrapolated to July 2021 using projected weather forecast for four scenarios; continuing with the 11\/6\/2020 lockdown policy, 100% lockdown, 20% lockdown and no lockdown. Results From pooled data (40 countries), lockdown stringency had a strong negative correlation with log10viral reproductive rate (-0.648 at 21 days later). Maximum temperature correlated at -0.14, 14 days later and humidity correlated at +0.25, 22 days later. Predictive Models were generated for 11 countries using multivariate regression of these parameters. The R2 correlation for log10R0 ranged from 0.817 to 0.987 for the model generation period. For the validation period, the Pearson's coefficient of correlation for log10R0 ranged from 0.344 to 0.984 and for cumulative mortality from 0.980 to 1.000. Forward extrapolation of these models for 5 nations, demonstrate, that removing the lockdown will result in rapid spread of the disease ranging from as soon as July 2020 for Russia, UK, Italy and India to January 2021 for the USA. The current (11\/6\/20) lockdown in the USA, Spain, UK, France, Germany, Turkey can control the disease but other nations will need to intensify their lockdowns to prevent future resurgence. Most nations will require more stringent lockdowns in January than in July. Conclusion The viral reproductive rate is highly predicted by a combination of lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity. Country specific predictive models can provide useful forecast of policy requirements.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David SJ Ellis","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminister NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Dimitris I Papadopoulos","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ivo Donkov","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminister NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Samuel Bishara","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminister NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Zuber Khan","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lingshuang Ren","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhifei Zhan","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Huang","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Qianlai Sun","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Liu","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA; ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

While studies analyzing humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 were available rather early during the pandemic, cellular immunity came into focus of investigations just recently. For the present work, we have adapted a protocol, designed for the detection of rare neoantigen-specific Memory T cells in cancer patients for studying cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Both, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected after 6 days of in vitro expansion using overlapping peptide libraries representing the whole viral protein. The assay readout was an Intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometric analysis detecting four functional markers simultaneously (CD154, TNF, IL-2, IFN-{gamma}). We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 9 of 9 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. All patients had reactive T cells against at least one of 12 analyzed viral antigens and all patients had Spike-specific T cells. While some antigens were detected by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Membrane protein was mainly recognized by CD4+ T cells. Strikingly, we were not able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 9 unexposed healthy individuals. We are presenting a highly specific protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells. Our data confirmed the important role of cellular immune responses in understanding SARS-CoV-2 clearance. We showed that Spike is the most immunogenic antigen. We have introduced Membrane protein as interesting target for studying humoral immune responses in convalescent COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Henning Zelba","author_inst":"CeGaT GmbH"},{"author_name":"David Worbs","author_inst":"CeGaT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Johannes Harter","author_inst":"CeGaT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Natalia Pieper","author_inst":"CeGaT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christina Kyzirakos-Feger","author_inst":"Praxis fuer Humangenetik"},{"author_name":"Simone Kayser","author_inst":"Praxis fuer Humangenetik"},{"author_name":"Marcel Seibold","author_inst":"Praxis fuer Humangenetik"},{"author_name":"Oliver Bartsch","author_inst":"Praxis fuer Humangenetik"},{"author_name":"Jiri Koedding","author_inst":"CeGaT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Saskia Biskup","author_inst":"Praxis fuer Humangenetik"},{"author_name":"Qianlai Sun","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Liu","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA; ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

While COVID-19 severe forms share clinical and laboratory aspects with various pathologies such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, sepsis or cytokine release syndrome, their exact nature remains unknown. This is severely impeding the ability to treat patients facing severe stages of the disease. To this aim, we performed an in-depth, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of more than 150.000 immune cells isolated from matched blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, and integrated it with clinical, immunological and functional ex vivo data. We unveiled an immune signature of disease severity that correlated with the accumulation of naive lymphoid cells in the lung and an expansion and activation of myeloid cells in the periphery. Moreover, we demonstrated that myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution and arginase 1 expression is significantly associated with monocyte immune regulatory features. Noteworthy, we found monocyte and neutrophil immune suppression loss associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe pa-tients. Additionally, our analysis discovered that the strongest association of the patients clinical outcome and immune phenotype is the lung T cell response. We found that patients with a robust CXCR6+ effector memory T cell response have better outcomes. This result is line with the rs11385942 COVID-19 risk allel, which is in proximity to the CXCR6 gene and suggest effector memory T cell are a primary feature in COVID-19 patients. By systemically quantifying the viral landscape in the lung of severe patients, we indeed identified Herpes-Simplex-Virus 1 (HSV-1) as a potential opportunistic virus in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, we observed an unexpectedly high SARS-CoV-2 viral load in an immuno-compromised patient, allowing us to study the SARS-CoV-2 in-vivo life cycle. The development of myeloid dysfunctions and the impairment of lymphoid arm establish a condition of immune paralysis that supports secondary bacteria and virus infection and can progress to immune silence in patients facing death.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pierre Bost","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, Systems Biology Group, Department of Computational Biology and USR 3756, Institut Past"},{"author_name":"Francesco De Sanctis","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefania Cane","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ugel","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Katia Donadello","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Department of Surgery, Dentistry, Maternity and Infant, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Monica Castellucci","author_inst":"The Center for Technological Platforms, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"David Eyal","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Fiore","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Anselmi","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roza Maria Barouni","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rosalinda Trovato","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Caligola","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessia Lamolinara","author_inst":"CAST- Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

Objectives: We created a Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) to support counties and municipalities by integrating baseline data on relevant community vulnerabilities with dynamic data on local infection rates and interventions. The PVI visually synthesizes county-level vulnerability indicators, enabling their comparison in regional, state, and nationwide contexts. Methods: We describe the data streams used and how these are combined to calculate the PVI, detail the supporting epidemiological modeling and machine-learning forecasts, and outline the deployment of an interactive web Dashboard. Finally, we describe the practical application of the PVI for real-world decision-making. Results: Considering an outlook horizon from 1 to 28 days, the overall PVI scores are significantly associated with key vulnerability-related outcome metrics of cumulative deaths, population adjusted cumulative deaths, and the proportion of deaths from cases. The modeling results indicate the most significant predictors of case counts are population size, proportion of black residents, and mean PM2.5. The machine learning forecast results were strongly predictive of observed cases and deaths up to 14 days ahead. The modeling reinforces an integrated concept of vulnerability that accounts for both dynamic and static data streams and highlights the drivers of inequities in COVID-19 cases and deaths. These results also indicate that local areas with a highly ranked PVI should take near-term action to mitigate vulnerability. Discussion: The COVID-19 PVI Dashboard monitors multiple data streams to communicate county-level trends and vulnerabilities and facilitates decision-making and communication among government officials, scientists, community leaders, and the public to enable effective and coordinated action to combat the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Skylar W Marvel","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"John S House","author_inst":"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Matthew Wheeler","author_inst":"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kuncheng Song","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Yihui Zhou","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Fred A Wright","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Weihsueh A Chiu","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Ivan Rusyn","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Alison Motsinger-Reif","author_inst":"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"David M Reif","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Rosalinda Trovato","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Caligola","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessia Lamolinara","author_inst":"CAST- Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

Since then, the viral genome has shown considerable variance as the disease spread across the world, in part due to the zoonotic origins of the virus and the human host adaptation process. As a virus with an RNA genome that codes for its own genomic replication proteins, mutations in these proteins can significantly impact the variance rate of the genome, affecting both the survival and infection rate of the virus, and attempts at combating the disease. In this study, we analyzed the mutation densities of viral isolates carrying frequently observed mutations for four proteins in the RNA synthesis complex over time in comparison to wildtype isolates. Our observations suggest mutations in nsp14, an error-correcting exonuclease protein, have the strongest association with increased mutation load in both regions without selective pressure and across the genome, compared to nsp7, 8, and 12, which form the core polymerase complex. We propose nsp14 as a priority research target for understanding genomic variance rate in SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and nsp14 mutations as potential predictors for high mutability strains.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Do\u011fa Eskier","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG), Izmir, Turkey; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Asl\u0131 Suner","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Yavuz Oktay","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG), Izmir, Turkey; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey; Departmen"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6khan Karak\u00fclah","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG), Izmir, Turkey; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Edith Cowan University"},{"author_name":"Qun Meng","author_inst":"Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Youxin Wang","author_inst":"Capital medical university"},{"author_name":"Ivan Rusyn","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Alison Motsinger-Reif","author_inst":"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"David M Reif","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Rosalinda Trovato","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Caligola","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessia Lamolinara","author_inst":"CAST- Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

The screen identified 4 FDA-approved small molecules, Maraviroc, FTY720 (Fingolimod), Atorvastatin and Nitazoxanide that were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Confocal microscopy with over expressed S protein demonstrated that Maraviroc reduced the extent of S-protein mediated cell fusion as observed by fewer multinucleate cells in drug-treated cells. Mathematical modeling of drug-dependent viral multiplication dynamics revealed that prolonged drug treatment will exert an exponential decrease in viral load in a multicellular\/tissue environment.

The resulting {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu virus can be generated by reverse genetics and grown to high titers in cell culture. A single-dose intranasal inoculation of mice with {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu elicits serum neutralizing antibody titers against SAR-CoV-2 comparable to those observed in humans following natural infection ([~]1:200). Furthermore, {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu itself causes no apparent disease in mice.

We report a conformation in which the trimer is  locked into a compact well-ordered form. This differs from previous structures where the RBD can flip up to recognise the receptor. In the  locked form regions associated with fusion transitions are stabilised and the RBD harbours curved lipids. The acyl chains bind a hydrophobic pocket in one RBD whilst the polar headgroups attach to an adjacent RBD of the trimer. By functional analogy with enteroviral pocket factors loss of the lipid would destabilise the  locked form facilitating receptor attachment, conversion to the postfusion state and virus infection. The nature of lipids available at the site of infection might affect the antigenicity\/pathogenicity of released virus.
