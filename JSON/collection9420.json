As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number Ro -- the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of Ro vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate $r$, the mean generation interval $\\bar G$, and the generation-interval dispersion $\\kappa$. We then apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early Ro estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of Ro, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate Ro at the outset of an epidemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sang Woo Park","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin M.

Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV in the early stage of epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively. The latest estimates of the cCFR were 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.6) for scenario 1 and 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3%) for scenario 2, respectively. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.3) and 3.7 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.3) for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively.

Methods: The information of COVID-19 and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 853 confirmed COVID-19 patients obtained from the website of health committees of 18 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the COVID-19 epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed COVID-19 case data. Results: The growth rate of new cases and deaths of COVID-19 were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 853 confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 1 months to 94 years and the average age was (45.05 {+\/-} 17.22) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.12: 1. Conclusions: The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher. The age of COVID-19 patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (60.61%). The harm of the first-generation COVID-19 patients is higher than that of secondary cases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongqiang Zhang","author_inst":"Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fengying Li","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Xianyang"},{"author_name":"Bei Zhang","author_inst":"Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qiling Liu","author_inst":"Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiangwen Li","author_inst":"Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Limei Luo","author_inst":"Shangdong Provincial Maternity and Childcare Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ryo Kinoshita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Nishiura","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.31.928796","rel_title":"Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool for rapid identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes","rel_date":"2020-02-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.31.928796","rel_abs":"SummaryGenome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Ram Beck","author_inst":"Deargen Inc., Daejeon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Bonggun Shin","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States"},{"author_name":"Yoonjung Choi","author_inst":"Deargen, Inc., Daejeon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Sungsoo Park","author_inst":"Deargen, Inc., Daejeon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Keunsoo Kang","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Luiz C.

DUBs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. Commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the C-terminal Ub motif or contain Ub coupled to a fluorophore (Z-LRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. By using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) and a defined P2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two DUBs--MERS PLpro and human UCH-L3. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized Ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (ABPs) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the C-terminal Ub motif. Biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates and probes. Using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes Ub and Ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wioletta Rut","author_inst":"Department of Chemical Biology and Bioimaging, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Wyb.

Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed.

This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45\/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arunachalam Ramaiah","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Riley O.

As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.\n\nMethodsWe downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.\n\nResultsAn isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1{middle dot}05 x 10-2 (nucleotide substitutions\/site\/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 x 10-4 to 2.72 x 10-2) for N, 5.34 x 10-3 (5.10 x 10-4, 1.28 x 10-2) for S, 1.69 x 10-3 (3.94 x 10-4, 3.60 x 10-3) for P, 1.65 x 10-3 (4.47 x 10-4, 3.24 x 10-3) for the whole genome, respectively.

We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to \"Disease X\" (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%. Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen.

We found that epidemic week and viral serial interval were correlated with the speed with which populations developed and maintained health behaviors in each outbreak.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Evans K Lodge","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Annakate M Schatz","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"John M Drake","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Katsuma Hayashi","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Natalie M.

Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaolong Tian","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Li","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ailing Huang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shuai Xia","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Sicong Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhengli Shi","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenlin Yang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yanling Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tianlei Ying","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Huji Xu","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.28.923169","rel_title":"Beware of asymptomatic transmission: Study on 2019-nCoV prevention and control measures based on extended SEIR model","rel_date":"2020-01-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.28.923169","rel_abs":"BackgroundThe 2019 new coronavirus, \"2019-nCoV\", was discovered from Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases in December 2019, and was named by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020.

Specifically, in the 5-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.\n\nConclusionsThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.

However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear.\n\nObjectivesWe aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS.\n\nMethodsData on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS.\n\nMeasurements and main resultsAs of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic.\n\nConclusionsNCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective.

The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As a novel virus, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP remain unclear, and it is also important to compare it with SARS.\n\nWhat This Study Adds to the FieldWe compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS, and found that NCP has a higher transmissibility than SARS. Time-varying production number indicates that rigorous control measures taken by governments are effective across China, and persistent efforts are needed to be taken for reducing instantaneous reproduction number below one.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiong Hu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianpeng Xiao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guanhao He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min Kang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zuhua Rong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Haojie Zhong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qiong Huang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Aiping Deng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Weilin Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Tan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Siqing Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Zhu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jiansen Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Dexin Gong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Donghua Wan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shaowei Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lingchuan Guo","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Limei Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"systems biology"}]}
