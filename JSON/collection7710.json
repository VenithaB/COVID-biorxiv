Knowledge, attitude, and practice survey provides a suitable format to evaluate existing programs and to identify effective strategies for behavior change in society. Therefore, the aim of study is to assess knowledge, attitude and practice among HCPs in Pakistan regarding COVID-19. An online survey-based study was conducted among healthcare professionals including physicians, pharmacists and nurses. A self-administered validated (Cronbach alpha=0.077) questionnaire comprised of five sections (Demographics, Knowledge, attitude, practice and perceived barriers) were used for data collection. Of 414 participants, 29.98% (n=120) physicians, 46.65% (n= 189) pharmacists and 25.36% (n= 105%) nurses. Most commonly utilized information source was social media. Findings showed HCPs have good knowledge (93.2%, n=386), positive attitude (Mean 8.43, SD:1.78) and good practice (88.7%, n=367) regarding COVID-19. HCPs perceived that overcrowding in emergency room (52.9%, n=219), limited infection control material (50.7%, n=210) and poor knowledge regarding transmission (40.6%, n=168) of COVID-19 are the major barriers in infection control practice. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that HCPs of age group 40-49 years (OR: 1.419, 95%CI: (0.14-4.78, P=0.041) have higher odds of good knowledge. Similarly, age group of 31-39 years (OR: 1.377, 95% CI: 0.14-2.04, P=0.05), experience of more than 5 years (OR: 10.71, 95% CI: 2.83-40.75, P<0.001), and pharmacist job (OR: 2.247, 95% CI: 1.11-4.55, P=0.025) were the substantial determinants of good practice regarding COVID-19. HCPs in Pakistan have good knowledge, yet, there are areas where gaps in knowledge and practice was observed. To effectively control infection spread, well-structured training programs must be launched by government targeting all kinds of HCPs to raise their existed knowledge.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Saqlain","author_inst":"Quaid-I-Azam University, Islamabad"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Muddasir Munir","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Saif Ur Rehman","author_inst":"College of Physician and Surgeons, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Aqsa Gulzar","author_inst":"Lahore College for Women University, Lahore."},{"author_name":"Sahar Naz","author_inst":"The University of Faisalabad, Faisalabad"},{"author_name":"Zaheer Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Sargodha, Sargodha"},{"author_name":"Azhar Hussain Tahir","author_inst":"Quaid-I-Azam University, Islamabad"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Mashhood","author_inst":"Government College University, Faisalabad"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Foc\u00e0","author_inst":"University Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arnaldo Caruso","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Neurology, Public Health, Disability Unit - IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Pia Pasolini","author_inst":"Neurophysiology Unit, ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Gasparotti","author_inst":"Euroradiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Castelli","author_inst":"University Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Ashton","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20062810","rel_title":"Is the fit of N95 facial masks effected by disinfection?

Moreover, this work has influenced policy makers at the highest levels of the United States government, having been mentioned at White House Press conferences, including March 31, 2020. In this paper, we evaluate the predictive validity of model forecasts for COVID19 outcomes as data become sequentially available, using the IHME prediction of daily deaths. We have found that the predictions for daily number of deaths provided by the IHME model have been highly inaccurate. The model has been found to perform poorly even when attempting to predict the number of next day deaths. In particular, the true number of next day deaths has been outside the IHME prediction intervals as much as 70% of the time.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roman Marchant","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Noelle I Samia","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Ori Rosen","author_inst":"University of Texas at El Paso"},{"author_name":"Martin A Tanner","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Sally Cripps","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Haotian Wang","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc"},{"author_name":"Mervin Zhao","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc"},{"author_name":"Qiqi Wang","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc"},{"author_name":"Steven Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Larry F Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Neurology, Public Health, Disability Unit - IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Pia Pasolini","author_inst":"Neurophysiology Unit, ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Gasparotti","author_inst":"Euroradiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Castelli","author_inst":"University Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Ashton","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063560","rel_title":"Knowledge and practices towards COVID-19 during its outbreak: a multinational cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063560","rel_abs":"Background: The emergence of COVID-19 globally coupled with its unknown aetiology and its high transmission rate has created an unprecedented state of emergency worldwide. Public knowledge and awareness about COVID-19 are essential in suppressing its pandemic status. Method: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted between 19th of March and 6th of April 2020 in three Middle Eastern countries (Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) to explore the knowledge and practices of Middle Eastern population towards COVID-19. A previously developed questionnaire was used. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 knowledge. Results: A total of 1,208 participants were involved in this study from the three countries (Jordan = 389, Saudi Arabia = 433, and Kuwait = 386). The majority of participants (n = 810, 67.2%) were females and aged 30 to 49 years (n = 501, 41.5%). Participants had moderate overall COVID-19 knowledge with a mean score of 7.93 (SD = 1.72) out of 12, 66.1%. Participants had better knowledge about disease prevention and control with 83.0%, whereas the lowest sub-scale scores were for questions about disease transmission routes (43.3%). High education level was an important predictor of greater COVID-19 knowledge scores (p<0.01). Conclusion: Middle Eastern participants are of a relatively low level of knowledge about COVID-19, particularly regarding its transmission routes. Policymakers are recommended to develop informative COVID-19 related campaigns targeted specifically towards university students, unemployed individuals and those with lower levels of education.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdallah Y Naser","author_inst":"Isra University"},{"author_name":"Eman Zmaily Dahmash","author_inst":"Isra University"},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Umm Alqura University"},{"author_name":"Zahra Khalil Alsairafi","author_inst":"Kuwait University"},{"author_name":"Ahmed M.

We find that variations in the time dimension and intensity of various strategies can have vastly different performance outcomes: (i) the timing of NPIs can 'shrink the area under the curve' (cumulative infections) not just 'flatten the curve'; (ii) prolonged lockdowns have diminishing margins of returns; (iii) smooth, submaximal lockdowns perform better than pulsatile lockdowns; and (iv) the efficiency of various strategies incorporating both epidemiological and non-epidemiological outcomes vary substantially. Most sobering, none of the simulated strategies allow for an 'acceptable' path to exit within six months due to very large gaps in health system capacity.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Aun Yap","author_inst":"Quanticlear Solutions"},{"author_name":"Dhesi Baha Raja","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Umm Alqura University"},{"author_name":"Zahra Khalil Alsairafi","author_inst":"Kuwait University"},{"author_name":"Ahmed M.

The high prevalence and associated healthcare, social and economic challenges of COVID-19 suggest this pandemic is likely to have a major impact on cancer management, and has been shown to potentially have worse outcomes in this cohort of vulnerable patients (1). This study aims to compare the outcomes of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 positive disease in patients with or without a history of cancer. Method: We retrospectively collected clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 RT-PCR positive cancer patients treated consecutively in four different North London hospitals (cohort A). Outcomes recorded included morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. All clinically relevant outcomes were then compared to consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients, without a history of cancer (cohort B), treated at the primary centre during the same time period (12th March- 7th April 2020). Results: A total of 52 electronic patient records during the study time period were reviewed. Cohort A (median age 76 years, 56% males) and cohort B (median age 58 years, 62% male) comprised of 26 patients each. With the exclusion of cancer, both had a median of 2 comorbidities. Within cohort A, the most frequent underlying cancer was colorectal (5\/26) and prostate cancer (5\/26), and 77% of patients in Cohort A had received previous anti-cancer therapy. The most common presenting symptoms were cough and pyrexia in both cohorts. Frequent laboratory findings included lymphopenia, anaemia and elevated CRP in both cohorts, whilst hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia was predominantly seen amongst patients with cancer. Median duration of admission was 7 days in both cohorts. The mortality rate was the same in both cohorts (23%), with median age of mortality of 80 years. Of cancer patients who died, all were advanced stage, had been treated with palliative intent and had received anti-cancer therapy within 13 days of admission. Conclusion: Old age, late stage of cancer diagnosis and multiple co-morbidities adversely influence the outcome of patients with COVID-19 positive patients. Whilst extra caution is warranted in the administration of anti-cancer therapies pertaining to the risk of immune-suppression, this data does not demonstrate a higher risk to cancer patients compared to their non-cancer counterparts.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nalinie Joharatnam-Hogan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Hochhauser","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kai-Keen Shiu","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hannah Rush","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Valerie Crolley","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emma Butcher","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anand Sharma","author_inst":"Mount Vernon Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aun Muhammad","author_inst":"Whittington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Vasdev","author_inst":"Lister Hospital"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"Princess Alexandra Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ganna Kantser","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aramita Saha","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fharat Raja","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Bridgewater","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Khurum Khan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20062828","rel_title":"Estimation of airborne viral emission: quanta emission rate of SARS-CoV-2 for infection risk assessment","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20062828","rel_abs":"Airborne transmission is a pathway of contagion that is still not sufficiently investigated despite the evidence in the scientific literature of the role it can play in the context of an epidemic. While the medical research area dedicates efforts to find cures and remedies to counteract the effects of a virus, the engineering area is involved in providing risk assessments in indoor environments by simulating the airborne transmission of the virus during an epidemic. To this end, virus air emission data are needed. Unfortunately, this information is usually available only after the outbreak, based on specific reverse engineering cases. In this work, a novel approach to estimate the viral load emitted by a contagious subject on the basis of the viral load in the mouth, the type of respiratory activity (e.g. breathing, speaking), respiratory physiological parameters (e.g. inhalation rate), and activity level (e.g. resting, standing, light exercise) is proposed. The estimates of the proposed approach are in good agreement with values of viral loads of well-known diseases from the literature. The quanta emission rates of an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subject, with a viral load in the mouth of 108 copies mL-1, were 10.5 quanta h-1 and 320 quanta h-1 for breathing and speaking respiratory activities, respectively, at rest. In the case of light activity, the values would increase to 33.9 quanta h-1 and 1.03x103 quanta h-1, respectively. The findings in terms of quanta emission rates were then adopted in infection risk models to demonstrate its application by evaluating the number of people infected by an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in Italian indoor microenvironments before and after the introduction of virus containment measures. The results obtained from the simulations clearly highlight that a key role is played by proper ventilation in containment of the virus in indoor environments.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giorgio Buonanno","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Stabile","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Hannah Rush","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Valerie Crolley","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emma Butcher","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anand Sharma","author_inst":"Mount Vernon Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aun Muhammad","author_inst":"Whittington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Vasdev","author_inst":"Lister Hospital"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"Princess Alexandra Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ganna Kantser","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aramita Saha","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fharat Raja","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Bridgewater","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Khurum Khan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20062794","rel_title":"Modelling and analysis of COVID-19 epidemic in India.","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20062794","rel_abs":"COVID-19 epidemic is declared as the public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organisation in the second week of March 2020.

However, this test can take up to two days to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results, and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiologic findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history, and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 positive patients. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an AUC of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xueyan Mei","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Hao-Chih Lee","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kaiyue Diao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Mingqian Huang","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Bin Lin","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Chenyu Liu","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Zongyu Xie","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Yixuan Ma","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Philip M.

This possibility has been discussed for at least two decades, and careful matching of patient ventilation requirements is advised. However, with a large range of lung compliance and other characteristics, which may also vary with time, good matching is difficult to achieve. Adjusting the impedance of the flow path between ventilator and patient gives the opportunity to control the airway pressure and hence flow and volume individually for each patient. Several groups are now investigating this, in particular the addition of a flow restrictor in the inspiration tube for the patient who is more compliant, or requires a lower tidal volume. In this paper, we show that a simple linear resistance-compliance model, termed the BathRC model, of the ventilator tubing system and lung allows direct calculation of the relationships between pressures, volumes, and required flow restriction. The BathRC model is experimentally validated using a GE Aisys CS2 ventilator connected to two test lungs. The pressure-flow relationships for two restrictors are experimentally determined, and despite the need to approximate them with a linear resistance characteristic, their effect in the breathing circuit is accurately predicted by the simple model. The BathRC model is freely available for download; we do not condone dual ventilation, but this tool is provided to demonstrate that flow restriction can be readily estimated. This research is part of a larger test, simulation and design investigation on dual ventilation being undertaken at the UoB and RUH.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew R Plummer","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Jonathan L du Bois","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Joseph M Flynn","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Jens Roesner","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

In the absence of a vaccine, interventions focused on physical distancing have been widely used to reduce community transmission. These physical distancing policies can only control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 if they are able to reduce the amount of close interpersonal contact in a population. To quantify the impact of these policies over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, we conducted three waves of contact surveys between March 22 and June 23, 2020. We find that rates of interpersonal contact have been dramatically reduced at all ages in the US, with an 82% (95\\% CI:80\\% -- 83\\%) reduction in the average number of daily contacts observed during the first wave compared to pre-pandemic levels. We find that this decline reduced the reproduction number, \\(R_0\\), to below one in March and early April (0.66, 95\\% CI:0.35 -- 0.88). However, with easing of physical distancing measures, we find increases in interpersonal contact rates over the subsequent two waves, pushing \\(R_0\\) above 1. We also find significant differences in numbers of reported contacts by age, gender, race and ethnicity. Certain demographic groups, including people under 45, males, and Black and Hispanic respondents, have significantly higher contact rates than the rest of the population. Tracking changes in interpersonal contact patterns can provide rapid assessments of the impact of physical distancing policies over the course of the pandemic and help identify at-risk populations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dennis Feehan","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Mahmud","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Joseph M Flynn","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Jens Roesner","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well-founded dynamical description of disease incidence. For COVID-19 with infectiousness peak- ing before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build-up of exposed indi- viduals which creates challenges for containment strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity raises questions about the adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks on the level of a whole country. Here, we show that by applying sequential data assimilation to the stochastic SEIR epidemic model, we can capture the dynamic behavior of outbreaks on a regional level. Regional modeling, with rela- tively low numbers of infected and demographic noise, accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted models, short-term predictions can be achieved. Thus, with the help of these sequential data assimilation methods, more realistic epidemic models are within reach.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ralf Engbert","author_inst":"University of Potsdam, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maximilian M.

It is likely different countries and populations respond differently to the same NPIs and that these differences are reflected in the epidemic development. Methods We build a Bayesian model that estimates the number of deaths on a given day dependent on changes in the basic reproductive number, R0, due to changes in mobility patterns. We utilize mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R0 is estimated through the model. Findings The changes in mobility have a large overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change. The grocery and pharmacy sector is estimated to account for 97 % of the reduction in R0 (95% confidence interval [0*79,0*99]). Interpretation Our model predicts three-week epidemic forecasts, using real-time observations of changes in mobility patterns, which can provide governments with direct feedback on the effects of their NPIs.

I develop a flexible behavioral, dynamic, and sectorial epidemic policy model comprising both endogenous virus transmission and public health and citizen responses. Applicable to the full epidemic cycle including confinement, deconfinement, and resurgence, the model allows exploring the multivariate impact of distinct policy interventions, including general and targeted testing and social contact reduction efforts. Using a cross-sectional calibration to data on the ongoing coronavirus disease outbreak about reported cases and deaths, tests performed, and social interactions from six countries (South Korea, Germany, Italy, France, Sweden, and the United States), I demonstrate how early, rapid, and extensive buildup of testing and social contact reduction efforts interplay to suppress the outbreak. I then use the model to show and quantify limits to the extent of deconfinement and illustrate the critical role of targeted approaches for managing post peak deconfinement and resurgence. To aid necessary public and expert understanding of outbreak control strategies the model is accessible in the form of a web-based management flight simulator.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeroen Struben","author_inst":"emlyon business school"},{"author_name":"Arne Elofsson","author_inst":"Stockholm University\/Science for Life Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Reinhold Kliegl","author_inst":"University of Potsdam, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Reich","author_inst":"University of Potsdam, Germany"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

In the United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies' effect with greater accuracy. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities at the county level in the United States. We estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders using a difference-in-differences design that accounts for unmeasured local variation in factors like health systems and demographics and for unmeasured temporal variation in factors like national mitigation actions and access to tests. Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results show that the orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2) reduction in weekly cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0) reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3 to 80.2) reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks. These results suggest that stay-at-home orders reduced confirmed cases by 390,000 (170,000 to 680,000) and fatalities by 41,000 (27,000 to 59,000) within the first three weeks in localities where they were implemented.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James H.

We improve on their estimation by using data from the number of patients in intensive care, which provides two advantages over the number of deaths: first, it can be used to construct a signal with less bias: as the healthcare system of a country reaches saturation, the mortality rate would be expected to increase, which would bias the estimates of Rt and of the impact of measures implemented to contain the epidemic; and second, it is a signal with less lag, as the time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission is shorter than the time from onset to death. The intensive care signal we use is not just the number of people in ICU, as this would also be biased if the healthcare system has reached saturation. Instead, we estimate the daily demand of intensive care, as the sum of two components: the part that is satisfied (new ICU admissions) and the part that is not (which results in excess mortality). Thanks to the advantages of this ICU signal in terms of timeliness and bias, we find that most of the countries in the study have already reached Rt<1 with 95% confidence (Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Switzerland, but not Belgium or Sweden), whereas the original methodology of Flaxman et al (2020), even with updated data, would only find Rt<1 with 95% confidence for Italy and Switzerland.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Hurtado","author_inst":"NA"},{"author_name":"David Tinajero","author_inst":"NA"},{"author_name":"Nick Obradovich","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Human Development"},{"author_name":"Remy Levin","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

It can be easily modified to develop new models for the problem. A generalized method is adopted to simulate worldwide outbreaks in an efficient, fast, and simple way. To get a good tracking of the virus spread, a sum of sigmoid functions was proposed to capture any dynamic changes in the data. The parameters used for the input (infection and recovery rate functions) are computed using the parameter estimation tool in MATLAB. Several statistic methods were applied for the rate function including linear, mean, root-mean-square, and standard deviation. In addition, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is employed and proposed to train the model and predict its output. The programs can be used as a teaching tool and for research studies.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ismael Khorshed Abdulrahman","author_inst":"Erbil Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Jiarui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Economics, University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Timothy Schwieg","author_inst":"Becker Friedman Institute, University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Remy Levin","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

In particular, the growth rate of the infection has been fitted as an exponential decay, as compared to a linear decay, reported previously. The model has been validated with the data of China and South Korea, where the pandemic is nearing to its end. The data of Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden show that the peak of the infection has reached i.e. a time when the new infections will start to decrease as compared to the previous day. The model predicts the approximate number of total infections at the end of the outbreak. The model prediction of the USA, and Brazil show that the peak will reach in the next two-three weeks. The total number of infections in the USA is estimated to be around 4 million by the model. The reported data of India show the start of disease evolution, with a large initial scatter in the growth rate. The possible peak date and the total number of infections are predicted using the data available.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajneesh Bhardwaj","author_inst":"IIT Bombay"},{"author_name":"Joel Tibabwetiza Muhanguzi","author_inst":"Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Oscar Dembe","author_inst":"Makerere Univesity"},{"author_name":"Sheba Kirabo","author_inst":"Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

We first fit the constant transmission rate parameter to the epidemic data in Mayotte during an early exponential growth phase using an algorithm with a package of software R and based on a Likewook Maximum estimator. Thus, after the intervention and control measures imposed by the gouvernement, we introduce a simple temporally varying and exponentially decreasing transmission rate with a control parameter. This allows us to understand wheter these interventions are having the desired impact of controlling the epidemic by pointing out some percentages to maintain control which is critical in Mayotte given the fragility of its health infrastructure and the significant fraction of the population without access to water.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Solym MANOU-ABI","author_inst":"IMAG-Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Julien BALICCHI","author_inst":"French National Health Agency of Mayotte"},{"author_name":"Oscar Dembe","author_inst":"Makerere Univesity"},{"author_name":"Sheba Kirabo","author_inst":"Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

This suggests the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 patients is imminent. We find that there is significant regional variation in different regions of the UK and that this is changing over time. Within England currently the reproductive ratio is lowest in the Midlands (1.11 95% CI 1.07; 1.14), and highest in the North East of England (1.38 95% CI 1.33-1.42). It remains unclear whether the overall reduction in the reproductive number is a result of social distancing measures, due to the long and variable time delays between infection and positive detection of cases.

To date, many epidemic projections and policies addressing COVID-19 have been designed without seroprevalence data to inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a community sample drawn from Santa Clara County. Methods On April 3-4, 2020, we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a sample of individuals living within the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We estimate weights to adjust our sample to match the zip code, sex, and race\/ethnicity distribution within the county. We report both the weighted and unweighted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also adjust for test performance characteristics by combining data from 16 independent samples obtained from manufacturer's data, regulatory submissions, and independent evaluations: 13 samples for specificity (3,324 specimens) and 3 samples for sensitivity (157 specimens). Results The raw prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in our sample was 1.5% (exact binomial 95CI 1.1-2.0%). Test performance specificity in our data was 99.5% (95CI 99.2-99.7%) and sensitivity was 82.8% (95CI 76.0-88.4%). The unweighted prevalence adjusted for test performance characteristics was 1.2% (95CI 0.7-1.8%). After weighting for population demographics of Santa Clara County, the prevalence was 2.8% (95CI 1.3-4.7%), using bootstrap to estimate confidence bounds. These prevalence point estimates imply that 54,000 (95CI 25,000 to 91,000 using weighted prevalence; 23,000 with 95CI 14,000-35,000 using unweighted prevalence) people were infected in Santa Clara County by early April, many more than the approximately 1,000 confirmed cases at the time of the survey. Conclusions The estimated population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection may be much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. More studies are needed to improve precision of prevalence estimates. Locally-derived population prevalence estimates should be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eran Bendavid","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Bianca Mulaney","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Neeraj Sood","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Soleil Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emilia Ling","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Bromley-Dulfano","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Cara Lai","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zoe Weissberg","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Saavedra-Walker","author_inst":"Health Education is Power, Inc.,"},{"author_name":"James Tedrow","author_inst":"The Compliance Resource Group, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dona Tversky","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bogan","author_inst":"Bogan Associates"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

We document important variation in the at-risk population across states, counties, and industries that could provide a strategic underpinning to a staged return to work.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sammantha Maher","author_inst":"EcoHealth Alliance, New York City, NY"},{"author_name":"Alexandra E Hill","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Peter Britton","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Eli P Fenichel","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Peter Daszak","author_inst":"EcoHealth Alliance"},{"author_name":"Carlos Zambrana-Torrelio","author_inst":"EcoHealth Alliance"},{"author_name":"Jude Bayham","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Zoe Weissberg","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Saavedra-Walker","author_inst":"Health Education is Power, Inc.,"},{"author_name":"James Tedrow","author_inst":"The Compliance Resource Group, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dona Tversky","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bogan","author_inst":"Bogan Associates"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

As a result, many governments have resorted to widespread social distancing measures and mass quarantines ('lock-downs') to reduce transmission and to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. However, such measures impose heavy human and societal costs. Automated or semi-automated digital contact tracing, in conjunction with scaled-up community testing, has been proposed as a key part of exit strategies from lockdowns. However, the effectiveness of these approaches to contact tracing is unclear, and to be effective, trusted, and widely adopted such technology must overcome several challenges. Methods and analysis We will perform a rapid systematic review to assess the effectiveness of automated and semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing, and identify key considerations for successful implementation, to inform the control of COVID-19. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Medical COVID information portal, OVID Global Health, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, BioRxiv, and arXiv for peer-reviewed and pre-print papers on automated or semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing of COVID-19, another respiratory disease with pandemic potential (limited to SARS, MERS, or pandemic influenza), or Ebola, in human populations. Studies will be eligible if published in English between 1 January 2000 and 14 April 2020. We will synthesise study findings narratively and will consider meta-analysis if >=3 suitable studies with comparable interventions and outcomes are available. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this review. We plan to disseminate findings via pre-print, journal publication, through social media and web-based platforms and through direct stakeholder engagement.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isobel Braithwaite","author_inst":"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Tom Callender","author_inst":"Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"},{"author_name":"Miriam Bullock","author_inst":"UCL Collaborative Centre for Inclusion Health, University College London"},{"author_name":"Rob Aldridge","author_inst":"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Daszak","author_inst":"EcoHealth Alliance"},{"author_name":"Carlos Zambrana-Torrelio","author_inst":"EcoHealth Alliance"},{"author_name":"Jude Bayham","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Zoe Weissberg","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Saavedra-Walker","author_inst":"Health Education is Power, Inc.,"},{"author_name":"James Tedrow","author_inst":"The Compliance Resource Group, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dona Tversky","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bogan","author_inst":"Bogan Associates"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

On March 16th 2020, we presented a Position Paper proposing a research hypothesis concerning the association between higher mortality rates due to COVID-19 observed in Northern Italy and the peaks of particulate matter concentrations, frequently exceeding the legal limit of 50 micrograms\/m3 as PM10 daily average Methods: To assess environmental factors related to the spread of the COVID-19 in Italy from February 24th to March 13th (the date when the lockdown has been imposed over Italy), official daily data relevant to ambient PM10 levels were collected from all Italian Provinces between February 9th and February 29th , taking into account the average time (estimated in 17 days) elapsed between the initial infection and the recorded COVID positivity. In addition to the number of exceedances of PM10 daily limit value, we considered also population data and daily travelling information per each Province. Results. PM10 daily limit value exceedances appear to be a significant predictor (p <0.001) of infection in univariate analyses. Less polluted Provinces had a median of 0.03 infection cases over 1000 residents, while most polluted Provinces had a median of 0.26 cases over 1000 residents. Thirty-nine out of 41 Northern Italian Provinces resulted in the category with highest PM10 levels, while 62 out of 66 Southern Provinces presented low PM10 concentrations (p<0.001). In Milan, the average growth rate before the lockdown was significantly higher than Rome (0.34 vs. 0.27 per day, with a doubling time of 2.0 days vs. 2.6), suggesting a basic reproductive number R0>6.0, comparable with the highest values estimated for China.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonardo Setti","author_inst":"Univerisity of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Passarini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Gianluigi De Gennaro","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Pierluigi Barbieri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maria Grazia Perrone","author_inst":"Environmental Research Division, TCR TECORA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piazzalunga","author_inst":"Water & Life Lab Groupe Carso, Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Massimo Borelli","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Jolanda Palmisani","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Alessia Di Gilio","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, Milan"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, Milan"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bogan","author_inst":"Bogan Associates"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

Methods: This study was carried out according to three dimensions. In the first, the actual number of infected people was estimated. In the second, the expected total numbers of infected people, deaths, hospitalizations have been predicted in the case of no intervention. In the third, the distribution of the expected number of infected people and deaths, and ICU and non-ICU bed needs over time has been predicted via a SEIR-based simulator (TURKSAS) in four scenarios. Results: According to the number of deaths, the estimated number of infected people in Turkey on March 21 was 123,030. In the case of no intervention the expected number of infected people is 72,091,595 and deaths is 445,956, the attack rate is 88,1%, and the mortality ratio is 0,54%. The ICU bed capacity in Turkey is expected to be exceeded by 4,4-fold and non-ICU bed capacity by 3,21-fold. In the second and third scenarios compliance with NPIs makes a difference of 94,303 expected deaths. In both scenarios, the predicted peak value of occupied ICU and non-ICU beds remains below Turkey's capacity. Discussion: Predictions show that around 16 million people can be prevented from being infected and 94,000 deaths can be prevented by full compliance with the measures taken. Modelling epidemics and establishing decision support systems is an important requirement.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seyma Arslan","author_inst":"Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Public Health Department"},{"author_name":"Muhammed Yusuf Ozdemir","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Abdullah Ucar","author_inst":"Istanbul University, Health Sciences Institute"},{"author_name":"Pierluigi Barbieri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maria Grazia Perrone","author_inst":"Environmental Research Division, TCR TECORA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piazzalunga","author_inst":"Water & Life Lab Groupe Carso, Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Massimo Borelli","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Jolanda Palmisani","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Alessia Di Gilio","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, Milan"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, Milan"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bogan","author_inst":"Bogan Associates"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.
