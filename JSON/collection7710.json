Its severity is best described by two parameters: its ability to spread and its lethality. Here, we combine a mathematical model with a cohort analysis approach to determine the range of case fatality rates (CFR). We use a logistical function to describe the exponential growth and subsequent flattening of COVID-19 CFR that depends on three parameters: the final CFR (L), the CFR growth rate (k), and the onset-to-death interval (t0). Using the logistic model with specific parameters (L, k, and t0), we calculate the number of deaths each day for each cohort. We build an objective function that minimizes the root mean square error between the actual and predicted values of cumulative deaths and run multiple simulations by altering the three parameters. Using all of these values, we find out which set of parameters returns the lowest error when compared to the number of actual deaths. We were able to predict the CFR much closer to reality at all stages of the viral outbreak compared to traditional methods. This model can be used far more effectively than current models to estimate the CFR during an outbreak, allowing for better planning. The model can also help us better understand the impact of individual interventions on the CFR. With much better data collection and labeling, we should be able to improve our predictive power even further.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charit S Narayanan","author_inst":"Mission San Jose High School"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20045401","rel_title":"A case of SARS-CoV-2 carrier for 32 days with several times false negative nucleic acid tests","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20045401","rel_abs":"In 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei, China, causing severe respiratory disease in humans, and has been identified as a public health emergency of international concern. With the spread of the virus, there are more and more false negative cases of RT-PCR nucleic acid detection in the early stage of potential infection. In this paper, we collected the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, outcomes, laboratory results and images of a SARS-CoV-2 carrier with no significant past medical history. The patient was quarantined because of her colleague had been diagnosed. After the onset of clinical symptoms, chest CT results showed patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) in her lungs, but it took a total of nine nucleic acid tests to confirm the diagnosis, among which the first eight RT-PCR results were negative or single-target positive. In addition to coughing up phlegm during her stay in the hospital, she did not develop chills, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other clinical symptoms. Since initial antiviral treatment, the lung lesions were absorbed. But the sputum nucleic acid test was still positive. In combination with antiviral and immune therapy, the patient tested negative for the virus. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was detected only in the lower respiratory tract samples (sputum) throughout the diagnosis and treatment period. This is a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with common symptoms, and her diagnosis has undergone multiple false negatives ,suggesting that it is difficult to identify certain carriers of the virus and that such patients may also increase the spread of the SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lingjie Song","author_inst":"Non-coding RNA and Drug Discovery Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."},{"author_name":"Guibao Xiao","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Ziyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianqin Zhang","author_inst":"Chengdu medical college"},{"author_name":"Zhan Gao","author_inst":"Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shixia Sun","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Ziyang City"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Shaoxing Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Youjun Feng","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Guangxin Luan","author_inst":"Chengdu medical college"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lin","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Ziyang City"},{"author_name":"Miao He","author_inst":"Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."},{"author_name":"Xu Jia","author_inst":"Non-coding RNA and Drug Discovery Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20051763","rel_title":"Virologic and clinical characteristics for prognosis of severe COVID-19: a retrospective observational study in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20051763","rel_abs":"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has progressed to a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The WHO and the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued interim clinical guidance for management of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but there is limited data on the virologic and clinical characteristics for prognosis of severe COVID-19. Methods: A total of 50 patients with severe COVID-19 were divided into good and poor recovery groups. The dynamic viral shedding and serological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were explored. The risk factors associated with poor recovery and lung lesion resolutions were identified. In addition, the potential relationships among the viral shedding, the pro-inflammatory response, and lung lesion evolutions were characterized. Results: A total of 58% of the patients had poor recovery and were more likely to have a prolonged interval of viral shedding. The longest viral shedding was 57 days after symptom onset. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid therapy, consolidation on chest computed-tomography (CT), and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive were all associated with poor recovery. Additionally, the odds of impaired lung lesion resolutions were higher in patients with hypoproteinemia, hyperlipemia, and elevated levels of IL-4 and ferritin. Finally, viral shedding and proinflammatory responses were closely correlated with lung lesion evolutions on chest CT. Conclusions Patients with severe COVID-19 have prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed intermittent viral shedding. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid usage, and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive might be utilized as predicative factors for the patients with poor recovery.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sha Fu","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Fu","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yang Song","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Health Management, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Pin-hua Pan","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chunhu Zhang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Jiang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Deming Tan","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuegong Fan","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinping Sha","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jingdong Ma","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Health Management, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yan Huang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shaling Li","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yixiang Zheng","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhaoxin Qian","author_inst":"Xiangya hospital, Central South Univrsity"},{"author_name":"Zeng Xiong","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Lizhi Xiao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Huibao Long","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianghai Chen","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi Ouyang","author_inst":"Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University,Changsha,China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20051557","rel_title":"Modelling fatality curves of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of intervention strategies","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20051557","rel_abs":"The main objective of the present paper is twofold: first, to model the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease, as represented by the cumulative number of deaths as a function of time; and second, to use the corresponding mathematical model to study the effectiveness of possible intervention strategies. We applied the Richards growth model (RGM) to the COVID-19 fatality curves from several countries, where we used the data from the Johns Hopkins University database up to May 8, 2020. Countries selected for analysis with the RGM were China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea, and Spain. The RGM was shown to describe very well the fatality curves of China, which is in a late stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as of the other above countries, which supposedly are in the middle or towards the end of the outbreak at the time of this writing. We also analysed the case of Brazil, which is in an initial sub-exponential growth regime, and so we used the generalised growth model which is more appropriate for such cases. An analytic formula for the efficiency of intervention strategies within the context of the RGM is derived. Our findings show that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, after the onset of the epidemic, during which effective countermeasures can be taken. We applied our intervention model to the COVID-19 fatality curve of Italy of the outbreak to illustrate the effect of several possible interventions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovani L.

METHODS: We used the LASSO aggression and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the predictive factors associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, and established the diagnostic nomogram for COVID-19 pneumonia using multivariable regression. This diagnostic nomogram was assessed by the internal and external validation data set. Further, we plotted decision curves and clinical impact curve to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this diagnostic nomogram. RESULTS: The predictive factors including the epidemiological history, wedge-shaped or fan-shaped lesion parallel to or near the pleura, bilateral lower lobes, ground glass opacities, crazy paving pattern and white blood cell (WBC) count were contained in the nomogram. In the primary cohort, the C-statistic for predicting the probability of the COVID-19 pneumonia was 0.967, even higher than the C-statistic (0.961) in initial viral nucleic acid nomogram which was established using the univariable regression. The C-statistic was 0.848 in external validation cohort. Good calibration curves were observed for the prediction probability in the internal validation and external validation cohort. The nomogram both performed well in terms of discrimination and calibration. Moreover, decision curve and clinical impact curve were also beneficial for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

Countries need rapid data on the prevalence of the virus in communities to enable rapid containment. However, the equipment, human and laboratory resources required for conducting individual RT-PCR is prohibitive. One technique to reduce the number of tests required is the pooling of samples for analysis by RT-PCR prior to testing. Methods: We conducted a mathematical analysis of pooling strategies for infection rate classification using group testing and for the identification of individuals by testing pooled clusters of samples. Findings: On the basis of the proposed pooled testing strategy we calculate the probability of false alarm, the probability of detection, and the average number of tests required as a function of the pool size. We find that when the sample size is 256, with a maximum pool size of 64, with only 7.3 tests on the average, we can distinguish between prevalences of 1% and 5% with a probability of detection of 95% and probability of false alarm of 4%. Interpretation: The pooling of RT-PCR samples is a cost-effective technique for providing much-needed course-grained data on the prevalence of COVID-19. This is a powerful tool in providing countries with information that can facilitate a response to the pandemic that is evidence-based and saves the most lives possible with the resources available.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishna Narayanan","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Frost","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Anoosheh Heidarzadeh","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Katie K Tseng","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Sayantan Banerjee","author_inst":"World Health Organization, South East Asia Regional Office"},{"author_name":"Jacob John","author_inst":"Christian Medical College, Vellore, India"},{"author_name":"Ramanan Laxminarayan","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ting Yang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daqing Chen","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liang Wang","author_inst":"College of Public Health, East Tennessee State University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Liu","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xian Shen","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shengwei Jin","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"E Fabian Cardozo-Ojeda","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Boeckh","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Joshua T Schiffer","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Zeng Xiong","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Lizhi Xiao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Huibao Long","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianghai Chen","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi Ouyang","author_inst":"Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University,Changsha,China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052183","rel_title":"Clinical meanings of rapid serological assay in patients tested for SARS-Co2 RT-PCR","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052183","rel_abs":"Background RT-PCR test for identifiction of viral nucleic acid is the current standard diagnostic method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease but technical reasons limit the utilization of this assay on large scale screenings.

Since modern ICU ventilators are powerful devices that can deliver very high gas flow rates and pressures, multiple physicians have attempted to ventilate more than one patient on a single ventilator -- so-called 'vent splitting'. Early applications of this approach have utilized simple concatenations of ventilator tubing and T-pieces, to provide flow to more than one patient. Additional approaches using custom flow splitters -- sometimes made using 3D printing technologies -- have also advanced into the clinic with FDA approval. However, heretofore there has been less progress made on controlling individual ventilatory pressures for patients with severe lung disease. Given the inherent variability and instability of lung compliance amongst patients with COVID-19, there remains an important need to provide a means of extending ventilator usefulness to more than one patient, but in a way that provides more tailored pressures that can be titrated over time. In this descriptive report, we provide the basis for a ventilator circuit that can support two patients with individualized peak inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures. The circuit is comprised of exclusively 'off the shelf' materials and is inexpensive to produce. The circuit can be used with typical ICU ventilators, and with anesthesia ventilators used in operating rooms. Inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures for each patient can be titrated over time, without changes for one patient affecting the ventilation parameters of the other patient. Using in-line spirometry, individual tidal volumes can be measured for each patient. This Pressure-Regulated Ventilator Splitting (PReVentS) Yale University protocol operates under a pressure-control ventilatory mode, and may function optimally when patients are not triggering breaths from the ventilator. This method has been tested thus far only in the laboratory with mock lungs, and has not yet been deployed in animals or in patients.

We hypothesized that population level usage of face masks may be negatively associated SARS CoV2 spread. Methods At a country level, linear regression was used to assess the association between COVID19 diagnoses per inhabitant and the national promotion of face masks in public (coded as a binary variable), controlling for the age of the COVID19 epidemic and testing intensity. Results Eight of the 49 countries with available data advocated wearing face masks in public: China, Czechia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia. In multivariate analysis face mask use was negatively associated with number of COVID19 cases\/inhabitant (coef. -326, 95% CI -601- -51, P=0.021).

Recent studies propose such protection may extend to the novel COVID-19 as well. This is a contested hypothesis. Methods: Our ecological study confronts this hypothesis. We examine the effects of BCG vaccination on countries' COVID-19 (a) cases and deaths (per million) and (b) exponential growth factors over specific periods of the pandemic. Since the BCG vaccine was derived from Mycobacterium bovis, a bacterium causing tuberculosis in cattle, having suffered from tuberculosis also may exert a non-specific protection against the COVID-19 as well. Along with BCG vaccination, we test the effect of the prevalence of tuberculosis. We employ multiple regression and principal component analysis (PCA) to control for potentially confounding variables (n = 16). Results: BCG vaccination policy and incidence of tuberculosis is associated with a reduction in both COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the effects of these two variables are additive ({approx} 5% to 15% of total unique variance explained). The study of exponential growth factors in the initial stages of the pandemic further shows that BCG vaccination exerts a significant effect (up to 35% of unique variance explained). Conclusions: Overall, these findings corroborate the hypothesis that BCG vaccination and exposure to tuberculosis may induce a non-specific protection against the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection, even after accounting for a large number of confounding influences. However, given the potential public-health benefits, our results indicate that the hypothesis deserves further attention and should not be hastily dismissed.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovanni Sala","author_inst":"Fujita Health University"},{"author_name":"Rik Chakraborti","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Christopher Newport University"},{"author_name":"Atsuhiko Ota","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Fujita Health University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tsuyoshi Miyakawa","author_inst":"Fujita Health University"},{"author_name":"Steven Nivison","author_inst":"Yale-New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elaine Fajardo","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Shamsuddin Akhtar","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Raredon","author_inst":"HB\/TR Collaborative Inc."},{"author_name":"Laura E.

Leaving the economy locked down for a long time is its own catastrophe. An SIR-type model with clear parameters suitable for public information, and both tracking and predictive capabilities which learns disease spread characteristics rapidly as policy changes, suggests that a solution to the problem is a partial unlock. Case load can be managed so as not to exceed critical resources such as ventilators, yet allow enough people to get sick that herd immunity develops and a full unlock can be achieved in as little as five weeks from beginning of implementation. The partial unlock could be for example 3 full working days per week. Given that not all areas or individuals will respond, and travel and public gatherings are still unlikely, the partial unlock might be 5 full working days per week. The model can be regionalized easily, and by expediting the resolution of the pandemic in the U.S. medical equipment and volunteers, many of them with already acquired immunity, can be made available to other countries.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert L Shuler","author_inst":"Shuler Research (former NASA JSC)"},{"author_name":"Chandra Couzens","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Saad B Omer","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Tsuyoshi Miyakawa","author_inst":"Fujita Health University"},{"author_name":"Steven Nivison","author_inst":"Yale-New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elaine Fajardo","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Shamsuddin Akhtar","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Raredon","author_inst":"HB\/TR Collaborative Inc."},{"author_name":"Laura E.

Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains allows for the reconstruction of transmission history connecting these infections. Here, we analyze 346 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from samples collected between 20 February and 15 March 2020 from infected patients in Washington State, USA. We found that the large majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections sampled during this time frame appeared to have derived from a single introduction event into the state in late January or early February 2020 and subsequent local spread, strongly suggesting cryptic spread of COVID-19 during the months of January and February 2020, before active community surveillance was implemented. We estimate a common ancestor of this outbreak clade as occurring between 18 January and 9 February 2020. From genomic data, we estimate an exponential doubling between 2.4 and 5.1 days. These results highlight the need for large-scale community surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 introductions and spread and the power of pathogen genomics to inform epidemiological understanding.","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Trevor Bedford","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Alexander L.

Italy has transitioned to the power-law regime for some time. For the other six nations-USA, Spain, Germany, France, Japan, and India-a power-law regime is beginning to appear after exponential growth. We argue that the transition from an exponential regime to a power-law regime may act as an indicator for flattening of the epidemic curve.

We propose a method for predicting both ICU requirements and the number of deaths, and which will enable the health authorities of the countries involved to plan the resources needed to face the pandemic as many days in advance as possible. Methods We use official Spanish data to predict ICU admissions and deaths based on the number of infections. We employ OLS to perform the econometric estimation, and through RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE forecast performance measures we select the best lagged predictor of both dependent variables. Findings For Spain, our prediction shows that the best predictor of ICU admissions is the number of people infected eight days before, and that the best predictor of deaths is the number of people infected five days before. In the first case, we obtain a 98% coefficient of determination, and in the second a 97% coefficient. The estimated delayed elasticities find that a 1% increase in the number of cases today will imply a 0.72% increase in ICU patients eight days later and a 1.09% increase in the number of deaths five days later. Interpretation The model is not intended to analyse the epidemiology of COVID-19. Our objective is rather to estimate a leading indicator of clinical needs. Having a forecast model available several days in advance can enable governments to more effectively face the gap between needs and resources triggered by the outbreak and thus reduce the deaths caused by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Angel Hierro-Recio","author_inst":"University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Antonio Jose Garzon-Gordon","author_inst":"University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Pedro Atienza-Montero","author_inst":"University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Jose Luis Marquez","author_inst":"Virgen del Rocio Hospital (Seville-Spain)"},{"author_name":"Francois Roger","author_inst":"ASTRE"},{"author_name":"Yann Kerr","author_inst":"CESBIO"},{"author_name":"Arun Nalla","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Gregory Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Adam Reinhardt","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Hong Xie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. Usually, to forecast epidemics, classical approaches need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here, we propose a data-driven, parameter-free, geometric approach to access the emergence of a pandemic state by studying the Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci network curvatures. Discrete Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those results can provide analogous results for COVID-19 epidemic time-series. We first compute both curvatures in a toy-model of epidemic time-series with delays, which allows us to create epidemic networks. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvatures can be a parameter-free estimate for identifying a pandemic state in the simulated epidemic. On this basis, we then compute both Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvatures for real epidemic networks built from COVID-19 epidemic time-series available at the World Health Organization (WHO). Both curvatures allow us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of our method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for the pandemic state, regardless of parameter estimation and stochastic modelling. This work opens the possibility of using discrete geometry to study epidemic networks.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danillo Barros de Souza","author_inst":"Departamento de Matematica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife-Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jonatas T.

The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. Moreover, the publicly available data on infection rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the January 24 till March 3 window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1. Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1 April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raj Dandekar","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"George Barbastathis","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Everlon Figueiroa","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Imunopatologia Keizo Asami  (LIKA)  -

Design: Systematic rapid review and meta-analysis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, searched up to 23 March 2020. Method: We selected observational and experimental studies examining the impact on mental health of epidemic outbreaks on HCWs. Titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer, and full texts were evaluated by two reviewers independently. We extracted study characteristics, symptoms, prevalence of mental health problems, risk factors, mental health interventions, and its impact. We assessed risk of bias for each individual study. We conducted a narrative and tabulated synthesis of the results. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. We followed the GRADE approach to assess the certainty in the evidence. Results: We included 61 studies (56 examining impact on mental health and five about interventions to reduce such impact). Most were conducted in Asia (59%), examined the impact of the SARS epidemic (69%), and took place in the hospital setting (79%). The pooled prevalence was higher for anxiety (45%, 95% CI 21 to 69%; 6 studies, 3,373 participants), followed by depression (38%, 95% CI 15 to 60%; 7 studies, 3,636 participants), acute stress disorder (31%, 95% CI 0 to 82%, 3 studies , 2,587 participants), burnout (29%, 95% CI 25 to 32%; 3 studies; 1,168 participants) and post-traumatic stress disorder (19%, 95% CI 11 to 26%, 10 studies, 3,121 participants). Based on 37 studies, we identified a broad number of risk factors for these conditions, including sociodemographic: younger age and female gender; social factors: lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization; and occupational: working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. Two out of five interventions identified were educational aimed to prevent mental health problems by increasing HCWs resilience. These interventions showed positive effects in confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty). One multifaceted intervention (based on training and organisational changes) targeted at hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic produced statistically significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). The impact of the two remaining interventions (multifaceted and based on psychotherapy provision) was unreported. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout, was high both during and after the outbreaks. These problems not only have a long-lasting effect on the mental health of HCWs, but also hinder the urgent response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, by jeopardising attention and decision-making. Governments and healthcare authorities should take urgent actions to protect the mental health of HCWs. In light of the limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified in this study represent important targets for future interventions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ignacio Ricci Cabello","author_inst":"Institut d'Investigacio Sanitaria Illes Balears"},{"author_name":"Jose F Meneses Echavez","author_inst":"Division for Health Services, Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

The clinical evidence to date suggests that pregnant and childbearing women, and their babies are not at increased risk of either getting infected, or of having severe symptoms or consequences than the population as a whole. There is no evidence on the short- and longer-term psychological impacts of restrictive practices or social and personal constraints for childbearing women during COVID-19 in particular, or infection pandemics in general. The potential for adverse mental health consequences of the pandemic should be recognised as a critical public health concern, together with appropriate care and support to prevent and ameliorate any negative impacts.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anastasia Topalidou","author_inst":"THRIVE Centre, Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, University of Central Lancashire, UK"},{"author_name":"Gill Thomson","author_inst":"THRIVE Centre, Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, University of Central Lancashire, UK"},{"author_name":"Soo Downe","author_inst":"THRIVE Centre, Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, University of Central Lancashire, UK"},{"author_name":"David Fraile-Navarro","author_inst":"Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Maria Antonia Fiol de Roque","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa), Palma, Illes Balears, Spain"},{"author_name":"Guadalupe Pastor Moreno","author_inst":"Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red (CIBERESP)"},{"author_name":"Adoracion Castro","author_inst":"Research Institute of Health Sciences (IUNICS)"},{"author_name":"Isabel Ruiz Perez","author_inst":"Escuela Andaluza de Salud Publica"},{"author_name":"Rocio Zamanillo Campos","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Daniela Goncalves-Bradley","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

Furthermore, patients infected with similar strains (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) suffered testis, liver, or thyroid damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as an entry point into cells for some strains of coronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). Our hypothesis was that as ACE2 is essential to the SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion, then brain regions where ACE2 is the most expressed are more likely to be disturbed by the infection. Thus, the expression of other genes which are also over-expressed in those damaged areas could be affected. We used mRNA expression levels data of genes provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (ABA), and computed spatial correlations with the LinkRbrain platform. Genes whose co-expression is spatially correlated to that of ACE2 were then clustered into 16 groups, depending on the organ in which they are the most expressed (as described by the NCBI genes database). The list of organs where genes sharing local over-expression with the ACE2 gene are the most expressed is astonishingly similar to the organs affected by Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colline Lapina","author_inst":"Ecole Nationale Superieure de Cognitique"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Rodic","author_inst":"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique"},{"author_name":"Denis Peschanski","author_inst":"Universite Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne Institut des Sciences Juridique et Philosophique de la Sorbonne"},{"author_name":"SALMA MESMOUDI","author_inst":"Paris1 university"},{"author_name":"Wenlong Jia","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yiqi Jiang","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Shuai Cheng Li","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rocio Zamanillo Campos","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Daniela Goncalves-Bradley","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

We carried out a rapid review to summarize the existing evidence on SARS-CoV-2 survivorship and methods to disinfect PPE gear, particularly N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR). In the absence of data on SARS-CoV-2, we focused on the sister virus SARS-CoV-1. We propose a two-step disinfection process, which is conservative in the absence of robust evidence on SARS-CoV-2. This disinfection protocol is based on an initial storage of PPE for [&ge;]4 days, followed by ultraviolet light (UVC), dry heat treatment, or chemical disinfection. Importantly, each of the two steps is based on independent disinfection mechanisms, so that our proposed protocol is a multiplicative system, maximising the efficacy of our disinfection process. This method could be rapidly implemented in other healthcare settings, while testing of each method is undertaken, increasing the frontline supply of PPE, and avoiding many of the upstream issues of supply chain disruption currently being faced.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 G B Derraik","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"William A Anderson","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth A Connelly","author_inst":"Taranaki District Health Board"},{"author_name":"Yvonne C Anderson","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Wenlong Jia","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yiqi Jiang","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Shuai Cheng Li","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rocio Zamanillo Campos","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Daniela Goncalves-Bradley","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

The infectious disease has spread globally and become a major threat to public health. Purpose: We aim to investigate the ultra-high-resolution CT (UHR-CT) findings of imported COVID-19 related pneumonia from the initial diagnosis to early-phase follow-up. Methods: This retrospective study included confirmed cases with early-stage COVID-19 related pneumonia imported from the epicenter. Initial and early-phase follow-up UHR-CT scans (within 5 days) were reviewed for characterizing the radiological findings. The normalized total volumes of ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations were calculated and compared during the radiological follow-up by artificial-intelligence-based methods. Results: Eleven patients (3 males and 8 females, aged 32-74 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. Subpleural GGOs with inter\/intralobular septal thickening were typical imaging findings. Other diagnostic CT features included distinct margins (8\/11, 73%), pleural retraction or thickening (7\/11, 64%), intralesional vasodilatation (6\/11, 55%). Normalized volumes of pulmonary GGOs (p=0.003) and consolidations (p=0.003) significantly increased during the CT follow-up. Conclusions: The abnormalities of GGOs with peripleural distribution, consolidated areas, septal thickening, pleural involvement and intralesional vasodilatation on UHR-CT indicate the diagnosis of COVID-19. COVID-19 cases could manifest significantly progressed GGOs and consolidations with increased volume during the early-phase CT follow-up.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shaomao Lv","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jinan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jianghe Kang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Youbin Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhipeng Feng","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Shuai Cheng Li","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rocio Zamanillo Campos","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Daniela Goncalves-Bradley","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -
