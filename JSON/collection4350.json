However, the spread of COVID-19 has differed in the African setting compared to countries on other continents. To predict the spread of COVID-19 in Africa and within each country on the continent, we applied a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model. Here, our results show that, overall, Africa is currently (May 29, 2020) at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, after which we predict the number of cases would begin to fall in June 2020. Furthermore, we predict that the ending phase of the pandemic would be in Mid-August 2020 and that decreasing cases of COVID-19 infections would be detected until around December 2020 and January 2021. Our results also reveal that of the 51 countries with reported COVID-19 cases, only nine, including South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia, are likely to report higher monthly COVID-19 cases in June 2020 than those reported in the previous months. Overall, at the end of this pandemic, we predict that approximately 279,000 (about 154,000 future cases) individuals in Africa would have been infected with the COVID-19 virus. Here, our predictions are data-driven and based on the previously observed trends in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shifts in the population dynamics and\/or changes in the infectiousness of the COVID-19 virus may require new forecasts of the disease spread.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Musalula Sinkala","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Panji Nkhoma","author_inst":"University of Zambia"},{"author_name":"Mildred Zulu","author_inst":"University of Zambia"},{"author_name":"Doris Kafita","author_inst":"University of Zambia"},{"author_name":"Rabecca Tembo","author_inst":"University of Zambia"},{"author_name":"Victor Daka","author_inst":"Copperbelt University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20118372","rel_title":"Modelling Singapore COVID-19 pandemic with a SEIR multiplex network model","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20118372","rel_abs":"In this paper, we have implemented a large-scale agent-based model to study the outbreak of coronavirus infectious diseases (COVID-19) in Singapore, taking into account complex human interaction pattern.

Due to the country specific scenario of high social and demographic heterogeneity, combined with limited testing capacity, lack of reliable data, under-reporting of cases, and restricted testing policy, the focus of this study is twofold: (i) to develop a generalized SEIRD model that implicitly takes into account the quarantine measures, and (ii) to estimate the response of the COVID-19 spread dynamics to perturbations\/uncertainties. By investigating the projections of cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases, as well as the effective reproduction number, we show that the model parameter related to social distancing measures is one of the most influential along all stages of the disease spread and the most influential after the infection peak. Due to such importance in the outcomes, different relaxation strategies of social distancing measures are investigated in order to determine which strategies are viable and less hazardous to the population. The results highlight the need of keeping social distancing policies to control the disease spread. Specifically, the considered scenario of abrupt social distancing relaxation implemented after the occurrence of the peak of positively diagnosed cases can prolong the epidemic, with a significant increase of the projected numbers of confirmed and death cases. An even worse scenario could occur if the quarantine relaxation policy is implemented before evidence of the epidemiological control, indicating the importance of the proper choice of when to start relaxing social distancing measures.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Tavares Volpatto","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Anna Claudia Mello Resende","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Lucas Anjos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Joao Vitor Oliveira Silva","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Claudia Mazza Dias","author_inst":"Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Regina Cerqueira Almeida","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Sandra Mara Cardoso Malta","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.122671","rel_title":"Optimized pseudotyping conditions for the SARS-COV2 Spike glycoprotein","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.122671","rel_abs":"The SARS-COV2 Spike glycoprotein is solely responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and facilitating fusion between the viral and host membranes. The ability to generate viral particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV2 Spike is useful for many types of studies, such as characterization of neutralizing antibodies or development of fusion-inhibiting small molecules. Here we characterized the use of a codon-optimized SARS-COV2 Spike glycoprotein for the generation of pseudotyped HIV-1, MLV, and VSV particles. The full-length Spike protein functioned inefficiently with all three systems but was enhanced over 10-fold by deleting the last 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of Spike. Infection of 293FT target cells was only possible if the cells were engineered to stably express the human ACE-2 receptor, but stably introducing an additional copy of this receptor did not further enhance susceptibility. Stable introduction of the Spike activating protease TMPRSS2 further enhanced susceptibility to infection by 5-10 fold. Substitution of the signal peptide of the Spike protein with an optimal signal peptide did not enhance or reduce infectious particle production. However, modification of a single amino acid in the furin cleavage site of Spike (R682Q) enhanced infectious particle production another 10-fold. With all enhancing elements combined, the titer of pseudotyped particles reached almost 106 infectious particles\/ml. Finally, HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV2 Spike was successfully used to detect neutralizing antibodies in plasma from COVID-19 patients, but not plasma from uninfected individuals.\n\nImportanceWhen working with pathogenic viruses, it is useful to have rapid quantitative tests for viral infectivity that can be performed without strict biocontainment restrictions. A common way of accomplishing this is to generate viral pseudoparticles that contain the surface glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus incorporated into a replication-defective viral particle that contains a sensitive reporter system. These pseudoparticles enter cells using the glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus leading to a readout for infection. Conditions that block entry of the pathogenic virus, such as neutralizing antibodies, will also block entry of the viral pseudoparticles. However, viral glycoproteins often are not readily suited for generating pseudoparticles. Here we describe a series of modifications that result in the production of relatively high titer SARS-COV2 pseudoparticles that are suitable for detection of neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc C Johnson","author_inst":"University of Missouri, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Terri D Lyddon","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Reinier Suarez","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Braxton Salcedo","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Mary LePique","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Maddie Graham","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Clifton L Ricana","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Carolyn A Robinson","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Detlef G Ritter","author_inst":"University of Missouri Health System"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.122986","rel_title":"Risk factors associated with mortality in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The objective of this study has been to characterize our patients from an epidemiological point of view and to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in our geographical area. We performed a prospective, longitudinal study on 188 hospitalized cases of SARS-Cov-2 infection in Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan, in Reus, Spain, admitted between 15th March 2020 and 30th April 2020. We recorded demographic data, signs and symptoms and comorbidities. We also calculated the Charlson and McCabe indices. A total of 43 deaths occurred during the study period. Deceased patients were older than the survivors (77.7 {+\/-} 13.1 vs. 62.8 {+\/-} 18.4 years; p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that fever, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, diabetes mellitus and cancer were the variables that showed independent and statistically significant associations with mortality. The Charlson index was more efficient than the McCabe index in discriminating between deceased and survivors. This is one of the first studies to describe the factors associated with mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain, and one of the few in the Mediterranean area. We identified the main factors independently associated with mortality in our population. Further studies in are needed to complete and confirm our findings.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simona Iftime","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Ana  F L\u00f3pez-Azcona","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Manuel Vicente-Miralles","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Ramon Descarrega-Reina","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Anna Hern\u00e1ndez-Aguilera","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Francesc Riu","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Josep  M Sim\u00f3","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Pedro Garrido","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Jorge Joven","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Jordi Camps","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Sant Joan de Reus"},{"author_name":"Antoni Castro","author_inst":"HUSJR"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20117366","rel_title":"When \"Shelter-in-Place\" Isn't Shelter That's Safe: A Rapid Analysis of Domestic Violence Case Differences During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Stay-at-Home Orders","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20117366","rel_abs":"Purpose: This study explored the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts on domestic violence (DV) with the following research questions: 1) Did DV occurring during the pandemic differ on certain variables from cases occurring on a typical day the previous year? 2) Did DV occurring after the implementation of shelter-in-place orders differ (on these same variables) from cases occurring prior to shelter-in-place orders? Methods: Two logistic regression models were developed to predict DV case differences before and during the pandemic. DV reports (N=4618) were collected from the Chicago Police Department. Cases from March 2019 and March 2020 were analyzed based on multiple variables. One model was set to predict case differences since the pandemic began, and another model was set to predict case differences during the shelter-in-place period later that month. Results: Both models were significant with multiple significant predictors. During the pandemic period, cases with arrests were 3% less likely to have occurred, and cases at residential locations were 22% more likely to have occurred. During the shelter-in-place period, cases at residential locations were 64% more likely to have occurred, and cases with child victims were 67% less likely to have occurred. Conclusions: This study offers a rapid analysis of DV case differences since the pandemic and shelter-in-place began. Additional variables and data sources could improve model explanatory power. Research, policy, and practice in this area must pivot to focus on protecting children whose access to mandated reporters has decreased and moving victims out of dangerous living situations into safe spaces.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Molly M.

There are though misconceptions on what means an effective high testing rate. This paper demonstrates that the rate of tests per detected case (Tests\/Case) is the critical variable, correlating negatively with the number of deaths. The higher the Tests\/Case rate, the lower the death rate, as this predictor is causally related to contact tracing and isolation of the vectors of the disease. Doubling Tests\/Case typically divides by about three the number of deaths. On the other hand, the per capita testing rate is a poor predictor for the performance of policies to fight the pandemics. The number of tests per 1,000 inhabitants (Tests\/1,000) tends to correlate positively with the number of deaths. In some cases, high levels of Tests\/1,000 just mean an epidemic that ran out of control, with an explosion of cases that demands high testing rates just to confirm the diagnosis of the seriously sick. This study also demonstrates that an early tracing strategy, with a high level of Tests\/Case, reduces combined costs of testing and hospitalization dramatically. Therefore, the common claim that tracing strategies are unaffordable by poorer countries is incorrect. On the contrary, it is the most adequate, both from the economic and humanitarian points of view.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Knudsen","author_inst":"Independent consultant"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Anatolyevich Kovriguine","author_inst":"Nizhny-Novgorod Technical State University n.a.

For the inverse modeling, we propose Bayesian inversion techniques, which are robust and reliable approaches, in order to estimate the unknown parameters of the epidemiological models. We use an adaptive Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the estimation of a posteriori probability distribution and confidence intervals for the unknown model parameters as well as for the reproduction number. Furthermore, we present a fatality analysis for COVID-19 in Austria, which is also of importance for governmental protective decision making. We perform our analyses on the publicly available data for Austria to estimate the main epidemiological model parameters and to study the effectiveness of the protective measures by the Austrian government. The estimated parameters and the analysis of fatalities provide useful information for decision makers and makes it possible to perform more realistic forecasts of future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leila Taghizadeh","author_inst":"Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Karimi","author_inst":"Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)"},{"author_name":"Clemens Heitzinger","author_inst":"Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)"},{"author_name":"Hoda Makhlouf","author_inst":"Assiut Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Roopa Kohli-Seth","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sanam Ahmed","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Levin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Martin D Chen","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jordi Camps","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Sant Joan de Reus"},{"author_name":"Antoni Castro","author_inst":"HUSJR"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117424","rel_title":"Evaluating the adequacy of Prima Covid-19 IgG\/IgM Rapid Test for the assessment of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117424","rel_abs":"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020 found health authorities worldwide unprepared to control the pandemic.

We first assessed the test's reproducibility by administering it twice on the same day on 104 subjects obtaining and overall score of 93 percent. Since the intensity of the color in the test line regions varies depending on the concentration of Covid-19 antibodies in each sample and that the determination of the positivity depends strictly on the subjective assessment by the reader, after excluding the subjects whose color intensity was too tenuous to be deemed unquestionably positive by the reader the reproducibility increased to 96%. The test would not perform properly for 6 subjects for a very limited overall technical failure of 0.83%. For 138 subjects information was available regarding a previous Real Time PCR nasopharyngeal swab test performed elsewhere. The correspondence of positive results between the two tests was 90.58% (125\/138).

Design: case-control study Setting: isolated rooms in the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw (which had been transformed into an infectious hospital) and a dormitory in one of Warsaw universities. Participants: 52 SARS-CoV-2 positive (51 men, mean age 21.7 years) and 36 negative students (34 men, mean age 20.8 years). Main outcome measures: a gustatory function assessment (sweet, salty, sour and bitter taste), with flavour concentrations established previously in healthy subjects was conducted for all subjects. Each participant received one tasteless reference and nine flavour tablets with sucrose concentrations of 40, 80 and 106.4 mg\/ml; NaCl at 13.5, 17 and 27 mg\/ml; ascorbic acid at 6.25 and 12.5 mg\/ml and grapefruit extract at 40 mg\/ml. Results: the only taste that was impaired significantly more frequently in COVID-19 patients was the sweet taste at the lowest flavour concentration (40 mg\/ml, p = 0.002). Different screening and diagnostic models were constructed using the examined variables. The highest accuracy screening test consisted of the positive result of a three-question questionnaire (self-reported loss of taste, self-reported loss of smell, or fever within the last month (positive if at least one present) and\/or ageusia of sweet taste at a sucrose concentration of 40 mg\/ml.

A set of newly developed Pandemic Projection Measures (PPM) had been successfully applied to project daily new cases across countries. During the development, numerous trial and error iterations had been performed and then improved with live data. The procedures and computations for the PPM including Uphill Index (UHI), Downhill Indices (DHI), and Error Band Projection (EBP) estimates were explained and discussed along with graphical projections. The PPM was computed with daily live data for the USA, four U.S. states (Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York), France, Italy, Spain, Germany, and China. The results indicated that with the PPM estimations, the daily projections for the future trend were robust to reflect the most plausibility, since the PPM can be updated frequently. With the most up-to-date predictions, governments should be able to monitor the values of UHI and DHI for making a better decision for  flattening the curve. Based on the empirical data, policymakers should pay more attentions for the following two scenarios: a) When expecting an apex of the outbreak, the UHI is higher than 1.20; and b) After passing a peak day, the DHI is still larger than 0.925. The applications of the PPM estimates are not designed for a one-time projection rather than updated frequently to improve the prediction precisions. With the same concepts from the PPM computations, the peak day and the number of new deaths could be predictable if more data are collected. Like many country leaders saying,  We will win the battle of coronavirus pandemic, the author hopes to use this easily applicable estimate method to save more lives and to win. The results, currently presented with the data on April 16 and 17, 2020, were only used to explain how to apply the PPM estimates for predictions.

Estimations of transmission parameters between compartments are typically done through stochastic parameterization processes that depend upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics, which are economically and resource-wide expensive to collect. We apply deep learning techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a customized compartmental model, for the purposes of simulating the dynamics of the US COVID-19 epidemics and projecting its further development. Methods: We construct a compartmental model. We develop a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the models transmission parameters. We then feed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict the development of the US COVID-19 epidemics for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic reproduction number (R_0) becomes less than one. Results: The deep learning-enhanced compartmental model predicts that R_0 will become less than one around June 19 to July 3, 2020, at which point the epidemics will effectively start to die out, and that the US Infected population will peak round June 18 to July 2, 2020 between 1.34 million and 1.41 million individual cases. The models also predict that the number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 2 million mark around June 10 to 11, 2020. Conclusions: Current compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate the transmission parameters. These models effectiveness depends upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics. As an alternative, deep learning techniques are effective in estimating these stochastic parameters with greatly reduced dependency on data particularity.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"QI DENG","author_inst":"Zhejiang Normal University; Cofintelligence Fintech Co.

Here, a new point-of-care approach for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection in human serum based on magnetic immuno-detection is described and compared to standard ELISA. For magnetic immuno-detection, immunofiltration columns were coated with a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide. SARS-CoV-2 peptide reactive antibodies, spiked at different concentrations into PBS and human serum, were rinsed through immunofiltration columns. Specific antibodies were retained within the IFC and labelled with an isotype specific biotinylated antibody. Streptavidin-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were applied to label the secondary antibodies. Enriched magnetic nanoparticles were then detected by means of frequency magnetic mixing detection technology, using a portable magnetic read-out device. Measuring signals corresponded to the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the sample. Our preliminary magnetic immuno-detection setup resulted in a higher sensitivity and broader detection range and was four times faster than ELISA. Further optimizations could reduce assay times to that of a typical lateral flow assay, enabling a fast and easy approach, well suited for point-of-care measurements without expensive lab equipment.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan Pietschmann","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME, Forckenbeckstrasse 6, 52074 Aachen"},{"author_name":"Nadja Voepel","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME, Forckenbeckstrasse 6, 52074 Aachen"},{"author_name":"Holger Spiegel","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME, Forckenbeckstrasse 6, 52074 Aachen"},{"author_name":"Hans-Joachim Krause","author_inst":"Institute of Biological Information Processing, Bioelectronics IBI-3, Forschungszentrum Juelich, 52428 Juelich"},{"author_name":"Florian Schroeper","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME, Forckenbeckstrasse 6, 52074 Aachen"},{"author_name":"Anjali Bararia","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Abey Thomas","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Ravi Sarode","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Andrew E Clark","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Alagarraju Muthukumar","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland, UHE Satellite Campus in Warsaw, University of Humanities and Eco"},{"author_name":"Edward Franek","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw;  Mossakowski Clinical Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.131474","rel_title":"Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses by using LAMP method with Nanopore Flongle workflow","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.131474","rel_abs":"The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a global public health emergency infected by SARC-CoV-2 has caused devastating loss around the world.

Despite this recent success, there are still several aspects related to the structure, function and dynamics of the CoV-2 polymerase that still need to be addressed. This includes understanding the dynamicity of the various polymerase subdomains, analyzing the hydrogen bond networks at the active site and at the template entry in the presence of water, studying the binding modes of the nucleotides at the active site, highlighting positions for acceptable nucleotides substitutions that can be tolerated at different positions within the nascent RNA strand, identifying possible allosteric sites within the polymerase structure and studying their correlated dynamics relative to the catalytic site. Here, we combined various cutting-edge modelling tools with the recently resolved SARS-CoV-2 cryo-EM polymerase structures to fill this gap in knowledge. Our findings provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogen bond networks at various parts of the polymerase structure and suggest possible nucleotides substitutions that can be tolerated by the polymerase complex. We also report here three \"druggable\" allosteric sites within the nsp12 RdRp that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. Our correlated motion analysis shows that the dynamics within one of the newly identified sites are linked to the active site, indicating that targeting this site can significantly impact the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khaled Barakat","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."},{"author_name":"Marawan Ahmed","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."},{"author_name":"Yasser Tabana","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."},{"author_name":"Minwoo Ha","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianhu Qin","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Tingting Yang","author_inst":"Grandomcis"},{"author_name":"Fan Liang","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Yu Liang","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Alagarraju Muthukumar","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland, UHE Satellite Campus in Warsaw, University of Humanities and Eco"},{"author_name":"Edward Franek","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw;  Mossakowski Clinical Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.131987","rel_title":"Analyzing hCov genome sequences: Applying Machine Intelligence and beyond","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.131987","rel_abs":"Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the sars-cov-2 strain of coronavirus, has affected millions of people all over the world and taken thousands of lives.

Initial data suggest that the virus has low mutation rates, but its large genome could facilitate recombination, insertions, and deletions, as has been described in other coronaviruses. Here, we deep-sequenced the complete SARS-CoV-2 S gene from 18 patients (10 with mild and 8 with severe COVID-19), and found that the virus accumulates deletions upstream and very close to the S1\/S2 cleavage site, generating a frameshift with appearance of a stop codon. These deletions were found in a small percentage of the viral quasispecies (2.2%) in samples from all the mild and only half the severe COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that the virus may generate free S1 protein released to the circulation. We propose that natural selection has favored a \"Dont burn down the house\" strategy, in which free S1 protein may compete with viral particles for the ACE2 receptor, thus reducing the severity of the infection and tissue damage without losing transmission capability.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Pinana","author_inst":"VHIR-HUVH"},{"author_name":"Francisco Rodriguez-Frias","author_inst":"VHIR-HUVH"},{"author_name":"Mercedes Guerrero","author_inst":"VHIR-HUVH"},{"author_name":"Juliana Esperalba","author_inst":"HUVH"},{"author_name":"Ariadna Rando","author_inst":"VHIR-HUVH"},{"author_name":"Lidia Goterris","author_inst":"HUVH"},{"author_name":"Maria Gema Codina","author_inst":"HUVH"},{"author_name":"Susanna Quer","author_inst":"VHIR"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Martin","author_inst":"HUVH"},{"author_name":"Magda Campins","author_inst":"HUVH"},{"author_name":"Ricard Ferrer","author_inst":"HUVH"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"HUVH"},{"author_name":"Juan Ignacio Esteban","author_inst":"VHIR-HUVH"},{"author_name":"Tomas Pumarola","author_inst":"HUVH"},{"author_name":"Andres Anton","author_inst":"VHIR-HUVH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.130591","rel_title":"Highly multiplexed oligonucleotide probe-ligation testing enables efficient extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 detection and viral genotyping","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.130591","rel_abs":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has caused the current COVID-19 pandemic with catastrophic societal impact. Because many individuals shed virus for days before symptom onset, and many show mild or no symptoms, an emergent and unprecedented need exists for development and deployment of sensitive and high throughput molecular diagnostic tests. RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing Selection and Ligation with next generation DNA sequencing (RASL-seq) is a highly multiplexed technology for targeted analysis of polyadenylated mRNA, which incorporates sample barcoding for massively parallel analyses. Here we present a more generalized method, capture RASL-seq (\u201ccRASL-seq\u201d), which enables analysis of any targeted pathogen-(and\/or host-) associated RNA molecules. cRASL-seq enables highly sensitive (down to \u223c1-100 pfu\/ml or cfu\/ml) and highly multiplexed (up to \u223c10,000 target sequences) detection of pathogens. Importantly, cRASL-seq analysis of COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens does not involve nucleic acid extraction or reverse transcription, steps that have caused testing bottlenecks associated with other assays. Our simplified workflow additionally enables the direct and efficient genotyping of selected, informative SARS-CoV-2 polymorphisms across the entire genome, which can be used for enhanced characterization of transmission chains at population scale and detection of viral clades with higher or lower virulence. Given its extremely low per-sample cost, simple and automatable protocol and analytics, probe panel modularity, and massive scalability, we propose that cRASL-seq testing is a powerful new surveillance technology with the potential to help mitigate the current pandemic and prevent similar public health crises.Competing Interest StatementJ.J.C. and H.B.L. are listed as inventors on a patent describing the cRASL-seq method.

Although SARS-CoV- 2 S is the main target of neutralizing antibodies and the focus of vaccine design, its stability and conformational dynamics are limiting factors for developing countermeasures against this virus. We report here the design of a prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer construct covalently stabilized in the closed conformation. Structural and antigenicity analysis showed we successfully shut S in the closed state without otherwise altering its architecture. Finally, we show that this engineering strategy is applicable to other {beta}-coronavirus S glycoproteins and might become an important tool for vaccine design, structural biology, serology and immunology studies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew McCallum","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alexandra C Walls","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brandon Sie","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Alexandra L Tchir","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Justin Hardick","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Xuwen Zheng","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Shaw-Saliba","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Richard Rothman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Susan Eshleman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pekosz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kasper Hansen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Heba Mostafa","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Martin Steinegger","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Harry Benjamin Larman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.130955","rel_title":"Sarbecovirus comparative genomics elucidates gene content of SARS-CoV-2 and functional impact of COVID-19 pandemic mutations","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.130955","rel_abs":"Despite its overwhelming clinical importance, the SARS-CoV-2 gene set remains unresolved, hindering dissection of COVID-19 biology. Here, we use comparative genomics to provide a high-confidence protein-coding gene set, characterize protein-level and nucleotide-level evolutionary constraint, and prioritize functional mutations from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We select 44 complete Sarbecovirus genomes at evolutionary distances ideally-suited for protein-coding and non-coding element identification, create whole-genome alignments, and quantify protein-coding evolutionary signatures and overlapping constraint. We find strong protein-coding signatures for all named genes and for 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and also ORF3c, a novel alternate-frame gene. By contrast, ORF10, and overlapping-ORFs 9c, 3b, and 3d lack protein-coding signatures or convincing experimental evidence and are not protein-coding. Furthermore, we show no other protein-coding genes remain to be discovered. Cross-strain and within-strain evolutionary pressures largely agree at the gene, amino-acid, and nucleotide levels, with some notable exceptions, including fewer-than-expected mutations in nsp3 and Spike subunit S1, and more-than-expected mutations in Nucleocapsid. The latter also shows a cluster of amino-acid-changing variants in otherwise-conserved residues in a predicted B-cell epitope, which may indicate positive selection for immune avoidance. Several Spike-protein mutations, including D614G, which has been associated with increased transmission, disrupt otherwise-perfectly-conserved amino acids, and could be novel adaptations to human hosts. The resulting high-confidence gene set and evolutionary-history annotations provide valuable resources and insights on COVID-19 biology, mutations, and evolution.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Irwin Jungreis","author_inst":"MIT; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Rachel Sealfon","author_inst":"Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Manolis Kellis","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brandon Sie","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Alexandra L Tchir","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Justin Hardick","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Xuwen Zheng","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Shaw-Saliba","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Richard Rothman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Susan Eshleman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pekosz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kasper Hansen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Heba Mostafa","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Martin Steinegger","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Harry Benjamin Larman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20107862","rel_title":"Environmental Contamination of SARS-CoV-2 in a Non-Healthcare Setting Revealed by Sensitive Nested RT-PCR","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20107862","rel_abs":"Fomite-mediated transmission has been identified as a possible route for disease spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The model assumes continuation of existing control measures such as lockdown and quarantines, the suspected and confirmed cases and does not consider the scenario of 2nd surge of the epidemic due to any reason. The model is arrived after least square fitting of epidemic behaviour model based on theoretical formulation to the real data of cumulative infection cases reported between 24 March 2020 and 15 May 2020. The predictive capability of the model has been validated with real data of infection cases reported during May 15-30, 2020. A detailed analysis of model predictions in terms of future trend of COVID-19 progress individually in 18 states of India and India as a whole has been attempted. Infection rate in India as a whole is continuously decreasing with time and has reached 3 times lower than the initial infection rate after 6 weeks of lock down suggesting the effectiveness of the lockdown in containing the epidemic. Results suggest that India as a whole could see the peak and end of the epidemic in the month of July 2020 and January 2021. As per the current trend in the data, active infected cases in India may reach 2 lakhs at the peak time and total infected cases may reach around 14 lakhs. State-wise results have been discussed in the manuscript. However, the prediction may deviate particularly for longer dates, as assumptions of model cannot be met always in a real scenario. In view of this, a real time application (COV-IND Predictor) has been developed which automatically syncs the latest data from COVID19 dash board on daily basis and update the model input parameters and predictions of relevant results on daily basis.
