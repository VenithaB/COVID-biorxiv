We estimated the number of cancelled surgical procedures in the National Health Service (NHS) in England due to COVID-19 and how this deficit would change over time once elective surgery was reintroduced. Methods: Modelling study using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data from 2014 to 2019. Using NHS England definitions, surgical procedures were grouped into four classes of urgency. We calculated time-weighted average numbers of surgical procedures from 1st March 2020 and extrapolated to 28th February 2021 informed by activity in previous years. We estimated the procedure deficit using multiple conservative assumptions and then modelled the reintroduction of elective surgery between 1st June 2020 and 28th February 2021, estimating the resources required to achieve this. Costs of surgery were calculated using NHS reference costs. Estimates are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Findings: 4,547,534 (3,318,195 - 6,250,771) patients with pooled mean age of 53.5 years were expected to undergo surgery in the NHS in England between 1st March 2020 and 28th February 2021. Due to COVID-19, 749,248 (513,565 - 1,077,448) surgical procedures were cancelled by 31st May 2020. As current guidelines require a gradual reintroduction of elective surgery, this deficit will increase further and 2,270,178 (1,453,057 - 3,363,472) patients will be awaiting surgery by 28th February 2021. The cost of these delayed procedures is {pound}4,688,318,443 ({pound}2,726,364,240 - {pound}7,070,166,056). However, the safe delivery of surgery during the pandemic will require substantial extra resources including personal protective equipment and universal preoperative screening, leading to additional costs of {pound}606,252,901 ({pound}521,159,931 - {pound}730,720,808). Interpretation: Reintroduction of elective surgery during the pandemic response in NHS England will be associated with substantial treatment delays for many patients, and a large increase in treatment costs.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander J Fowler","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, UK"},{"author_name":"Tom D Dobbs","author_inst":"Reconstructive Surgery & Regenerative Medicine Research Group, Institute of Life Sciences, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea, UK"},{"author_name":"Yize I Wan","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK."},{"author_name":"Ryan Laloo","author_inst":"Leeds Vascular Institute, Leeds General Infirmary, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hui","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK"},{"author_name":"Dmitri Nepogodiev","author_inst":"Academic Department of Surgery, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Aneel Bhangu","author_inst":"Academic Department of Surgery, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Iain Whitaker","author_inst":"Reconstructive Surgery & Regenerative Medicine Research Group, Institute of Life Sciences, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea, UK"},{"author_name":"Rupert M Pearse","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK."},{"author_name":"Tom EF Abbott","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"surgery"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20127290","rel_title":"Priority Setting of Ventilators in the COVID-19 Pandemic from the public's perspective","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20127290","rel_abs":"Background: Ventilator allocation plan for public health crisis should be developed through recognizing the values of society and engaging the general public. This study was conducted to assess the Iranian citizens' attitude about a number of principles and criteria for allocation of ventilators in current COVID-19 epidemic. Materials and Methods: An electronic self-administered questionnaire was publicly distributed through social networks of Telegram and WhatsApp to perform this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire consisted of 11 statements about the selection and prioritization of patients for the use of a ventilator. Results: 1262 persons, including 767 citizens and 495 health care providers participated in this study. More than 95% of participants agreed upon the necessity to avoid discrimination and avoid prioritization according to patients' gender, economic and political status. While 40.9% of citizens and 49.6% of healthcare workers believed that a ventilator can be disconnected from a patient with a poor prognosis to help a patient who has a better prognosis (P-value=0.13), 34.3% of people and 29.6% of healthcare workers believed that the earlier admitted patients have the right to receive the device even if the likeliness of his\/her survival is less than the next patient (P-value=0.009). Conclusions: This study showed that people accept maximizing health benefits as a measure of ventilator allocation in the pandemic of COVID-19. At the same time, periodic evaluation of patients and disconnecting the device from a patient that no longer benefits from ICU services require its scientific and ethical basis to be brought in public discourse.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fariba Asghari","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Parsapour","author_inst":"Medical Ethics and History of Medicine Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Shamsi Gooshki","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Medical Ethics and History of Medicine Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ryan Laloo","author_inst":"Leeds Vascular Institute, Leeds General Infirmary, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hui","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK"},{"author_name":"Dmitri Nepogodiev","author_inst":"Academic Department of Surgery, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Aneel Bhangu","author_inst":"Academic Department of Surgery, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Iain Whitaker","author_inst":"Reconstructive Surgery & Regenerative Medicine Research Group, Institute of Life Sciences, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea, UK"},{"author_name":"Rupert M Pearse","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK."},{"author_name":"Tom EF Abbott","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical ethics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20127225","rel_title":"Identifying and Ranking Common COVID-19 Symptoms from Arabic Twitter","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20127225","rel_abs":"Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the most common symptoms reported by covid-19 patients in the Arabic language and order the symptoms appearance based on the collected data. Methods: We search the Arabic content of Twitter for personal reports of covid-19 symptoms from March 1st to May 27th, 2020. We identify 463 Arabic users who tweeted testing positive for covid-19 and extract the symptoms they publicly associate with covid-19. Furthermore, we ask them directly through personal messages to opt in and rank the appearance of the first three symptoms they experienced right before (or after) diagnosed with covid-19. Finally, we track their Twitter timeline to identify additional symptoms that were mentioned within +-5 days from the day of tweeting having covid-19. In summary, a list of 270 covid-19 reports were collected and symptoms were (at least partially) ranked from early to late. Results: The collected reports contained roughly 900 symptoms originated from 74% (n=201) male and 26% (n=69) female Twitter users. The majority (82%) of the tracked users were living in Saudi Arabia (46%) and Kuwait (36%). Furthermore, 13% (n=36) of the collected reports were asymptomatic. Out of the users with symptoms (n=234), 66% (n=180) provided a chronological order of appearance for at least three symptoms. Fever 59% (n=139), Headache 43% (n=101), and Anosmia 39% (n=91) were found to be the top three symptoms mentioned by the reports.

Now, the debates remain on whether, vertical transmission of Severe Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and antibodies against the virus do exist. We therefore, conducted a systematic review to determine the immunoglobulin G and M (IgG\/IgM) levels among infants born to mothers with COVID-19. Methods The systematic search was done using PubMed\/MEDLINE and Google Scholar database. The research included studies on IgG\/ IgM against SARS-CoV-2 among infants born to mother with COVID-19 published in English from December 1, 2019 onwards. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) guidelines. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and performed two tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to determine and compare the median IgG\/IgM levels. Results In total, 486 abstracts were screened and 63 full-text articles were assessed. Of 63 articles, 6 met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis. Two articles were included in quantitative analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/ IgM levels. The median antibody levels was 75.49AU\/mL (range: 7.25AU\/mL- 140.32AU\/mL ) and for 3.79AU\/mL (range: 0.16AU\/mL-45.83AU\/mL) (P = 0.0041) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, respectively. Conclusion There were high levels of IgG but low IgM against SARS-CoV-2 (using <10 AU\/mL as a reference range) among COVID-19 virus exposed but negative newborns. This review suggest a possible natural passive immunity (IgG\/ IgM) against COVID-19 virus.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George M.

Methods: An agent-based model, Covasim, was calibrated to the local COVID-19 epidemiological and policy environment. Contact networks were modelled to capture transmission risks in households, schools and workplaces, and a variety of community spaces (e.g. public transport, parks, bars, cafes\/restaurants) and activities (e.g. community or professional sports, large events). Policy changes that could prevent or reduce transmission in specific locations (e.g. opening\/closing businesses) were modelled in the context of interventions that included testing, contact tracing (including via a smartphone app), and quarantine. Results: Policy changes leading to the gathering of large, unstructured groups with unknown individuals (e.g. bars opening, increased public transport use) posed the greatest risk, while policy changes leading to smaller, structured gatherings with known individuals (e.g. small social gatherings) posed least risk. In the model, epidemic impact following some policy changes took more than two months to occur. Model outcomes support continuation of working from home policies to reduce public transport use, and risk mitigation strategies in the context of social venues opening, such as >30% population-uptake of a contact-tracing app, physical distancing policies within venues reducing transmissibility by >40%, or patron identification records being kept to enable >60% contact tracing. Conclusions: In a low transmission setting, care should be taken to avoid lifting sequential COVID-19 policy restrictions within short time periods, as it could take more than two months to detect the consequences of any changes. These findings have implications for other settings with low community transmission where governments are beginning to lift restrictions.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nick Scott","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Palmer","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Dominic Delport","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Romesh Abeysuriya","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Robyn Stuart","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Cliff C Kerr","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Dina Mistry","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Klein","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Rachel Sacks-Davis","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Katie Heath","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Samuel Hainsworth","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Alisa Pedrana","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark Stoove","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"David P Wilson","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Margaret Hellard","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20126359","rel_title":"Chemoprophylaxis of COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine: Astudy of health care workers attitude, adherence to regimeand side effects","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20126359","rel_abs":"Background: There are apprehensions amongst healthcare worker (HCWs) about COVID-19.

Observational studies to date lack pre-specification, transparency, rigorous ascertainment adjustment and international generalizability, with contradictory results. Methods: Using electronic health records from Spain (SIDIAP) and the United States (Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Department of Veterans Affairs), we conducted a systematic cohort study with prevalent ACE, ARB, calcium channel blocker (CCB) and thiazide diuretic (THZ) use to determine relative risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and related hospitalization outcomes. The study addressed confounding through large-scale propensity score adjustment and negative control experiments. Results: Following over 1.1 million antihypertensive users identified between November 2019 and January 2020, we observed no significant difference in relative COVID-19 diagnosis risk comparing ACE\/ARB vs CCB\/THZ monotherapy (hazard ratio: 0.98; 95% CI 0.84 - 1.14), nor any difference for mono\/combination use (1.01; 0.90 - 1.15). ACE alone and ARB alone similarly showed no relative risk difference when compared to CCB\/THZ monotherapy or mono\/combination use. Directly comparing ACE vs. ARB demonstrated a moderately lower risk with ACE, non-significant for monotherapy (0.85; 0.69 - 1.05) and marginally significant for mono\/combination users (0.88; 0.79 - 0.99). We observed, however, no significant difference between drug- classes for COVID-19 hospitalization or pneumonia risk across all comparisons. Conclusion: There is no clinically significant increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or hospitalization with ACE or ARB use.

By bounding the hospitalization capacity, we are able to study in detail the interplay between mobility and hospitalization capacity.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tomas Veloz","author_inst":"Fundacion para el Desarrollo Interdisciplinario de la Ciencia la Tecnologia y la Artes"},{"author_name":"pedro maldonado","author_inst":"fundacion para el desarrollo interdisciplinario de la ciencia la tecnologia y las artes"},{"author_name":"samuel ropert","author_inst":"fundacion para el desarrollo interdisciplinario de la ciencia la tecnologia y las artes"},{"author_name":"cesar ravello","author_inst":"Fundacion Ciencia y vida"},{"author_name":"alejandra barrios","author_inst":"fundacion ciencia y vida"},{"author_name":"soraya mora","author_inst":"Fundacion Ciencia y vida"},{"author_name":"Cesar Valdenegro","author_inst":"Fundacion Ciencia y Vida"},{"author_name":"Tomas Villaseca","author_inst":"Fundacion Ciencia y Vida"},{"author_name":"Tomas Perez-Acle","author_inst":"Fundacion Ciencia y Vida"},{"author_name":"Kristine Lynch","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs"},{"author_name":"Thomas Falconer","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Kees van Bochove","author_inst":"The Hyve"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Sung","author_inst":"Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael E.

However, prior research primarily focuses on individual LTCs and there is a lack of data on the influence of multimorbidity ([&ge;]2 LTCs) on the risk of COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity, more detailed understanding of the associations with multimorbidity and COVID-19 would improve risk stratification and help protect those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Here we examine the relationships between multimorbidity, polypharmacy (a proxy of multimorbidity), and COVID-19; and how these differ by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological prognostic factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied data from UK Biobank (428,199 participants; aged 37-73; recruited 2006-2010) on self-reported LTCs, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological measures which were linked to COVID-19 test data. Poisson regression models examined risk of COVID-19 by multimorbidity\/polypharmacy and effect modification by COVID-19 prognostic factors (age\/sex\/ethnicity\/socioeconomic status\/smoking\/physical activity\/BMI\/systolic blood pressure\/renal function). 4,498 (1.05%) participants were tested; 1,324 (0.31%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared with no LTCs, relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in those with 1 LTC was no higher (RR 1.12 (CI 0.96-1.30)), whereas those with [&ge;]2 LTCs had 48% higher risk; RR 1.48 (1.28-1.71). Compared with no cardiometabolic LTCs, having 1 and [&ge;]2 cardiometabolic LTCs had a higher risk of COVID-19; RR 1.28 (1.12-1.46) and 1.77 (1.46-2.15), respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with a dose response increased risk of COVID-19. All prognostic factors were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in multimorbidity; being non-white, most socioeconomically deprived, BMI [&ge;]40 kg\/m2, and reduced renal function were associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection: RR 2.81 (2.09-3.78); 2.79 (2.00-3.90); 2.66 (1.88-3.76); 2.13 (1.46-3.12), respectively. No multiplicative interaction between multimorbidity and prognostic factors was identified. Important limitations include the low proportion of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 test data (1.05%) and UK Biobank participants being more affluent, healthier and less ethnically diverse than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing multimorbidity, especially cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and polypharmacy are associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Those with multimorbidity and additional factors, such as non-white ethnicity, are at heightened risk of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ross McQueenie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Instutute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Hamish Foster","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Instutute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Naveed Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Claire L Niedzwiedz","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Claire E Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Jana Anderson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Patrick B Mark","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Michael Sullivan","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Christophe G.

Methods: Prospective analysis of registry data describing patients admitted to five acute NHS Hospitals in east London, UK for COVID-19. Emergency hospital admissions with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 aged 16 years or over were included. Data, including ethnicity, social deprivation, frailty, patient care and detailed risk factors for mortality, were extracted from hospital electronic records. Multivariable survival analysis was used to assess associations between ethnic group and mortality accounting for the effects of age, sex and various other risk factors. Results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Findings: 1996 adult patients were admitted between 1st March and 13th May 2020. After excluding 259 patients with missing ethnicity data, 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) Black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared to white patients, those from BAME backgrounds were younger, with differing co-morbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to intensive care and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, [1.06-2.23]; p=0.023 and 1.80 [1.20-2.71]; p=0.005, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian (HR 1.49 [1.19-1.86]; p<0.001) and black (HR 1.30 [1.02-1.65]; p=0.036) backgrounds were more likely to die. These findings persisted across a range of risk-factor adjusted analyses. Interpretation: Patients from Asian and Black backgrounds are more likely to die from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders. Higher rates of invasive ventilation in intensive care indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and Black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vanessa J Apea","author_inst":"Department of Infection and Immunity, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust; Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Yize I Wan","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Rageshri Dhairyawan","author_inst":"Department of Infection and Immunity, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust; Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Zudin A Puthucheary","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Rupert M Pearse","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Chloe M Orkin","author_inst":"Department of Infection and Immunity, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust; Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"John R Prowle","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Claire L Niedzwiedz","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Claire E Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Jana Anderson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Patrick B Mark","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Michael Sullivan","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Christophe G.

In this quasi-experimental study, we modelled the temporal trends in human mobility and epidemics of COVID-19 in the 27 EU states between January 15 and May 9, 2020. COVID-19 and human mobility had 3 trend-segments, including an upward trend in COVID-19 daily incidence and a downward trend in most human mobilities in the middle segment. Compared with the EU states farther from Italy, the state-wide lockdown dates were more likely linked to turning points of human mobilities in the EU states closer to Italy, which were also more likely linked to second turning points of COVID-19 epidemics. Among the examined human mobilities, the second turning points in driving mobility and the first turning points in parks mobility were the best factors that connected lockdown dates and COVID-19 epidemics in the EU states closer to Italy.

Studies have suggested that there is a direct relationship between environmental issues and population density with cases of COVID-19. In this sense, this research aims to analyze, through correlational study and Krigagem, the relationship of meteorological and demographic variables with cases of COVID-19 in regions of subtropical climate in Brazil. The results suggest that population and demographic density (hab\/km2) are risk factors for the spread of SAR-CoV-2 and an increase in the daily case record of COVID-19. The distribution of cases according to age group did not present a significant disparity between men and women. Relative humidity (RH)%, average temperature Celsius, minimum temperature Celsius, maximum temperature Celsius, wind speed m\/s and daily precipitation (rain) mm show negative relationships with cases of COVID-19 in regions of humid equatorial climate. Analysis between associations of environmental factors, wind, temperature and HR in a region is extremely important to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. In the northern region of Brazil, low wind speed, high temperatures and high RH are observed, environmental factors that, when associated, reduce the transmission process because it hinders the movement of the virus in the environment. In this sense, it is suggested that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in this region is disseminated through fluids in the air between man\/man and by contact between objects\/men. Therefore, strategic public policies to combat the pandemic must consider the environmental factors of the regions involved and control and\/or blocking the transit of people.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felix Lelis da Silva","author_inst":"Federal Institute of Education Science and Tecnology of Par"},{"author_name":"Maryjane Diniz A.

Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, we found that the unitary state system was counter-intuitively positively associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Blood type B was a protective factor for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV, influenza and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Obesity and the condition of unimproved water sources were associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, and vitamin D intake.

To date, there are few empirical estimates of IFR published due to challenges in measuring infection rates. Outside of closed, closely surveilled populations where infection rates can be monitored through viral surveillance, we must rely on indirect measures of infection, like specific antibodies. Representative seroprevalence studies provide an important avenue for estimating the number of infections in a community, and when combined with death counts can lead to robust estimates of the IFR. We estimated overall and age-specific IFR for the canton of Geneva, Switzerland using age-stratified daily case and death incidence reports combined with five weekly population-based seroprevalence estimates. From February 24th to June 2nd there were 5'039 confirmed cases and 286 reported deaths within Geneva (population of 506'765). We inferred age-stratified (5-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-65 and 65+) IFRs by linking the observed number of deaths to the estimated number of infected individuals from each serosurvey. We account for the delays between infection and seroconversion as well as between infection and death. Inference is drawn in a Bayesian framework that incorporates uncertainty in seroprevalence estimates (supplement). Of the 286 reported deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, the youngest person to die was 31 years old. Infected individuals younger than 50 years experienced statistically similar IFRs (range 0.00032-0.0016%), which increases to 0.14% (95% CrI 0.096-0.19) for those 50-64 years old to 5.6% (95% CrI 4.3-7.4) for those 65 years and older (supplement). After accounting for demography and age-specific seroprevalence, we estimate a population-wide IFR of 0.64% (95% CrI 0.38-0.98). Our results are subject to two notable limitations. Among the 65+ age group that died of COVID-19 within Geneva, 50% were reported among residents of assisted care facilities, where around 0.8% of the Geneva population resides. While the serosurvey protocol did not explicitly exclude these individuals, they are likely to have been under-represented. This would lead to an overestimation of the IFR in the 65+ age group if seroprevalence in this institutionalized population was higher than in the general population (supplement). Further, our IFR estimates are based on current evidence regarding post-infection antibody kinetics, which may differ between severe and mild infections. If mild infections have significantly lower and short-lived antibody responses, our estimates of IFR may be biased upwards. Estimates of IFR are key for understanding the true pandemic burden and for weighing different risk reduction strategies. The IFR is not solely determined by host and pathogen biology, but also by the capacity of health systems to treat severe cases. Despite having among the highest per capita incidence in Switzerland, Geneva's health system accommodated the influx of cases needing intensive care (peak of 80\/110 ICU-beds including surge capacity) while maintaining care quality standards. As such, our IFR estimates can be seen as a best-case scenario with respect to health system capacity. Our results reveal that population-wide estimates of IFR mask great heterogeneity by age and point towards the importance of age-targeted interventions to reduce exposures among those at highest risk of death.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier Perez-Saez","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Lauer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Simon Regard","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Delaporte","author_inst":"General Directorate for Health, Geneva"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"- Serocov-POP Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Cai Chen","author_inst":"University of California"},{"author_name":"Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Pinghu hospital of Shenzhen university"},{"author_name":"Xiaosheng Wang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Christophe G.

However, social distancing rules have put the use of public spaces in densely populated places under strain, and this is especially important as some of the most virulent outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic have been in compact cities. It is therefore fundamental to take into account each neighbourhood's morphological characteristics and the potential population densities each street, square or park can accommodate under such new regulations in order to effectively enforce social distancing rules. Otherwise, certain areas may be rapidly overwhelmed by crowds with citizens unable to maintain the minimum safe distance between individuals. In this paper, we develop a method to identify the potential public space accessibility if social distancing rules are followed and we apply it to three global and highly affected by COVID-19 cities. Our research finds that, at micro level there are important inequalities between neighbourhoods, so people will struggle to comply with social distancing rules and consequently it will make controlling infection rates more difficult.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandre Nobajas","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Joan Ganau i Casas","author_inst":"Universitat de Lleida"},{"author_name":"Daniel Paul i Agusti","author_inst":"Universitat de Lleida"},{"author_name":"Adam J Peacock","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Delaporte","author_inst":"General Directorate for Health, Geneva"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"- Serocov-POP Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Cai Chen","author_inst":"University of California"},{"author_name":"Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Pinghu hospital of Shenzhen university"},{"author_name":"Xiaosheng Wang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Christophe G.

Objective To determine whether it is feasible and safe to continue non-emergency surgery in the COVID-19 pandemic Design, setting and participants This is a cohort study of 500 consecutive patients undergoing non-emergency surgery in a dedicated COVID-19 cold site following the first case of COVID-19 that was reported in the institution. The study was carried out during the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom, which currently has one of the highest number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 globally. We set up a hub-and-spoke surgical network amongst 14 National Health Service institutions during the pandemic. The hub was a cancer centre, which was converted into a COVID-19 cold site, performing urological, thoracic, gynaecological and general surgical operations. Outcomes The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and post-operative complications at 30-days. Results 500 patients underwent surgery with median age 62.5 (IQR 51-71). 65% were male and 60% had a known diagnosis of cancer. 44% of surgeries were performed with robotic or laparoscopic assistance and 61% were considered complex or major operations. None of the 500 patients undergoing surgery died from COVID-19 at 30-days. 30-day all-cause mortality was 3\/500 (1%). 10 (2%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 4 (1%) with confirmed laboratory diagnosis and 6 (1%) with probable COVID-19. 33\/500 (7%) of patients developed Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher complications, with 1\/33 (3%) occurring in a patient with COVID-19. Conclusion It is safe to continue non-emergency surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic with appropriate service reconfiguration.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veeru Kasivisvanathan","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lindsay","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sara Rakhshani-moghadam","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Elhamshary","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Kapriniotis","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Georgios Kazantzis","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bilal Syed","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"John Hines","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Axel Bex","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Daniel Heffernan Ho","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin Hayward","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chetan Bhan","author_inst":"Whittington Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicola MacDonald","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Clarke","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"David Walker","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Bellingan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Moore","author_inst":"NHS England and NHS Improvement"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Rohn","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Asif Muneer","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lois Roberts","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fares Haddad","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"John D Kelly","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter R.

Here we analyze viral genome sequences using a phylodynamic model with geographic structure to estimate the origin and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe prior to border closures. Based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reconstruct a partial transmission tree of the early pandemic, including inferences of the geographic location of ancestral lineages and the number of migration events into and between European regions. We find that the predominant lineage spreading in Europe has a most recent common ancestor in Italy and was probably seeded by a transmission event in either Hubei or Germany. We do not find evidence for preferential migration paths from Hubei into different European regions or from each European region to the others. Sustained local transmission is first evident in Italy and then shortly thereafter in the other European regions considered. Before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate that the rate of occurrence of new cases from within-country transmission was within the bounds of the estimated rate of new cases from migration. In summary, our analysis offers a view on the early state of the epidemic in Europe and on migration patterns of the virus before border closures.

This detection can remain positive for weeks without implying virus viability. Methods: We have performed cell culture to assess viral replication in 106 respiratory samples rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 105 patients with COVID-19. Fifty were samples from 50 patients with mild forms of COVID-19 who did not require hospital admission. Fifty-six samples were obtained from 55 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia. Samples were obtained at different time points covering the time from clinical diagnosis to the follow up during hospital care. Results: In 49 samples (49\/106, 46.2%) a cytopathic effect (CPE) was detected in cell culture. Our study demonstrates that while in patients with mild COVID-19, viral viability is maintained in fact up to 10 days in patients with severe COVID-19 the virus can remain viable for up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms. Patients with severe COVID-19 as compared with mild cases, presented infective virus in a significantly higher proportion in samples with moderate or low viral load (Ct value > 26): 22\/46 (47.8%) versus 7\/38 (18.4%), (p <0.01), respectively. Conclusions: Persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication could be demonstrated in severe COVID-19 cases for periods up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms and even at high Ct values. COVID-19 severity is a more determining factor for viral viability than the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms or the Ct value obtained in the RT-PCR assay.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Dolores Folgueira","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Joanna Luczkowiak","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigacion Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Fatima Lasala","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigacion Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Perez-Rivilla","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Rafael Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Georgios Kazantzis","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bilal Syed","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"John Hines","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Axel Bex","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Daniel Heffernan Ho","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin Hayward","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chetan Bhan","author_inst":"Whittington Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicola MacDonald","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Clarke","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"David Walker","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Bellingan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Moore","author_inst":"NHS England and NHS Improvement"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Rohn","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Asif Muneer","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lois Roberts","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fares Haddad","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"John D Kelly","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter R.

With this rationale, we used lenzilumab, an anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, to treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and risk factors for poor outcomes were treated with lenzilumab 600 mg intravenously for three doses through an emergency single-use IND application. Patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory outcomes, and adverse events were recorded. All patients receiving lenzilumab through May 1, 2020 were included in this report. Results: Twelve patients were treated with lenzilumab. Clinical improvement was observed in 11 out of 12 (92%), with a median time to discharge of 5 days. There was a significant improvement in oxygenation: The proportion of patients with SpO2\/FiO2 < 315 at the end of observation was 8% vs. compared to 67% at baseline (p=0.00015). A significant improvement in mean CRP and IL-6 values on day 3 following lenzilumab administration was also observed (137.3 mg\/L vs 51.2 mg\/L, p = 0.040; 26.8 pg\/mL vs 16.1 pg\/mL, p = 0.035; respectively). Cytokine analysis showed a reduction in inflammatory myeloid cells two days after lenzilumab treatment. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events attributable to lenzilumab, and no mortality in this cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions: In high-risk COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab was safe and associated with improved clinical outcomes, oxygen requirement, and cytokine storm.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zelalem Temesgen","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN"},{"author_name":"Mariam Assi","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN"},{"author_name":"Paschalis Vergidis","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN"},{"author_name":"Stacey A.

Self-collection of diagnostic specimens at home offers an avenue to allow people to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or immune response without traveling to a clinic or laboratory. Before this study, survey respondents indicated willingness to self-collect specimens for COVID-related tests, but hypothetical willingness can differ from post-collection acceptability after participants collect specimens. Methods: 153 US adults were enrolled in a study of the willingness and feasibility of patients to self-collect three diagnostic specimens (saliva, oropharyngeal swab (OPS) and dried blood spot (DBS) card) while observed by a clinician through a telehealth session. After the specimens were collected, 148 participants participated in a survey about the acceptability of the collection, packing and shipping process, and their confidence in the samples collected for COVID-related laboratory testing. Results: A large majority of participants (>84%) reported that collecting, packing and shipping of saliva, OPS, and DBS specimens were acceptable. Nearly nine in 10 (87%) reported being confident or very confident that the specimens they collected were sufficient for laboratory analysis. There were no differences in acceptability for any specimen type, packing and shipping, or confidence in samples by gender, age, race\/ethnicity, or educational level. Conclusions: Self-collection of specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing and preparing and shipping specimens for analysis were acceptable in a diverse group of US adults. Further refinement of materials and instructions to support self-collection of saliva, OPS and DBS specimens for COVID-related testing is needed.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mariah Valentine-Graves","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Eric Hall","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jodie Lynn Guest","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Adam","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Rachel Valencia","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Hardee","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kaitlin Shinn","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Travis Howard Sanchez","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Aaron J Siegler","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Patrick S Sullivan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Hugo E.

The role of smoking is still controversial. Objective: To evaluate the rate of daily smokers in patients with COVID-19. Methods: COVID-19 in-and outpatients from a large French university hospital were systematically interviewed for their smoking status, use of e-cigarette and nicotinic substitutes. The rates of daily smokers in in-and outpatients were compared to those in the 2019 French general population, after standardization for sex and age. Results: The inpatient group was composed of 340 patients, median age 66 years: 203 men (59.7%) and 137 women (40.3%), median age for both 66 years, with a daily smokers rate of 4.1 % CI95% [2.3-6.9] (5.4% of men, 2.2% of women).

An assessment of mortality relative to mortality in the general population is presented. Design: Retrospective population-based study. Setting: Individual information on symptomatic confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients and subsequent deaths from any cause were compared to the all-cause mortality in the Swiss population of 2018. Starting February 23, 2020, mortality in covid-19 patients was monitored for 80 days and compared to the population mortality observed in the same time-of-year starting February 23, 2018. Participants: 5 160 595 inhabitants of Switzerland aged 35 to 95 without covid-19 (general population in spring 2018) and 20 769 persons tested positively for covid-19 (spring 2020). Measurements: Sex- and age-specific mortality rates were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Absolute probabilities of death were predicted and risk was assessed in terms of relative mortality by taking the ratio between the sex- and age-specific absolute mortality in covid19 patients and the corresponding mortality in the 2018 general population. Results: A confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased the probability of death across all patient groups, ranging from nine (6 to 15) times the population mortality in 35-year old infected females to a 53-fold increase (46 to 59) for 95 year old infected males. The highest relative risks were observed among males and older patients. The magnitude of these effects was smaller compared to increases observed in absolute mortality risk. Male covid-19 patients exceeded the population hazard for males (hazard ratio 1.20, 1.00 to 1.44). Each additional year of age increased the population hazard in covid-19 patients (hazard ratio 1.04, 1.03 to 1.05). Limitations: Information about the distribution of relevant comorbidities was not available on population level and the associated risk was not quantified. Conclusions: Health care professionals, decision makers, and societies are provided with an additional population-adjusted assessment of covid-19 mortality risk. In combination with absolute measures of risk, the relative risks presented here help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the actual impact of covid-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Torsten Hothorn","author_inst":"Universitaet Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Matthias Bopp","author_inst":"Universitaet Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Huldrych F Guenthard","author_inst":"Universitaetsspital Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Olivia Keiser","author_inst":"Universite de Geneve"},{"author_name":"Maroussia Roelens","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Weibull","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Michael J Crowther","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Elise Morawiec","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Pierre Hausfater","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Alain Combes","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Thomas Similowski","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Dale Chappell","author_inst":"Humanigen, Inc.

The complex and multi level pathophysiological patterns of most diseases require a systemic medicine approach and are challenging current medical therapies. Computational medicine is a vibrant interdisciplinary field that could help moving from an organ-centered to a process-oriented or systemic medicine data analysis. The resulting Computational patient may require an international interdisciplinary effort, probably of larger scientific and technological interdisciplinarity than the human genome sequencing. When deployed, it will have a profound impact on how healthcare is delivered to patients. Here we present a Computational patient model that integrates, refine and extend recent specific mechanistic or phenomenological models of cardiovascular, RAS and diabetic processes. Our aim is twofold: analyse the modularity and composability of the models-building blocks of the Computational patient and to study the dynamical properties of well-being and disease states in a broader functional context. We present results from a number of experiments among which we characterise the dynamical impact of covid-19 and T2D diabetes on cardiovascular and inflammation conditions. We tested these experiments under exercise and meals and drug regimen. We report results showing the striking importance of transient dynamical responses to acute state conditions and we provide guidelines for system design principle of the inter-relationship between modules and components for systemic medicine. Finally this initial Computational Patient can be used as a toolbox for further modifications and extensions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pietro Barbiero","author_inst":"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Pietro Li\u00f3","author_inst":"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Huldrych F Guenthard","author_inst":"Universitaetsspital Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Olivia Keiser","author_inst":"Universite de Geneve"},{"author_name":"Maroussia Roelens","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Weibull","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Michael J Crowther","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Elise Morawiec","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Pierre Hausfater","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Alain Combes","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Thomas Similowski","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Dale Chappell","author_inst":"Humanigen, Inc.

On March 18, 2020, Para notified the first case of COVID-19. After seven weeks, the number of confirmed cases reached 4,756 with 375 deaths. Knowing that infected people may be asymptomatic, the disease symptomatology absence and the population's neglect of isolation influence the spread, and factors such as chronic pneumonia, high age, obesity, chronic kidney diseases and other comorbidities favor the mortality rate. On the other hand, social isolation, quarantine and lockdown seek to contain the intraregional contagion advance. This study analyzes the dynamics of COVID-19 new cases advance among municipalities in the state of Para, Brazil. The results show it took 49 days for 81% of the state's municipalities to register COVID-19 cases. The association between social isolation, quarantine and lockdown as an action to contain the infection was effective in reducing the region's new cases registration of COVID-19 in the short-term.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"F\u00e9lix L\u00e9lis da Silva","author_inst":"Federal Institute of Education Science and Tecnology of Par\u00e1"},{"author_name":"Javier Dias Pita","author_inst":"Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Par\u00e1"},{"author_name":"Maryjane Diniz Ara\u00fajo Gomes","author_inst":"Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Par\u00e1"},{"author_name":"Andr\u00e9a Pereira L\u00e9lis da Silva","author_inst":"Metropolitan Regional Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gabriel L\u00e9lis P. da Silva","author_inst":"Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 College of Castanhal"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Weibull","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Michael J Crowther","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Elise Morawiec","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Pierre Hausfater","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Alain Combes","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Thomas Similowski","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Dale Chappell","author_inst":"Humanigen, Inc.
