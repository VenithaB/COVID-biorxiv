Nationwide lockdown has been imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 outbreak in India, which could have psychological impact on the population. Aim: Our study aims to study the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak & subsequent lockdown on mental health status of adult Indian population along with identifying the high-risk groups. Methodology: An online survey was conducted during 3rd phase of lockdown gathering details about sociodemographic variables, practice of precautionary measures, awareness and concerns regarding COVID-19 and mental health status of the participants through DASS21 questionnaire from 873 adults. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress were 18.56%, 25.66%, and 21.99% respectively including higher number of participants with mild depression (15.1%) and stress (14.5%) and moderate anxiety (16.3%). Female gender, age <25 years, unemployment, self-business, employed in private sector, lack of formal education, larger household size, parenthood (>2 kids) were associated with increased likelihood of negative mental health. Confidence in physician's ability to diagnose COVID-19 infection, decreased self-perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19, lesser frequency of checking for information on COVID-19 and satisfaction of information received were protective against negative mental health. Conclusion: This landmark study identified the protective and risk factors of mental health during COVID-19 pandemic, to help authorities and mental health workers to strategize and deliver interventional methods to maintain psychosocial wellbeing of the population.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jayakumar Saikarthik","author_inst":"Majmaah University"},{"author_name":"Ilango Saraswathi","author_inst":"Madha Medical College and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Thirusangu Siva","author_inst":"Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Centre"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130054","rel_title":"What triggers online help-seeking retransmission during the COVID-19 period?

Limited by medical resources shortage and uneven facilities distribution, online help-seeking becomes an essential approach to cope with public health emergencies for many ordinaries. This study explores the driving forces behind the retransmission of online help-seeking posts. We built an analytical framework that emphasized content characteristics, including information completeness, proximity, support seeking type, disease severity, and emotion of help-seeking messages. A quantitative content analysis was conducted with a probability sample consisting of 727 posts. The results illustrate the importance of individual information completeness, high proximity, instrumental support seeking. This study also demonstrates slight inconformity with the severity principle but stresses the power of anger in help-seeking messages dissemination. As one of the first online help-seeking diffusion analyses in the COVID-19 period, our research provides a reference for constructing compelling and effective help-seeking posts during a particular period. It also reveals further possibilities for harnessing social media's power to promote reciprocal and cooperative actions as a response to this deepening global concern.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen Luo","author_inst":"School of Journalism and Communication, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yuru Li","author_inst":"Center for Media, Communication and Information Research, University of Bremen"},{"author_name":"Anfan Chen","author_inst":"School of Humanity and Social Science, University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yulong Tang","author_inst":"Institute of Communication Studies, Communication University of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130062","rel_title":"Guillain Barr e syndrome in COVID-19:A scoping review","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130062","rel_abs":"Introduction The novel coronavirus (COVID19) can result in several neurological complications. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is one of them and has been reported from different parts of the world in this pandemic. It is an acute post-infectious polyneuropathy. The review aims to summarize the demographic features, clinical presentation, diagnostics workup, and management strategies of COVID-19 associated GBS reported in the literature. Material and method We searched Medline, PubMed Central, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar using pre-defined keywords, with no time limits and in the English language only. We aimed to include all kinds of manuscripts. The last search was done on 18th May 2020. Demographics, clinical features, diagnostic workup, management, and outcomes were documented in the datasheet. Results We identified 24 cases of COVID-19 associated GBS. Most of the cases were reported from Italy followed by the USA. The majority were males (18 \/24) The age ranged from 23 -84 years. The clinical presentation was typical sensory-motor GBS in most. Nine patients had facial palsy of which five had bilateral involvement. Two patients had bilateral abducent nerve palsy while two presented as paraparetic GBS variant with autonomic dysfunction. Electrodiagnostics was performed in 17 patients only and 12 had typical features of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Intravenous immunoglobulins were the preferred mode of treatment in most of the patient. There was one death, and most were discharged to rehabilitation or home. Conclusion GBS is a frequent neurological complication associated with COVID-19. There is no clear causative relationship between GBS, and COVID-19 at present, and more data are needed to establish the casualty. However, most cases have a post-infectious onset with male preponderance. Most of the cases have a typical presentation but some may present in an atypical way. Prognosis is generally good.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Imran Ahmad","author_inst":"Bahria University Medical and Dental College"},{"author_name":"Farooq Azam Rathore","author_inst":"Bahria University Medical and Dental College"},{"author_name":"Anfan Chen","author_inst":"School of Humanity and Social Science, University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yulong Tang","author_inst":"Institute of Communication Studies, Communication University of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130310","rel_title":"COVID-19: a crash test for biomedical publishing?","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130310","rel_abs":"The effect of COVID-19 on biomedical publishing (BP) (i.e. scientific biomedical periodicals continuously published by research communities or commercial publishers) has not been deeply explored.

PMIAC have been classified according to publication date, country, and journals for evaluation of time-, region- and scientometric-dependant impact of COVID-19 on BP and have been curated manually (i.e. each entry has been individually analyzed). PMIAC analysis reflects geographic and temporal parameters of outbreak spread. A major BP problem is related to the fact that only 40% of articles report\/review\/analyze data. Another BP weakness is the clusterization of \"highly-trusted\" publications according to countries of origin and \"highly impacting\" journals. Finally, a problem highlighted by COVID-19 crisis is the increased specification of biomedical research. To solve the problem, analytical reviews integrating data from different areas of biology and medicine are required. The data on PMIAC suggest priority of \"what is published\" over \"where it is published\" and \"who are the authors\".

Methods We included the following four groups of individuals who received both COVID-19 IgM\/IgG tests and RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from February 29, 2020 to April 29, 2020: 1470 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Leishenshan Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and Wuhan No. 7 Hospital, 3832 healthcare providers without COVID-19 diagnosis, 19555 general workers, and 1616 other patients to be admitted to the hospital (N=26473). COVID-19 patients who received IgM\/IgG tests <21 days after symptom onset were excluded. Results IgG prevalence was 89.8% (95% CI 88.2-91.3%) in COVID-19 patients, 4.0% (95% CI 3.4-4.7%) in healthcare providers, 4.6 (95% CI 4.3-4.9 %) in general workers, and 1.0% in other patients (p all <0.001 for comparisons with COVID-19 patients).

Prevalence of IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 31.4% in COVID-19 patients, 1.5% in healthcare providers, 1.3% in general workers, and 0.2% in other patients. Conclusions Very few healthcare providers had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, though a significant proportion of them had been infected with the virus.

Moreover, it is difficult to compare among the various devices regarding their sensitivity & specificity. In order to compare the performance of such devices, we used Cohen's kappa statistics to assess the level of agreement between RT-PCR and rapid antibody tests. In doing this study, we considered the term of validity after symptom-onset to compare two tests. It takes more than a week to produce antibodies in the body, and RT-PCR thus gives negative result in the convalescent period. On ELISA data from the literature kappa statistics was calculated as 1.0 beyond 10 days after symptom-onset. By taking these factors into consideration, we evaluated agreement with samples collected beyond 10 days of symptom-onset during the active period. We calculated the data from 9 devices, and the kappa statistics for English data were calculated as 0.64 on average. The same finding was 0.75 for Chinese data. These results corresponded with the values from sensitivity & specificity of their reports. Both reports had no details about the collection procedures. Kappa statistics might become even more accurate, if samples could be restricted to ones collected beyond 10 days. Regarding the data from our hospital', the kappa statistics was 0.97 when restricted to samples collected beyond 10 days, which thus showed excellent agreement.

A positive safety culture is associated with improved patient safety and in turn patient outcomes. To date, no study has evaluated the impact of Covid-19 on safety culture. Methods The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was used to investigate safety culture during Covid-19 at a large UK teaching hospital. Findings were compared with baseline data from 2017. Incident reporting from the year preceding the pandemic was also examined. Results Significant increases were seen in SAQ score for doctors and AHPs (p value) from baseline (p value). A decrease in SAQ was found in the nursing group. Largely due to perception of management and safety climate subscales. During Covid-19, on univariate regression analysis, female gender (p<0.001), age 40-49 years (p<0.01), non-white ethnicity (p<0.001), nursing job role (p<0.001) were all associated with lower SAQ scores. Training (p<0.001) and support (p<0.001) for redeployment were associated with higher SAQ scores. On multivariate analysis, non-disclosed gender (-0.13, -0.26-0.00), non-disclosed ethnicity (-0.11, -0.22-0.00), nursing role (-0.15, -0.24-0.06), and support (0.24, 0.07-0.4) persisted to significance. A significant decrease (p<0.003) was seen in error reporting after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Discussion Differences in reported safety culture may reflect perception of risk due to: occupational exposure, job function, or access to support services. Reductions in incident reporting may be due to increased workload, change in nature of work, or changing safety attitudes. Targeted high-quality support for redeployed staff may help improve safety during future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Max Denning","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ee Teng Goh","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alasdair Scott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guy Martin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Melanie Almonte","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter-Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130815","rel_title":"Assessing the burden of COVID-19 in Canada","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130815","rel_abs":"Background: The burden of COVID-19 in Canada is unequally distributed geographically, with the largest number of cases and fatalities recorded in Quebec and Ontario while other provinces experienced limited outbreaks. To date, however, no study has assessed how provincial epidemics have unfolded in a comparative perspective. This is essential to calibrate projections of the future course of the epidemic and plan health care resources for the second wave of infections. Methods: Using newly released individual-level data collected by the Public Health Agency of Canada, we assess COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality across age and gender groups at the provincial level through a combination of demographic and survival analyses. Results: Quebec has the highest absolute and per capita number of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases, hospitalizations and fatalities in all age groups. In each province, a higher number of women than men test positive for the disease, especially above age 80. Yet consistently across age groups, infected men are more likely to be hospitalized and enter intensive care than women do. These gender differences in hospitalisation rates account for the higher case fatality risk due to COVID-19 among men compared to women. Interpretation: Although health care capacity across provinces has been sufficient to treat severe cases, we find that the main factor accounting for gender differences in COVID-19-related mortality is the need for hospitalization and intensive care, especially above age 80. This suggests a selection effect of severe cases requiring to be treated in a hospital setting that needs to be further investigated.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simona Bignami","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Ari Van Assche","author_inst":"HEC Montreal"},{"author_name":"Alasdair Scott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guy Martin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Melanie Almonte","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter-Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130740","rel_title":"Air Quality and COVID-19 Prevalence\/Fatality","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130740","rel_abs":"To investigate the association of real-time\/observed ozone\/PM2.5 levels with COVID-19 prevalence\/fatality, meta-regression of data from the Northeast megalopolis was conducted.

Methods Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital from February 13 to March 14 was retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values at baseline, comorbidities, treatments and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between patients with and without critical-ill events. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to explore the risk factors for critical-ill events. A risk nomogram was established to predict the probability for the critical-ill events. Survival analysis of patients with critical-ill events was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results 463 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, of whom 397 were non-critically ill and 66 were critically ill (all from the intensive care unit). The LASSO regression identified four variables (hypersensitive cardiac troponin I, blood urea nitrogen , haemoglobin, and interleukin-6) contributing to the critical-ill events. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical-ill events associated with hypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04 ng\/mL (OR 20.98,95% CI 3.51-125.31), blood urea nitrogen greater than 7.6 mmol\/L (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.52-17.81, decreased haemoglobin (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.10), and higher interleukin-6 (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08) on admission.

Whether COVID-19 affects human thyroid function remains unknown. Methods: 84 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Hangzhou, China) were respectively enrolled in this study. In addition, 73 other patients with pneumonia and 819 healthy subjects were included as controls. Results: We found that the levels of TT3 and TSH were lower in COVID-19 patients than control groups (p<0.001). Within the group of COVID-19 patients, 61.9% patients (52\/84) presented with thyroid function abnormalities. We found a larger proportion of patients in severe condition exhibited thyroid dysfunction than mild\/moderate cases (90.4% vs. 50.0%, p < 0.001). Patients with thyroid dysfunction tended to have increased interval time for negative conversion of viral nucleic acid (14.1 {+\/-} 9.4 vs. 10.6 {+\/-} 8.3 days, p = 0.088). To note, thyroid dysfunction was also associated with decreased lymphocytes (p < 0.001) and increased CRP (p = 0.002). In 7 patients with dynamic changes of thyroid function, we observed the levels of TT3 and TSH gradually increased and reached normal range without thyroid hormone replacement at Day 30 post-admission. The correlation between TT3 and TSH level seemed to be positive rather than negative in the early stage, and gradually turned to be negatively related over time. Conclusions: Thyroid function abnormalities are common in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases. This might be caused by virus attack and damage to the thyroid-pituitary axis. Therefore, more attention should be paid to thyroid function during treatment of COVID-19, and close follow-up is also needed after discharge.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weibin Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xingyun Su","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Ding","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Weina Fan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Zhendong Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Kaijin Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Qin Ni","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Lisong Teng","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"endocrinology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130625","rel_title":"Modeling the dynamics of COVID19 spread during and after social distancing","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130625","rel_abs":"Non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, have so far been the only means to slow the spread of COVID19. In the United States, strict social distancing has resulted in different types infection dynamics. In some states, such as New York, extensive infection spread was followed by a pronounced decline of infection levels. In other states, such as California, less infection spread occurred before strict social distancing, and a different pattern was observed. Instead of a pronounced infection decline, a long-lasting plateau is evident, characterized by similar daily new infection levels. While these plateau dynamics cannot be readily reproduced with standard SIR infection models, we show that network models, in which individuals and their social contacts are explicitly tracked, can reproduce the plateau if network connections are cut due to social distancing measures. The reason is that in networks characterized by a 2D spatial structure, infection tends to spread quadratically with time, but as edges are randomly removed, the infection spreads along nearly one-dimensional infection \"corridors\", resulting in plateau dynamics. Interestingly, the plateau dynamics are predicted to eventually transition into an infection decline phase without any further increase in social distancing measures. Additionally, the models suggest that a potential second wave becomes significantly less pronounced if social distancing is only relaxed once the dynamics have transitioned to the decline phase. The network models analyzed here allow us to interpret and reconcile different infection dynamics during social distancing observed in various US states.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalia L.

Similarly to the actual spread of the disease, the dynamics of the contention patterns emerging from the application of NPIs are complex and depend on interactions between people within a specific region as well as other stochastic factors associated to demographic, geographic, political and economical conditions. Agent-based models simulate microscopic rules of simultaneous spatial interactions between multiple agents within a population, in an attempt to reproduce the complex dynamics of the effect of the contention measures. In this way, it is possible to design individual behaviours along with NPI scenarios, measuring how the simulation dynamics is affected and therefore, yielding rapid insights to perform a broad assessment of the potential of composite interventions at different stages of the epidemic. In this paper we describe a model and a tool to experiment with such kind of analysis applied to a conceptual city, considering a number of widely-applied NPIs such as social distancing, case isolation, home quarantine, total lockdown, sentinel testing, mask wearing and a distinctive \"zonal\" enforcement measure, requiring these interventions to be applied gradually to separated enclosed districts (zones). We find that the model is able to capture emerging dynamics associated to these NPIs; besides, the zonal contention strategy yields an improvement on the mitigation impact across all scenarios of combination with individual NPIs. The model and tool are open to extensions to account for omitted or newer factors affecting the planning and design of NPIs intended to counter the late stages or forthcoming waves of the COVID-19 crisis.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergio Rojas-Galeano","author_inst":"Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas"},{"author_name":"Lindsay Alvarez","author_inst":"Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Ding","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Weina Fan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Zhendong Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Kaijin Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Qin Ni","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Lisong Teng","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130823","rel_title":"Publish or perish: Reporting Characteristics of Peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints and registered studies on the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130823","rel_abs":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a mass of academic papers being published in a very brief span of time. Our aim was to compare the amount and reporting characteristics of COVID-19 related peer-reviewed and pre-prints publications. We also investigated the amount of ongoing trials and systematic reviews. Methods and findings A cross-sectional study of publications covering the COVID-19 pandemic time frame, up to May 20, 2020 was conducted. PubMed with appropriate combinations of Medical Subject Headings and COVID-19 section of MedRxiv and BioRxiv archives were searched. We examined Clinicaltrial.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, EU Register and 15 other trial registers as well as the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). Characteristics of each publication source were extracted. Regression analyses and Z tests were used to analyze publication trends over the weeks and compare their relative proportions. We found 3635 peer-reviewed publications and 3805 pre-prints, of which 8.6% (n=329) were published in indexed journals. Peer-reviewed and pre-print publications amount both increased significantly over time (p<0.001). Case reports (peer-reviewed: 6% vs pre-prints: 0.9%, p<0.001) and letters (17.4% vs 0.5%, p<0.001) accounted for a greater share of the peer-reviewed compared to pre-print publications. In turn, randomized controlled trials (0.22% vs 0.63% p<0.001) and systematic reviews (0.08% vs 5%) accounted for a significantly greater share of the pre-print publications. Clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and EU register included 57.9%, 49.5 % and 98.9% trials mostly still 'recruiting'. PROSPERO amounted to 962 systematic review protocols. Conclusion Pre-prints were slightly more prevalent than peer-reviewed publications, yet both are growing. To fill the void given by the absence of published primary studies, immediate opinions (i.e., letters) has virulently been published in PubMed. However, preprints has been promoted as rapid responses to give direct and promptly access at scientific findings in this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvia Gianola","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi"},{"author_name":"Tiago S Jesus","author_inst":"Global Health and Tropical Medicine (GHTM), WHO Collaborating Centre for Health Workforce Policy and Planning, Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - NOVA"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bargeri","author_inst":"Universita' Vita-Salute San Raffaele"},{"author_name":"Greta Castellini","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Zhendong Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Kaijin Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Qin Ni","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Lisong Teng","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130658","rel_title":"Global and local mobility as a barometer for COVID-19 dynamics","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130658","rel_abs":"Abstract. The spreading of infectious diseases including COVID-19 depends on human interactions. In an environment where behavioral patterns and physical contacts are constantly evolving according to new governmental regulations, measuring these interactions is a major challenge. Mobility has emerged as an indicator for human activity and, implicitly, for human interactions. Here we study the coupling between mobility and COVID-19 dynamics and show that variations in global air traffic and local driving mobility can be used to stratify different disease phases. For ten European countries, our study shows maximal correlation between driving mobility and disease dynamics with a time lag of 14.6 +\/- 5.6 days. Our findings suggests that local mobility can serve as a quantitative metric to forecast future reproduction numbers and identify the stages of the pandemic when mobility and reproduction become decorrelated.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Alain Goriely","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Greta Castellini","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Zhendong Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Kaijin Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Qin Ni","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Lisong Teng","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130575","rel_title":"Seroprevalence against COVID-19 and follow-up of suspected cases in primary health care in Spain","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130575","rel_abs":"Background During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic little information has been available about patients with mild or moderate symptoms attended and followed in the primary care setting, most of whom had an unknown status for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Objectives We aim to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community sample of asymptomatic individuals and among symptomatic patients (without confirmed diagnosis) followed in a primary care setting. As a secondary objective, we estimated the proportions of symptomatic patients seeing at an emergency department (ED), hospitalized or dying, and identified the most important clinical symptoms associated with a positive infection. Methods From April 21 to April 24 2020, we selected a random sample of 600 individuals stratified by age groups, from a total population of 19,899 individuals from a community area in Barcelona (study population 1). From April 29 to May 5 2020, we also invited all the patients that had been followed by general practitioners (GPs) (study population 2). We used for both populations COVID-19 Rapid lateral flow immunoassay which qualitatively assesses the presence of patient-generated IgG and IgM in approximately 10-15 minutes. The prevalence (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of infection (past and current) was defined as the proportion of individuals with antibody seropositivity. Odds ratios (ORs) for a positive test result were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results Three hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals from the randomly selected sample accepted to participate in the study. The overall mean age was 43.7 years (SD 21.79, range 1-94) and 55% were women. Seventeen individuals were seropositive for IgM and\/or IgG, resulting an overall prevalence of 5,47% (95% CI, 3.44-8.58). Six-hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed by GPs. The overall mean age was 46.97 years (SD 20.05, range 0-92) and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were seropositive for IgM and\/or IgG. During the follow-up period, 27.13% of symptomatic patients attended the ED, 11.83% were hospitalized and about 2% died. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the OR for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who had fever (>38{degrees}C), ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusions The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals in the general population was lower than expected. Approximately 40% of the symptomatic patients followed by GPs during the peak months of the pandemic in Barcelona, were positive. Fever (>38{degrees}C), anosmia, ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with a positive test result.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Brotons","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Jordi Serrano","author_inst":"UniversalDoctor"},{"author_name":"Diana Fernandez","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Carlos Garcia-Ramos","author_inst":"UniversalDoctor"},{"author_name":"Begona Ichazo","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Jeannine Lemaire","author_inst":"UniversalDoctor"},{"author_name":"Patricia Montenegro","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Irene Moral","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Ricky Perez- Wienese","author_inst":"UniversalDoctor"},{"author_name":"Marc Pitarch","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Mireia Puig","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Vilella","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Jaume Sellares","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130682","rel_title":"Development and validation of a tool to appraise guidelines on SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategies in healthcare workers","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130682","rel_abs":"Background: Clinical guidelines on infection prevention strategies in healthcare workers (HCWs) play an important role in protecting them during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Poorly constructed guidelines that are not comprehensive and are ambiguous may compromise HCWs safety. We aimed to develop and validate a tool to appraise guidelines on infection prevention strategies in HCWs. Methods: A 3-stage, web-based, Delphi consensus-building process among a panel of diverse HCWs and healthcare managers was utilised. We validated the tool by appraising 40 international, specialty-specific and procedure-specific guidelines along with national guidelines from countries with a wide range of gross national income. Results: Overall consensus (>75%) was reached at the end of three rounds for all six domains included in the tool. The chosen domains allowed appraisal of guidelines in relation to general characteristics (domain-1), recommendations on engineering (domain-2) and administrative aspects (domain 4-6) of infection prevention, as well as personal protection equipment (PPE) use (domain-3). The appraisal tool performed well across all domains and inter-rater agreement was excellent. All included guidelines performed relatively better in domains 1-3 compared with domains 4-6 and this was more evident in guidelines originating from lower income countries. Conclusion: The guideline appraisal tool was robust and easy to use. Recommendations on engineering aspects of infection prevention, administrative measures that promote optimal PPE use and HCW wellbeing were generally lacking in assessed guidelines. This tool may enable health systems to adopt high quality HCW infection prevention guidelines during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and may also provide a framework for future guideline development.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashwin Subramaniam","author_inst":"Peninsula Health"},{"author_name":"Mallikarjuna Reddy","author_inst":"Peninsula Health, Calvary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zubarev","author_inst":"Peninsula Health"},{"author_name":"Umesh Kadam","author_inst":"Werribee Hospital, Casey Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Jie Lim","author_inst":"Ballarat Base Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Anstey","author_inst":"Griffith University University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Bihari","author_inst":"Flinders University andMedical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"Aster CMI Hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Subhathra Karunanithi","author_inst":"Valley Medical Group, New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Western Health"},{"author_name":"Neil Mara","author_inst":"NHS"},{"author_name":"Saikat Mitra","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kollengode Ramanathan","author_inst":"National University Hospital Singapore"},{"author_name":"Arvind Rajamani","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Francesca Rubulotta","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Svensk","author_inst":"Sundsvall hospital, Sundsvall, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130294","rel_title":"Impact of social distancing measures for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 : A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130294","rel_abs":"Abstract Introduction: Social distancing measures (SDMs) protect public health from the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the impact of SDMs has been inconsistent and unclear. This study aims to assess the effects of SDMs (e.g. isolation, quarantine) for reducing the transmission of COVID-19. Methods and analysis: We will conduct a systematic review meta-analysis research of both randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled trials. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied & Complementary Medicine, COVID-19 Research and WHO database on COVID-19 for primary studies assessing the enablers and barriers associated with SDMs, and will be reported in accordance with PRISMA statement. The PRISMA-P checklist will be used while preparing this protocol. We will use Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines (JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists) to assess the methodological qualities and synthesised performing thematic analysis. Two reviewers will independently screen the papers and extracted data. If sufficient data are available, the random-effects model for meta-analysis will be performed to measure the effect size of SDMs or the strengths of relationships. To assess the heterogeneity of effects, I2 together with the observed effects (Q-value, with degrees of freedom) will be used to provide the true effects in the analysis. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval and consent will not be required for this systematic review of the literature as it does not involve human participation. We will be able to disseminate the study findings using the following strategies: we will be publishing at least one paper in peer-reviewed journals, and an abstract will be presented at suitable national\/international conferences or workshops.

We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed methods design. This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves: between August 2019-March 2020 and during the first six weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.062). Adults were two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.016; 95% CI [1.14, 3.49]). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms among adults with histories of childhood trauma during the first six weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources in South Africa.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Wooyoung Kim","author_inst":"Department of Anthropology, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Tawanda Nyengerai","author_inst":"School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Emily Mendenhall","author_inst":"Edmund A.

Many ecological factors are proven to influence the transmission and survival of the virus. In this study, we aim to determine the association of different climate factors with the spread and mortality due to COVID-19. Methods: The climate indicators included in the study were duration of sunshine, average minimum temperature and average maximum temperature, with cumulative confirmed cases, deceased and recovered cases. The data was performed for 138 different countries of the world, between January 2020 to May 2020. Both univariate and multivariate was performed for cumulative and month-wise analysis using SPSS software. Results: The average maximum temperature, and sunshine duration was significantly associated with COVID-19 confirmed cases, deceased and recovered. For every one degree increase in mean average temperature, the confirmed, deceased and recovered cases decreased by 2047(p=0.03), 157(p=0.016), 743 (p=0.005) individuals. The association remained significant even after adjusting for environmental such as sunshine duration as well as non-environmental variables. Average sunshine duration was inversely correlated with increase in daily new cases ({rho}= -2261) and deaths ({rho}= -0.2985). Conclusion: Higher average temperature and longer sunshine duration was strongly associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 138 countries. Hence the temperature is an important factor in SARS CoV-2 survival and this study will help in formulating better preventive measures to combat COVID-19 based on their climatic conditions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swati Thangriyal","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Aayushi Rastogi","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Arvind Tomar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Scinces, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sukriti Baweja","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Zheng Jie Lim","author_inst":"Ballarat Base Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Anstey","author_inst":"Griffith University University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Bihari","author_inst":"Flinders University andMedical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"Aster CMI Hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Subhathra Karunanithi","author_inst":"Valley Medical Group, New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Western Health"},{"author_name":"Neil Mara","author_inst":"NHS"},{"author_name":"Saikat Mitra","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kollengode Ramanathan","author_inst":"National University Hospital Singapore"},{"author_name":"Arvind Rajamani","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Francesca Rubulotta","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Svensk","author_inst":"Sundsvall hospital, Sundsvall, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130880","rel_title":"Predictors of CPAP outcome in hospitalised COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130880","rel_abs":"Introduction: Throughout March - April 2020, many patients with COVID-19 presented to Southend University Hospital with Acute Hypoxaemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF). Patients were managed in a Specialist Respiratory High Dependency Unit. We present our experience on the usage of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and possible indicators of its success in this patient group. Methods: Data from patients (n=89) requiring mechanical ventilation during the months of March to April 2020, were retrospectively collected and analysed. 37 patients received IMV (Invasive Mechanical Ventilation) without a CPAP trial beforehand. 52 patients underwent a CPAP trial, of which 21 patients successfully avoided intubation and ITU admission. Results: The 52 patients, prior to receiving CPAP had significant respiratory failure as evidenced by a low PaO2: FiO2 (PFR) (mean +\/- SD 123 +\/- 60 mmHg) and mean SpO2:FiO2 (SFR) (mean +\/- SD: 140+\/- 50). The main indicators of CPAP success were: higher SFR before and after CPAP, lower respiratory rate (RR) , lower Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and higher PFR prior to CPAP. Discussion: CPAP proved successful in 40% of COVID-19 patients presenting with AHRF. SFR, PFR, RR and NLR are predictors of such success. SFR can be used for effective real time monitoring of patients before and after CPAP to identify likelihood of success. Based on our results, we have suggested a modified CPAP management protocol in COVID-19. These findings can guide future studies and will allow improved triage of patients to either CPAP or IMV, in the event of a future COVID peak.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yasser Noeman Ahmed","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sriya Gokaraju","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Powrie","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dora Amran","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman El Sayed","author_inst":"Alexandria University Faculty of Medicine, Biomedical Informatics and Medical Statistics Department, Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ashraf Roshdy","author_inst":"Whipps Cross University Hospital, Critical Care Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Bihari","author_inst":"Flinders University andMedical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"Aster CMI Hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Subhathra Karunanithi","author_inst":"Valley Medical Group, New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Western Health"},{"author_name":"Neil Mara","author_inst":"NHS"},{"author_name":"Saikat Mitra","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kollengode Ramanathan","author_inst":"National University Hospital Singapore"},{"author_name":"Arvind Rajamani","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Francesca Rubulotta","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Svensk","author_inst":"Sundsvall hospital, Sundsvall, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"}]}
