As of 24 May 2020, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections reached 4469, with 160 deaths and 2738 patients were recovered from the infection. Significant public health strategies have been implemented by the authorities to contain the outbreak nationwide. Nevertheless however, the number of cases is still rising dramatically. Here, we aim to describe a comprehensive and epidemiological study of all cases diagnosed in Iraq by 24 May 2020. Most of the cases were recorded in Baghdad followed by Basra and Najaf. About 45% of the patients were female (with 31% deaths of the total cases) and 55% were male (with 68% deaths of the total cases). Most cases are between the ages of (20-59) years old, and (30-39) years are the most affected range (19%) Approximately (8%) of cases are children under 10 years old. Iraq has shown a cure rate lower than those reported by Iran, Turkey and Jordan; and higher than Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Healthcare workers represented about (5%) of the total confirmed cases. These findings enable us to understand COVID-19 epidemiology and prevalence in Iraq that can alert the our community to the risk of this novel coronavirus and serve as a baseline for future studies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adil R.

Specifically, the contagion and removal terms, normally linear in the fraction $I$ of infecteds, are taken to depend on $I^{\\,q_{up}}$ and $I^{\\,q_{down}}$, respectively. These dependencies can be understood as highly reduced effective descriptions of contagion via anomalous diffusion of susceptibles and infecteds in fractal geometries, and removal (i.e., recovery or death) via complex mechanisms leading to slowly decaying removal-time distributions. We obtain rather convincing fits to time series for both active cases and mortality with the same values of $(q_{up},q_{down})$ for a given country, suggesting that such aspects may in fact be present in the early evolution of the Covid-19 pandemics. We also obtain approximate values for the effective population $N_{\\mathit{eff}}$, which turns out to be a small percentage of the entire population $N$ for each country.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ugur TIRNAKLI","author_inst":"Ege University"},{"author_name":"Constantino Tsallis","author_inst":"CBPF"},{"author_name":"Thaer A.

Methods: A locally developed rapid IgM\/IgG test kit was used for screening hospital staff and patients who required procedural treatment or surgery in 52 hospitals in Thailand from April 8 to June 26, 2020. A total of 857 participants were tested--675 were hospital staff and 182 were pre-procedural patients. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002) Results Overall, 5.5% of the participants (47 of 857) had positive immunoglobulin M (IgM), 0.2% (2 of 857) had positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM. Hospitals located in the Central part of Thailand had the highest IgM seroprevalence (11.9%). Preprocedural patients had a higher rate of positive IgM than the hospital staff (12.1% vs. 3.7%). Participants with present upper respiratory tract symptoms had a higher rate of positive IgM than those without (9.6% vs. 4.5%). Three quarters (80.5%, 690 of 857) of the participants were asymptomatic, of which, 31 had positive IgM (4.5%) which consisted of 20 of 566 healthcare workers (3.5%) and 11 of 124 preprocedural patients (8.9%).

Healthcare workers are one of the risk groups that need to be well characterized due to their strategic role in the management of patients, presently and in prevention of healthcare needs for future outbreaks. This study presents the results of the first SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain. Methods: IgG SARS-CoV2 antibodies were analyzed in serum samples from 7563 healthcare workers of the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona taken during the pandemia (from May 4th to May 22nd, 2020) by chemiluminescence assays. Results: A total of 779 of 7563 (10.3%) healthcare workers had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (specific for either S1\/S2 or N antigens). No significant differences were observed between those working at primary care or at the reference hospital. Interestingly, in 29 (8.53%) of the previously confirmed positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) patients SARS-CoV-2 IgG (S1\/S2 or recombinant N antigen) were negative. Conclusion: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the healthcare workers of the Nord Metropolitan Area of Barcelona was significantly increased in comparison with the general population in the same geographical area. These results give us an important insight for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, in a collective that is essential for the response against this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gema Fern\u00e1ndez-Rivas","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias.

Treatment targeting this immune response might be beneficial but there is limited evidence on its efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine if early treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with tocilizumab and\/or steroids was associated with better outcome. Methods This observational single-center study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were not intubated and received either standard of care (SOC, controls) or SOC plus early (within 3 days from hospital admission) anti-inflammatory treatment. SOC consisted of hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid plus, in those admitted before March 24th, also darunavir\/ritonavir. Anti-inflammatory treatment consisted of either tocilizumab (8mg\/kg intravenously or 162mg subcutaneously) or methylprednisolone 1 mg\/kg for 5 days or both. Failure was defined as intubation or death, and the endpoints were failure-free survival (primary endpoint) and overall survival (secondary) at day 30. Difference between the groups was estimated as Hazard Ratio by a propensity score weighted Cox regression analysis (HROW). Results Overall, 196 adults were included in the analyses. They were mainly male (67.4%), with comorbidities (78.1%) and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (83.7%). Median age was 67.9 years (range, 30-100) and median PaO2\/FiO2 200 mmHg (IQR 133-289). Among them, 130 received early anti-inflammatory treatment with: tocilizumab (n=29, 22.3%), methylprednisolone (n=45, 34.6%), or both (n=56, 43.1%). The adjusted failure-free survival among tocilizumab\/methylprednisolone\/SOC treated patients vs. SOC was 80.8% (95%CI, 72.8-86.7) vs. 64.1% (95%CI, 51.3-74.0), HROW 0.48, 95%CI, 0.23-0.99; p=0.049. The overall survival among tocilizumab\/methylprednisolone\/SOC patients vs. SOC was 85.9% (95%CI, 80.7-92.6) vs. 71.9% (95%CI, 46-73), HROW 0.41, 95%CI: 0.19-0.89, p=0.025. Conclusion Early adjunctive treatment with tocilizumab, methylprednisolone or both may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malgorzata Mikulska","author_inst":"University of Genova"},{"author_name":"Laura Ambra Nicolini","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessio Signori","author_inst":"Section of Biostatistics, Department of Health Sciences, University of Genova, Genova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Di Biagio","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

We conducted a retrospective descriptive study from Feb 2020 to May 2020 on COVID-19 patients with ARDS and hyperinflammation characterized by raised CRP and\/or ferritin. A total of 244 patients with COVID-19 were admitted out of which 107 had ARDS. Thirty patients had both ARDS and hyperinflammation and received tocilizumab. The mean age was 62.5 years (SD: 13.5) and the majority were male (83%). The mean CRP pre-treatment was 217.5 mg\/L and post 48 to 72 hours of tocilizumab treatment was 98.5 mg\/L. Twenty-one patients (70%) also received concomitant intravenous methylprednisolone. Of the 30 patients, 7 died and 20 recovered. Ten patients required intensive care unit admission and nine developed nosocomial infections. COVID-19 associated aspergillosis was diagnosed in three patients post tocilizumab treatment.

A thorough understanding of the molecular and histological correlates of the disease is still missing, especially because post-mortem analysis of COVID-19-affected organs has been so far scant and often anecdotical. Here we report the results of the systematic analysis of 41 consecutive post-mortem samples from individuals who died of COVID-19. We found that the disease is characterized by extensive alveolar damage and thrombosis of the lung micro- and macro-vasculature. Thrombi were in different stages of organization, consistent with an ongoing, endogenous thrombotic process. In all the analyzed samples, in situ RNA hybridization showed that pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells had massive presence of viral RNA even at the later stages of the disease. An additional feature of the disease was the presence, in the vast majority of patients, of a large number of dysmorphic pneumocytes, often forming large syncytial elements, a consequence of the fusogenic activity of the viral Spike protein, detected with specific antibodies. Despite occasional presence of virus-positive cells in the heart, no overt signs of viral infection were detected in other organs, which showed common alterations compatible with prolonged hypoxia, multifocal organ disease or previous comorbidities. In summary, COVID-19 is a unique interstitial pneumonia with extensive lung thrombosis, long-term persistence of viral replication in pneumocytes and endothelial cells, along with the presence of infected cellular syncytia in the lung.

Brazil is the second country with more deaths due to COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate excess cardiovascular mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in 6 Brazilian capital cities. Methods: Using the Civil Registry public database, we evaluated total and cardiovascular excess deaths, further stratified in ACS, stroke and unspecified cardiovascular deaths in the 6 Brazilian cities with greater number of COVID-19 deaths (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, Recife, Belem, Manaus). We compared data from epidemiological weeks 12 to 22 of 2020, with the same period in 2019. We also compared the number of hospital and home deaths during the period. Results: There were 69,328 deaths and 17,877 COVID-19 deaths in the studied period and cities for 2020. Cardiovascular mortality increased in most cities, with greater magnitude in the Northern capitals. However, while there was a reduction in ACS and stroke in the most developed cities, the Northern capitals showed an increase of these events. For unspecified cardiovascular deaths, there was a marked increase in all cities, which strongly correlated to the rise in home deaths (r=0.86, p=0.01). Conclusion: The excess cardiovascular mortality was greater in the less developed cities, possibly associated with healthcare collapse. ACS and stroke deaths decreased in the most developed cities, in parallel with an increase in unspecified cardiovascular and home deaths, presumably as a result of misdiagnosis. Conversely, ACS and stroke deaths increased in cities with a healthcare collapse.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luisa Campos Caldeira Brant","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Bruno Ramos Nascimento","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Renato Teixeira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Antonio Queiroga Lopes","author_inst":"Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia"},{"author_name":"Deborah Carvalho Malta","author_inst":"Escola de Enfermagem da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Glaucia Maria Moraes Oliveira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Antonio Luiz Pinho Ribeiro","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Secco","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maria Concetta Volpe","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Andrea Colliva","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

To investigate the benefits and costs of contact tracing, we develop an individual-based contact-network model and a susceptible-exposed-infected-confirmed (SEIC) epidemic model for the stochastic simulations of COVID-19 transmission. We estimate the unknown parameters (reproductive ratio R0 and confirmed rate {delta}2) by using observed confirmed case data. After a two month-lockdown, states in the USA have started the reopening process. We provide simulations for four different reopening situations: under \"stay-at-home\" order or no reopening, 25% reopening, 50% reopening, and 75% reopening. We model contact tracing in a two-layer network by modifying the basic SEIC epidemic model. The two-layer network is composed by the contact network in the first layer and the tracing network in the second layer. Since the full contact list of an infected individual patient can be hard to obtain, then we consider different fractions of contacts from 60% to 5%. The goal of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of contact tracing to control the COVID-19 spreading in the reopening process. In terms of benefits, simulation results show that increasing the fraction of traced contacts decreases the size of the epidemic. For example, tracing 20% of the contacts is enough for all four reopening scenarios to reduce the epidemic size by half. Considering the act of quarantining susceptible households as the contact tracing cost, we have observed an interesting phenomenon. When we increase the fraction of traced contacts from 5% to 20%, the number of quarantined susceptible people increases because each individual confirmed case is mentioning more contacts. However, when we increase the fraction of traced contacts from 20% to 60%, the number of quarantined susceptible people decreases because the increment of the mentioned contacts is balanced by a reduced number of confirmed cases. The main contribution of this research lies in the investigation of the effectiveness of contact tracing for the containment of COVID-19 spreading during the initial phase of the reopening process of the USA.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sifat afroj Moon","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Caterina Scoglio","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Renato Teixeira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Antonio Queiroga Lopes","author_inst":"Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia"},{"author_name":"Deborah Carvalho Malta","author_inst":"Escola de Enfermagem da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Glaucia Maria Moraes Oliveira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Antonio Luiz Pinho Ribeiro","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Secco","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maria Concetta Volpe","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Andrea Colliva","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

Understanding the epidemiology of viral outbreaks is the first step towards vaccine development programs. This is the first phylodynamics study attempted on of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India to infer its current evolution in the context of an ongoing pandemic. Out of 286 retrieved SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes from India, 138 haplotypes were generated and analyzed. Median-joining network was built to investigate the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes in India. The BDSIR package of BEAST2 was used to calculate the reproduction number (R0) and the infectious rate of the virus. Past and current population trend was investigated using the stamp date method in coalescent Bayesian skyline plot, implemented in BEAST2 and by exponential growth prior in BEAST 1.10.4. Median-joining network reveals two distinct ancestral clusters A and B showing genetic affinities with Wuhan outbreak sample. The network also illustrates the autochthonous development of isolates in a few instances. High basic reproduction number of SARS-nCoV-2 in India points towards the phase of active community transmission. The Bayesian skyline plot revel exponential rise in the effective population size (Ne) of Indian isolates from the first week of January to the first week of April 2020. More genome sequencing and analyses of the virus will be required in coming days to monitor COVID19 after the upliftment of lock down in India.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sameera Farah","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Laboratory of Molecular and Conservation Genetics, Govt.

The elderly also suffer from increased morbidity and mortality from seasonal influenza infection, and thus annual influenza vaccination is recommended for them. In this study, we explore a possible area-level association between influenza vaccination coverage in people aged 65 years and older and the number of deaths from COVID-19. To this end, we used COVID-19 data until June 10, 2020 together with population health data for the United States at the county level. We fit quasi-Poisson regression models using influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population as the independent variable and the number of deaths from COVID-19 as the outcome variable. We adjusted for a wide array of potential confounding variables using both county-level generalized propensity scores for influenza vaccination rates, as well as direct adjustment. Our results suggest that influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population is negatively associated with mortality from COVID-19. This finding is robust to using different analysis periods, different thresholds for inclusion of counties, and a variety of methodologies for confounding adjustment. In conclusion, our results suggest a potential protective effect of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 mortality in the elderly population. The significant public health implications of this possibility point to an urgent need for studying the relationship between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 mortality at the individual level, to investigate both the epidemiology and any underlying biological mechanism.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio Zanettini","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Omar","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Wikum Dinalankara","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Eddie Luidy Imada","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Colantuoni","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Parmigiani","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Luigi Marchionni","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Secco","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maria Concetta Volpe","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Andrea Colliva","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

Background: There have been growing concerns about the speed and rigor of the review process for COVID-related articles by journals. Methods: Using Dimensions, an online searchable platform, we identified PubMed-indexed journals that published >50 COVID-related articles (regardless of article type) between 1\/1\/2020 and 5\/16\/2020 and had available data on the date of article receipt. For the control group, we included consecutive full-length original investigations with available receipt date (regardless of topic) published in these journals starting from 3\/1\/2019 until a 1:2 ratio of COVID to non-COVID-related articles per journal was achieved. Results: The final number included 294 COVID-related full-length original investigations with available article receipt dates published in 16 journals with corresponding 588 control articles from the same journals. The median time from article receipt to online publication was 20 (11-32) days for COVID-articles vs. 119 (62-182) days for controls (P<0.001). The median time to final acceptance (available for 97% of the articles) was 13 (5-23) days for COVID vs. 102 (55-161) days for controls (P<0.001). These observations were seen across all the included journals in the analysis. Conclusions: In this analysis of full-length original investigations published in 16 medical journals, the median time from receipt to final acceptance of COVID-related articles was 8 times faster compared to non-COVID-related articles published in a similar time frame in the previous year. Online publication was 6 times faster for COVID-related articles compared to controls.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amr F Barakat","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Shokr","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Ibrahim","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Mandrola","author_inst":"Baptist Health Louisville"},{"author_name":"Islam Y Elgendy","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Meirion Rhys Evans","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Paul Longley","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Janusz Janiec","author_inst":"Narodowy Instytut Zdrowia Publicznego"},{"author_name":"Roiyah Saltus","author_inst":"University of South Wales"},{"author_name":"Giri Shankar","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

This has important implications for the risk of patient-to-staff, staff-to-staff and staff-to patient transmission among health professionals in maternity. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of previously undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health professionals from two tertiary-level maternity units in London, UK and to determine associations between HCW characteristics, reported symptoms and serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 200 anaesthetists, midwives and obstetricians with no previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were tested for immune seroconversion using laboratory IgG assays. Comprehensive symptom and medical histories were also collected. 5\/40 (12.5%; 95% CI: 4.2-26.8) anaesthetists, 7\/52 (13.5%; 95% CI: 5.6-25.8%) obstetricians and 17\/108 (15.7%; 95% CI: 9.5-24.0%) midwives were seropositive, with an overall total of 29\/200 (14.5%; 95% CI: 9.9-20.1%) of maternity healthcare workers testing positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Of those who had seroconverted, 10\/29 (35.5%) were completely asymptomatic. Fever or cough were only present in 6\/29 (20.7%) and (10\/29 (34.5%) respectively. Anosmia was the most common symptom occurring in 15\/29 (51.7%) seropositive participants and was the only symptom that was predictive of positive seroconversion (OR 18; 95% CI 6 to 55). 58.6% of those who were seropositive had not self-isolated at any point and continued to provide patient care in the hospital setting. This study was the largest study of baseline immune seroconversion in maternity healthcare workers conducted to date and reveals that 1 in 6 were seropositive, of whom 1 in 3 were asymptomatic. This has significant implications for the risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for both staff and patients in maternity and regular testing of staff, including asymptomatic staff should be considered to reduce transmission risk.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sohail Bampoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Dominique Nuala Lucas","author_inst":"Northwick Park Hospital"},{"author_name":"Georgina Neall","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Penny Sceales","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Reena Aggarwal","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Siassakos","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Mark Odor","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Janusz Janiec","author_inst":"Narodowy Instytut Zdrowia Publicznego"},{"author_name":"Roiyah Saltus","author_inst":"University of South Wales"},{"author_name":"Giri Shankar","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

Thus, community members, business owners, and even medical personnel have resorted to alternative methods for sterilizing face coverings and N95 respirators for reuse. While significant work has shown that vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) can be used to sterilize N95 respirators, the cost and installation time for these sterilization systems limit their accessibility. To this end, we have designed and constructed a novel, cost-effective, and scalable VHP system that can be used to sterilize N95 respirators and other face coverings for clinical and community applications. N95 respirators inoculated with P22 bacteriophage showed a greater than 6-log10 reduction in viral load when sterilized in the VHP system for one 60-minute cycle. Further, N95 respirators treated with 20 cycles in this VHP system showed comparable filtration efficiency to untreated N95 respirators in a 50 to 200 nanometer particulate challenge filtration test. While a 23% average increase in water droplet roll-off time was observed for N95 respirators treated with 5 cycles in the sterilization, no breakdown in fluid resistance was detected. These data suggest that our VHP system is effective in sterilizing N95 respirators and other polypropylene masks for reuse. Relating to the present epidemic, deployment of this system reduces the risk of COVID-19 community transmission while conserving monetary resources otherwise spent on the continuous purchase of disposable N95 respirators and other face coverings. In summary, this novel, scientifically validated sterilization system can be easily built at a low cost and implemented in a wide range of settings.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikhil Dave","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Katie Sue Pascavis","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"John M Patterson","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"David W Wallace","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abhik Chowdhury","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Morteza Abbaszadegan","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Absar Alum","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Pierre Herckes","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Zhaobo Zhang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Kozicki","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Erica Forzani","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Jimena Mora","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Josh Chang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Clinton Ewell","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Tyler Smith","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Mark Naufel","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Sara Mora","author_inst":"Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Delfino","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Toscanini","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Balletto","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

With global contagion figures exceeding 4 million persons, the shortage of reagents for RNA extraction represents a bottleneck for testing globally. We present the validation results for a RT-qPCR protocol without prior RNA extraction. Because of its simplicity, this protocol is suitable for widespread application in resource-limited settings. Methods: Optimal protocol was selected by comparing RT-qPCR performance under a set of thermal (65{degrees}C, 70{degrees}C, and 95{degrees}C for 5, 10, and 30 minutes) and amplification conditions (3 or 3,5 uL loading volume; 2 commercial RT-qPCR kits with limit of detection below 10 copies\/sample) in nasopharyngeal swabs stored at 4{degrees}C in sterile Weise buffer pH 7.2. The selected protocol was evaluated for classification concordance with the standard protocol (automated RNA extraction) in 130 routine samples and in 50 historical samples with Cq values near to the clinical decision limit. Results: Optimal selected conditions were: Thermal shock at 70{degrees}C for 10 minutes, loading 3.5 ul in the RT-qPCR. Prospective evaluation in 130 routine samples showed 100% classification concordance with the standard protocol. The evaluation in historical samples, selected because their Cqs were at the clinical decision limit, showed 94% concordance with our confirmatory-gold standard which includes manual RNA extraction. Conclusions: These results validate the use of this direct RT-qPCR protocol as a safe alternative for SARS CoV-2 diagnosis in case of a shortage of reagents for RNA extraction, with minimal clinical impact.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose P.

The most common manifestation of SARS-CoV2 infection (Coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19) is viral pneumonia with varying degrees of respiratory compromise and up to 40% of hospitalized patients might develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Several clinical trials evaluated the role of corticosteroids in non-COVID-19 ARDS with conflicting results. We designed a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of early intravenous dexamethasone administration on the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation within 28 days after randomization in adult patients with moderate or severe ARDS due to confirmed or probable COVID-19. METHODS: This is a pragmatic, prospective, randomized, stratified, multicenter, open-label, controlled trial including 350 patients with early-onset (less than 48h before randomization) moderate or severe ARDS, defined by the Berlin criteria, due to COVID-19. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to either standard treatment plus dexamethasone (intervention group) or standard treatment without dexamethasone (control group). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20mg IV once daily for 5 days, followed by dexamethasone 10mg IV once daily for additional 5 days or until Intensive Care Unit (ICU) discharge, whichever occurs first. The primary outcome is ventilator-free days within 28 days after randomization, defined as days alive and free from invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality rates at day 28, evaluation of the clinical status at day 15 assessed with a 6-level ordinal scale, mechanical ventilation duration from randomization to day 28, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score evaluation at 48h, 72h and 7 days and ICU-free days within 28. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Brazilian National Committee of Ethics in Research (Comissao Nacional de Etica em Pesquisa - CONEP) and National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). An independent data monitoring committee will perform interim analyses and evaluate adverse events throughout the trial. Results will be submitted for publication after enrolment and follow-up are complete.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bruno Martins Tomazini","author_inst":"Hospital Sirio-Libanes"},{"author_name":"Israel S.

By comparing the growth rates in daily hospitalisations or confirmed cases under different interventions, we provide evidence that the effect of school closure is visible as a reduction in the growth rate approximately 9 days after implementation. Limited school attendance, such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does not appear to significantly affect community transmission. A large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible in countries such as Denmark or Norway, where community transmission is generally low. However, school reopening can contribute to significant increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community transmission is relatively high. Our findings underscore the need for a cautious evaluation of reopening strategies that ensure low classroom occupancy and a solid infrastructure to quickly identify and isolate new infections.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Helena B Stage","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Joseph Shingleton","author_inst":"Emergency Response Department, Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sanmitra Ghosh","author_inst":"MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Francesca Scarabel","author_inst":"Laboratory of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pellis","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas Finnie","author_inst":"Emergency Response Department, Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ricardo A.

Even though it is arguably not an established diagnostic tool, using machine learning-based analysis of COVID-19 medical scans has shown the potential to provide a preliminary digital second opinion. This can help in managing the current pandemic, and thus has been attracting significant research attention. In this research, we propose a multi-task pipeline that takes advantage of the growing advances in deep neural network models. In the first stage, we fine-tuned an Inception-v3 deep model for COVID-19 recognition using multi-modal learning, i.e., using X-ray and CT scans. In addition to outperforming other deep models on the same task in the recent literature, with an attained accuracy of 99.4%, we also present comparative analysis for multi-modal learning against learning from X-ray scans alone. The second and the third stages of the proposed pipeline complement one another in dealing with different types of infection manifestations. The former features a convolutional neural network architecture for recognizing three types of manifestations, while the latter transfers learning from another knowledge domain, namely, pulmonary nodule segmentation in CT scans, to produce binary masks for segmenting the regions corresponding to these manifestations. Our proposed pipeline also features specialized streams in which multiple deep models are trained separately to segment specific types of infection manifestations, and we show the significant impact that this framework has on various performance metrics. We evaluate the proposed models on widely adopted datasets, and we demonstrate an increase of approximately 4% and 7% for dice coefficient and mean intersection-over-union (mIoU), respectively, while achieving 60% reduction in computational time, compared to the recent literature.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shimaa El-bana","author_inst":"Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Al-Kabbany","author_inst":"Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Maha Sharkas","author_inst":"Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Francesca Scarabel","author_inst":"Laboratory of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pellis","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas Finnie","author_inst":"Emergency Response Department, Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ricardo A.

GCOs have been shown to precede consolidations. Quantitative characterization of these regions using radiomics can facilitate accurate diagnosis, disease progression and response to treatment. However, according to the knowledge of the author, regional CT radiomics analysis of COVID-19 patients has not been carried out. This study aims to address these by determining the radiomics features that can characterize each of the regions separately and can distinguish the regions from each other. Methods: 44 radiomics features were generated with four quantization levels for 23 CT slice of 17 patients. Two approaches were the implemented to determine the features that can differentiate between lung regions: 1) Z-score and correlation heatmaps and 2) one way ANOVA for finding statistically significantly difference (p<0.05) between the regions. Radiomics features that show agreement for all cases (Z-score, correlation and statistical significant test) were selected as suitable features. The features were then tested on 52 CT images. Results: 10 radiomics features were found to be the most suitable among 44 features. When applied on the test images, they can differentiate between GCO, consolidation and pleural effusion successfully and the difference provided by these 10 features between three lung regions are statistically significant. Conclusion: The ten robust radiomics features can be useful in extracting quantitative data from CT lung images to characterize the disease in the patient, which in turn can help in more accurate diagnosis, staging the severity of the disease and allow the clinician to plan for more successful personalized treatment for COVID-19 patients. They can also be used for monitoring the progression of COVID-19 and response to therapy for clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahbubunnabi Tamal","author_inst":"Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Al-Kabbany","author_inst":"Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Maha Sharkas","author_inst":"Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Francesca Scarabel","author_inst":"Laboratory of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pellis","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas Finnie","author_inst":"Emergency Response Department, Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ricardo A.

New studies investigating the tenacity of SARS-CoV-2 have highlighted its ability to persist on a myriad of surfaces for several days, including gowns and shoes. As a result, there is a global need for sterilization of a variety of potentially-contaminated items, ranging from clothing to personal protective equipment like face coverings. To this end, we have designed and constructed a cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable sterilization system that uses ozone gas to inactivate viral particles. We sought to determine the efficacy of the system in the sterilization of viral particles as well as its ability to sterilize N95 respirators for reuse. N95 respirators inoculated with P22 bacteriophage and sterilized in the ozone system showed a 6-log10 reduction in viral load when treated at 25 ppm for 150 minutes. Further, N95 respirators treated with five 150-minute cycles at 35 ppm for a total concentration-time product (CT) of 26,250 ppm*min in the ozone system showed comparable filtration efficiency to untreated N95 respirators in a 50 to 200 nmr particulate challenge filtration test. Interestingly, the surgical N95 respirators tested showed complete inactivation of fluid resistance and degradation of the elasticity of polyisoprene straps after five cycles in the sterilization system. Taken together, these data suggest that while our ozone system may negatively affect certain protective aspects of surgical N95 respirators, it does effectively sterilize viral particles and can be utilized for a multitude of other use cases, including sterilizing polypropylene face coverings after potential SARS-CoV-2 contamination. In addition to providing long-term environmental benefits, deployment of this system during the ongoing pandemic reduces the risk of COVID-19 community transmission while conserving monetary resources otherwise spent on the continuous purchase of disposable face coverings.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikhil Dave","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Katie Sue Pascavis","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"John M Patterson","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Kozicki","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"David W Wallace","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abhik Chowdhury","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Morteza Abbaszadegan","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Absar Alum","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Pierre Herckes","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Zhaobo Zhang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Josh Chang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Clinton Ewell","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Tyler Smith","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Mark Naufel","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Lucas P.

Although there are many debates about whether states reopened their economies too early, no study has examined this effect quantitatively. This paper takes advantage of the daily cases, deaths, and test data at the state level, and uses the synthetic control method to address this question. I find that reopening the economy caused an additional 2000 deaths in the 6 states (Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas) that reopened before May 1st by three weeks after reopening. It also increased daily confirmed cases by 40%, 52%, and 53% after the first, second, and third week of reopening, respectively. Moreover, contrary to scientists' prescription that expanding tests is a necessary condition for reopening, these states witnessed a decline in daily tests by 17%, 47%, and 31% after the first, second, and third week of reopening, respectively.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiyao Zhou","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Katie Sue Pascavis","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"John M Patterson","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Kozicki","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"David W Wallace","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abhik Chowdhury","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Morteza Abbaszadegan","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Absar Alum","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Pierre Herckes","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Zhaobo Zhang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Josh Chang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Clinton Ewell","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Tyler Smith","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Mark Naufel","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Lucas P.

We aimed to describe the clinical course and final outcomes of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the full spectrum of disease severity. We also aimed to identify potential predictive factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. One-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, and 58.5% were male. More than half (56%) of the patients were mild disease severity, 22% were moderate, 14% were severe, and 3% were critical. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5%. The final clinical outcomes in 189 (97.9%) were recovered and 4 (2.1%) were deceased. The incidence of pneumonia was 39%. Bilateral was more prevalent than unilateral pneumonia (65% vs. 35%). In multivariable logistic regression, increasing age (OR 2.55 per 10-year increase from 30 years old; 95% CI, 1.67-3.90; p<0.001), obesity (OR 8.74; 95%CI, 2.06-37.18; p=0.003), and higher temperature at presentation (OR 4.59 per 1 degree Celsius increase from 37.2 degree Celsius; 95% CI, 2.30-9.17; p<0.001) were potential predictive factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion Across the spectrum of disease severities, most patients with COVID-19 in our cohort had good final clinical outcomes. COVID-19 pneumonia was found in one-third of them. Older age, obesity, and higher fever at presentation were independent predictors of COVID-19 pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wannarat A Pongpirul","author_inst":"Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute"},{"author_name":"Surasak Wiboonchutikul","author_inst":"Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute"},{"author_name":"Lantharita Charoenpong","author_inst":"Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute"},{"author_name":"Nayot Panitantum","author_inst":"Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute"},{"author_name":"Apichart Vachiraphan","author_inst":"Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute"},{"author_name":"Sumonmal Uttayamakul","author_inst":"Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute"},{"author_name":"Krit Pongpirul","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Weerawat Manosuthi","author_inst":"Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute"},{"author_name":"Wisit Prasithsirikul","author_inst":"Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute"},{"author_name":"Zhaobo Zhang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Josh Chang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Clinton Ewell","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Tyler Smith","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Mark Naufel","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Lucas P.

Methods The study employed a longitudinal design. Participants were recruited for an online panel survey from chat groups on social media platforms. There were 5 waves of interviews. Information on uncertainty stress and related variables were collected via the online survey. Descriptive statistics and the GIM program were used for data analysis. Results Participants numbered 150 for the linkable baseline survey and 102 (68%) for the final survey. Uncertainty stress({beta}: -0.047, S.E: 0.118, p>0.05) did not show a statistically significant temporal change trend over the observation period. Disease fear manifested a statistically significant downwards trend ({beta}: -0.342, S.E: 0.157, p<0.05), and prevention behaviors indicated an upwards trend ({beta}: 0.048, S.E: 0.021, p<0.05) during the observation period. Uncertainty stress was positively associated with disease fear ({beta}: 0.45046, S.E: 0.05964, p<0.0001), and negatively associated with self-efficacy ({beta}: -0.6698, S.E: 0.01035, p<0.0001), and prevention behaviors ({beta}: -0.02029, S.E: 0.00876, p: 0.0209). Conclusion This study yielded new information about uncertainty stress among Chinese people during the COVID-19 epidemic. Policy changes and public education are essential for minimizing the negative effects of uncertainty stress in disease prevention.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaozhao Yousef Yang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Sihui Peng","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Tingzhong Yang","author_inst":"Zhejiang university"},{"author_name":"Weifang Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Huihui Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Cottrell Randall R","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Wilmington"},{"author_name":"Saliha Kazci","author_inst":"Ardahan State Hospital, Department of Infectious Disease and Clinical Microbiology, Ardahan, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Mursel Karadavut","author_inst":"Ardahan State Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Ardahan, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Abdullah Gumus","author_inst":"Kafkas University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology, Kars, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Gozde Apaydin","author_inst":"Igdir State Hospital, Department of Pediatric Health and Diseases, Igdir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Necati Mumcu","author_inst":"Igdir State Hospital, Department of Infectious Disease and Clinical Microbiology, Igdir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Onur Coruh","author_inst":"Ardahan State Hospital, Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Ardahan, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Emin Ediz Tutuncu","author_inst":"Kafkas University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Disease and Clinical Microbiology, Kars,"},{"author_name":"Mark Naufel","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Lucas P.

A total of 6 studies included in the meta-analysis. Results The values of d-dimer were found to be significantly increased in patients with the composite clinical end point than in those without (SMD, 1.67 ug\/ml (95% CI, 0.72-2.62 ug\/ml). The SMD of the studies (Tang et al, Zhou et al, Chen et al), which used only mortality as an outcome measure was 2.5 ug\/mL (95% CI, 0.62-4.41).

Since vaccines and therapies are still not available for the population, prevention becomes desperately needed. One important aspect for prevention is the identification and subsequent isolation of contagious specimens. The currently used methods for diagnostics are time consuming and also hindered by the limited availability of reagents and reaction costs, thus presenting a bottle neck for prevention of COVID-19 spread. Here, we present a new ultra-fast test method which is ten times faster than conventional diagnostic tests using real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). In addition, this ultra-fast method is easy to handle as well as cost effective. We translated published SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia, USA) and the Charite Berlin (Germany) to the NEXTGENPCR (NGPCR) machine and combined it with a fluorescence-based endpoint measurement. Fluorescence was measured with a commercial blue light scanner. We confirmed the NEXTGENPCR results with commercially available positive controls. In addition, we isolated RNA from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and achieved similar results to clinical RT-qPCR assays. Here, we could show correlation between the results obtained by NEXTGENPCR and conventional RT-qPCR.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ehsan Asghari","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; AG Molecular Neurobiology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna H\u00f6ving","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; Institute for Laboratory- and Transfusion medicine, Heart- and Diabetes Centre NRW, Ruh"},{"author_name":"Paula van Heijningen","author_inst":"Molecular Biology Systems B.V., Goes, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Annika Kiel","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"},{"author_name":"Angela Kralemann-K\u00f6hler","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"},{"author_name":"Melanie L\u00fctkemeyer","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Storm","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; Evangelisches Klinikum Bethel (EvKB), Bielefeld, Germany; Forschungsverbund Biomedizin "},{"author_name":"Tanja Vollmer","author_inst":"Institute for Laboratory- and Transfusion medicine, Heart- and Diabetes Centre NRW, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Cornelius Knabbe","author_inst":"Institute for Laboratory- and Transfusion medicine, Heart- and Diabetes Centre NRW, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany; Forschungsverbund Biomedizi"},{"author_name":"Barbara Kaltschmidt","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; AG Molecular Neurobiology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; Forschungsverbu"},{"author_name":"Gert de Vos","author_inst":"Molecular Biology Systems B.V., Goes, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Christian Kaltschmidt","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; Forschungsverbund Biomedizin Bielefeld OWL e.V.
