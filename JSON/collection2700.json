Currently, there are many tools to aid in oxygen management and in monitoring viral replication. However, predictive biomarkers for monitoring the host immune response across COVID-19 disease stages and specifically, for titrating immunomodulatory therapy are lacking. We utilized a recently cleared platform (MeMed Key) that enables rapid and easy serial measurement of IP-10, a host protein implicated in lung injury due to viral-induced hyperinflammation. A dynamic clinical decision support protocol was employed for managing SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to a COVID-19 dedicated medical center run by Clalit Health Services. This is the first protocol to include real-time measurements of IP-10 as a potential aid for regulating inflammation. Overall, 502 serial real-time IP-10 measurements were performed on 52 patients recruited between 7th April 2020 to 10th May 2020, with 12 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). IP-10 levels correlated with increased COVID-19 severity score and ICU admission. Within the ICU admitted patients, the number of days with IP-10 measurements >1,000 pg\/ml was associated with mortality. Upon administration of corticosteroid immunomodulatory therapy, a significant decrease in IP-10 levels was observed. Real-time IP-10 monitoring represents a new tool to aid in management and therapeutic decisions relating to the inflammatory status of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaul Lev","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Rabin Medical Center, Hasharon, Petah Tikva, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tamar Gottesman","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Rabin Medical Center, Hasharon, Petah Tikva, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gal Sahaf Levin","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Rabin Medical Center, Hasharon, Petah Tikva, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel"},{"author_name":"Doron Lederfein","author_inst":"Internal Medicine, Rabin Medical Center, Hasharon, Petah Tikva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Evgeny Berkov","author_inst":"Internal Medicine, Rabin Medical Center, Hasharon, Petah Tikva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dror Diker","author_inst":"Internal Medicine, Rabin Medical Center, Hasharon, Petah Tikva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Aliza Zaidman","author_inst":"Internal Medicine, Rabin Medical Center, Hasharon, Petah Tikva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Amir Nutman","author_inst":"National Institute for Infection Control and Antibiotic Resistance, Tel Aviv Medical Centre, Tel-Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tahel Ilan Ber","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Alon Angel","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Lior Kellerman","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eran Barash","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Roy Navon","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Olga Boico","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yael Israeli","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Michal Rosenberg","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Amir Gelman","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Roy Kalfon","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Einav Simon","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Noa Avni","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Mary Hainrichson","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Oren Zarchin","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tanya M.

We aimed to test plausible hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CARDS, and to evaluate the resulting implications for ventilatory management. Design: We adapted a high-fidelity computational simulator, previously validated in several studies of ARDS, to (a) develop quantitative insights into the key pathophysiologic differences between CARDS and conventional ARDS, and (b) assess the impact of different PEEP, FiO2 and tidal volume settings. Setting: Interdisciplinary Collaboration in Systems Medicine Research Network. Subjects: The simulator was calibrated to represent CARDS patients with both normal and elevated body mass indices undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Measurements and Main Results: An ARDS model implementing disruption of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and vasodilation leading to hyperperfusion of collapsed lung regions failed to replicate clinical data on Type 1 CARDS patients. Adding mechanisms to reflect disruption of alveolar gas-exchange due to the effects of pneumonitis, and heightened vascular resistance due to the emergence of microthrombi, produced levels of V\/Q mismatch and hypoxemia consistent with data from Type 1 CARDS patients, while preserving close to normal lung compliance and gas volumes. Atypical responses to PEEP increments between 5 and 15 cmH2O were observed for this Type 1 CARDS model across a range of measures: increasing PEEP resulted in reduced lung compliance and no improvement in oxygenation, while Mechanical Power, Driving Pressure and Plateau Pressure all increased. FiO2 settings based on ARDSnet protocols at different PEEP levels were insufficient to achieve adequate oxygenation. Incrementing tidal volumes from 5 to 10 ml\/kg produced similar increases in multiple indicators of ventilator induced lung injury in the Type 1 CARDS model to those seen in a conventional ARDS model. Conclusions: Our model suggests that use of standard PEEP\/ FiO2 tables, higher PEEP strategies, and higher tidal volumes, may all be potentially deleterious in Type 1 CARDS patients, and that a highly personalized approach to treatment is advisable.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anup Das","author_inst":"University Of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Sina Saffaran","author_inst":"University Of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Marc Chikhani","author_inst":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Timothy Scott","author_inst":"University Hospitals North Midlands, Stoke-On-Trent, UK"},{"author_name":"Marianna Laviola","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Nadir Yehya","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Children Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Penns"},{"author_name":"John Laffey","author_inst":"Galway University Hospitals, Galway, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Jonathan G.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of IPA in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We prospectively screened 32 critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia for a time period of 28 days using a standardized study protocol for oberservation of developement of COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We collected laboratory, microbiological, virological and clinical parameters at defined timepoints in combination with galactomannan-antigen-detection from bronchial aspirates. We used logistic regression analyses to assess if COVID-19 was independently associated with IPA and compared it with matched controls. Findings: CAPA was diagnosed at a median of 4 days after ICU admission in 11\/32 (34%) of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to 8% in the control cohort. In the COVID-19 cohort, mean age, APACHE II score and ICU mortality were higher in patients with CAPA than in patients without CAPA (36% versus 9.5%; p<0.001). ICU stay (21 versus 17 days; p=0.340) and days of mechanical ventilation (20 versus 15 days; p=0.570) were not different between both groups. In regression analysis COVID-19 and APACHE II score were independently associated with IPA. Interpretation: CAPA is highly prevalent and associated with a high mortality rate. COVID-19 is independently associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A standardized screening and diagnostic approach as presented in our study can help to identify affected patients at an early stage.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tobias Lahmer","author_inst":"Klinikum rechts der Isar, TU Muenchen"},{"author_name":"Sina Saffaran","author_inst":"University Of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Marc Chikhani","author_inst":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Timothy Scott","author_inst":"University Hospitals North Midlands, Stoke-On-Trent, UK"},{"author_name":"Marianna Laviola","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Nadir Yehya","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Children Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Penns"},{"author_name":"John Laffey","author_inst":"Galway University Hospitals, Galway, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Jonathan G.

There is a general consensus that the most efficient health protocol in the actual state is to disrupt the infection chain through social distancing, although economic interests stand against closing non-essential activities and poses a debatable tradeoff. In this study, we used an individual-based age-structured network model to assess the effective roles of different healthcare protocols such as the use of personal protection equipment and social distancing at neighbor- and city-level scales. Using as much as empirical data available in the literature, we calibrated a city model and simulated low, medium, and high parameters representing these protocols. Our results revealed that the model was more sensitive to changes in the parameter representing the rate of contact among people from different neighborhoods, which defends the social distancing at the city-level as the most effective protocol for the control of the disease outbreak. Another important identified parameter represented the use of individual equipment such as masks, face shields, and hand sanitizers like alcohol-based solutions and antiseptic products. Interestingly, our simulations suggest that some periodical activities such as going to the supermarket, gas station, and pharmacy would have little contribution to the SARS-CoV-2 spread once performed within the same neighborhood. As we can see nowadays, there is an inevitable context-dependency and economic pressure on the level of social distancing recommendations, and we reinforce that every decision must be a welfare-oriented science-based decision.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matheus T Baumgartner","author_inst":"State University of Maring"},{"author_name":"Fernando M Lansac-Toha","author_inst":"State University of Maring"},{"author_name":"Marc Chikhani","author_inst":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Timothy Scott","author_inst":"University Hospitals North Midlands, Stoke-On-Trent, UK"},{"author_name":"Marianna Laviola","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Nadir Yehya","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Children Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Penns"},{"author_name":"John Laffey","author_inst":"Galway University Hospitals, Galway, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Jonathan G.

Positivity-ratios (cases to tests ratio) in conjunction with cases and tests provide a better overview. However, comprehensive overviews of positivity-ratio patterns are scarce. Objective: To examine trends in positivity-ratios, tests and cases by state from mid-April-mid-July. Further, to examine whether positivity-ratio patters are associated with state political-affiliations. Methods: State-level publicly available data on Covid19 is used. Seven-day moving averages (MA7) of positivity-ratio are computed for April 21-July 15. States are assigned to four groups based on patterns of change in positivity-ratio: higher at end of study period than beginning (Group 1), initial decline but subsequent increase starting Memorial Day weekend (Group 2), initial decrease but an upturn in last 14 days (Group 3), and consistent downward trend (Group 4). Political-affiliation is categorized as <Republican-leaning> if President Trump won the state and the governor is Republican. Additionally, a proxy measure is used to indicate intensity of Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests in the state. Associations are tested using chi-square analysis. Results: Fourteen states are in Group 1, fifteen states in Group 2, fifteen states in Group 3, and six states and DC in Group 4. 78.57% of Group 1, 33.33% of Group 2, 40% of group 3, and none in Group 4 were Republican-leaning. The difference in distribution was statistically significant (p<0.01). Distribution of high-intensity BLM protests across the four groups was not statistically different (p>0.10). Conclusion: Increased Covid19 cases cannot be attributed to more testing. Indeed, the high positivity-ratios in most states indicate current testing is failing to capture actual infection rates. The association between state political-affiliation and positivity-ratios suggests Republican voters may be somewhat more skeptical of the gravity of the disease and emphasizes the importance of messaging by political leaders.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bisakha Pia Sen","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Sangeetha Padalabalanarayanan","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Norihisa Ohtake","author_inst":"Yokohama City University"},{"author_name":"Satoko Matsunaga","author_inst":"Yokohama City University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yutaro Yamaoka","author_inst":"Kanto Chemical Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Mayuko Nishi","author_inst":"Yokohama City University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Morita","author_inst":"Yokohama City University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryo Saji","author_inst":"Yokohama City University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mototsugu Nishii","author_inst":"Yokohama City University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hirokazu Kimura","author_inst":"Gunma Paz University"},{"author_name":"Hideki Hasegawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Ichiro Takeuchi","author_inst":"Yokohama City University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Akihide Ryo","author_inst":"Yokohama City University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Olga Boico","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yael Israeli","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Michal Rosenberg","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Amir Gelman","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Roy Kalfon","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Einav Simon","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Noa Avni","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Mary Hainrichson","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Oren Zarchin","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tanya M.

The semaine de relache, or March break, took place two weeks earlier in Quebec as compared to the rest of Canada. This event may have played a role in the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to examine the role of case importation in the early transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec. Methods: Using detailed surveillance data, we developed and calibrated a deterministic SEIR-type compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We explored the impact of altering the number of imported cases on hospitalizations. Specifically, we investigated scenarios without case importation after March break, and as scenarios where cases were imported with the same frequency\/timing as neighboring Ontario. Results: A total of 1,544 and 1,150 returning travelers were laboratory-confirmed in Quebec and Ontario, respectively (with symptoms onset before 2020-03-25). The cumulative number of hospitalizations could have been reduced by 55% (95% credible interval [95%CrI]: 51-59%) had no cases been imported after Quebec's March break. However, had Quebec experienced Ontario's number of imported cases, cumulative hospitalizations would have only been reduced by 12% (95%CrI: 8-16%). Interpretation: Our results suggest that case importation played an important role in the early spread of COVID-19 in Quebec. Yet, heavy importation of SARS-CoV-2 in early March could be insufficient to resolve interprovincial heterogeneities in cumulative hospitalizations. The importance of other factors -public health preparedness, responses, and capacity- should be investigated.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arnaud Godin","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Yiqing Xia","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"David L Buckeridge","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Dirk Douwes-Schultz","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Yannan Shen","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Maxime Lavigne","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"M\u00e9lanie Drolet","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 Laval"},{"author_name":"Alexandra M Schmidt","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Marc Brisson","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 Laval"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Maheu-Giroux","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ichiro Takeuchi","author_inst":"Yokohama City University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Akihide Ryo","author_inst":"Yokohama City University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Olga Boico","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yael Israeli","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Michal Rosenberg","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Amir Gelman","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Roy Kalfon","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Einav Simon","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Noa Avni","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Mary Hainrichson","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Oren Zarchin","author_inst":"MeMed, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tanya M.

We compared extensive molecular profiles of blood samples from 231 COVID-19 patients, ranging from asymptomatic to critically ill, importantly excluding those with any comorbidities. Amongst the major findings, asymptomatic patients were characterized by highly activated anti-virus interferon, T\/natural killer (NK) cell activation, and transcriptional upregulation of inflammatory cytokine mRNAs. However, given very abundant RNA binding proteins (RBPs), these cytokine mRNAs could be effectively destabilized hence preserving normal cytokine levels. In contrast, in critically ill patients, cytokine storm due to RBPs inhibition and tryptophan metabolites accumulation contributed to T\/NK cell dysfunction. A machine-learning model was constructed which accurately stratified the COVID-19 severities based on their multi-omics features. Overall, our analysis provides insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis and identifies targets for intervening in treatment.","rel_num_authors":68,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"Cancer Biology Research Center (Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education), Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Techno"},{"author_name":"Dongsheng Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wencheng Ding","author_inst":"Cancer Biology Research Center (Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education), Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Techno"},{"author_name":"Ping Wu","author_inst":"Cancer Biology Research Center (Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education), Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Techno"},{"author_name":"Hongyan Hou","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yong Bai","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yuwen Zhou","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China;

There is an incomplete understanding of the host humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 during acute infection. Host factors such as age and sex as well the kinetics and functionality of antibody responses are important factors to consider as vaccine development proceeds. The receptor-binding domain of the CoV spike (RBD-S) protein is important in host cell recognition and infection and antibodies targeting this domain are often neutralizing. In a cross-sectional study of anti-RBD-S antibodies in COVID-19 patients we found equivalent levels in male and female patients and no age-related deficiencies even out to 93 years of age. The anti-RBD-S response was evident as little as 6 days after onset of symptoms and for at least 5 weeks after symptom onset. Anti-RBD-S IgG, IgM, and IgA responses were simultaneously induced within 10 days after onset, but isotype-specific kinetics differed such that anti-RBD-S IgG was most sustained over a 5-week period. The kinetics and magnitude of neutralizing antibody formation strongly correlated with that seen for anti-RBD-S antibodies. Our results suggest age- and sex- related disparities in COVID-19 fatalities are not explained by anti-RBD-S responses. The multi-isotype anti-RBD-S response induced by live virus infection could serve as a potential marker by which to monitor vaccine-induced responses.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nancy R.

We model the testing, isolation and transmission of COVID-19 within quarantine facilities to estimate the risk of community outbreaks being seeded at the border. We use a simple branching process model for COVID-19 transmission that includes a time-dependent probability of a false negative test result. We show that the combination of 14-day quarantine with two tests reduces the risk of releasing an infectious case to around 0.1% per infected arrival. Shorter quarantine periods, or reliance on testing only with no quarantine, substantially increases this risk. We calculate the fraction of cases detected in the second week of their two week stay and show that this may be a useful indicator of the likelihood of transmission occurring within quarantine facilities. Frontline staff working at the border risk exposure to infected individuals and this has the potential to lead to a community outbreak. We use the model to test surveillance strategies and evaluate the likely size of the outbreak at the time it is first detected. We conclude with some recommendations for managing the risk of potential future outbreaks originating from the border.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury, NZ"},{"author_name":"Rachelle N Binny","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Emily A Bruce","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Matthew E.

Moreover, passively administered antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. However, the degree to which SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to evade neutralizing antibodies is unclear. Using a recombinant chimeric VSV\/SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus, we show that functional SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants with mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain that confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma can be readily selected. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S variants that resist commonly elicited neutralizing antibodies are now present at low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations. Finally, the emergence of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants that might limit the therapeutic usefulness of monoclonal antibodies can be mitigated by the use of antibody combinations that target distinct neutralizing epitopes.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yiska Weisblum","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Fabian Schmidt","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Fengwen Zhang","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Justin DaSilva","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Daniel Poston","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Julio C C Lorenzi","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Frauke Muecksch","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Rutkowska","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Hans-Heinrich Hoffmann","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Michailidis","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Christian Gaebler","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Marianna Agudelo","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Alice Cho","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Anna Gazumyan","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cipolla","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Larry Luchsinger","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Davide F Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Charles Rice","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Tropical Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Gang Xie","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xianmei Lan","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Yuan","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Li","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mingxi Huang","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Ding","author_inst":"1.

Nevertheless, a few prevalent variants have arisen that give the appearance of undergoing positive selection as they are becoming increasingly widespread over time. Most prominent among these is the D614G amino acid substitution in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, which mediates viral entry. The D614G substitution, however, is in linkage disequilibrium with the ORF1b P314L mutation where both mutations almost invariably co-occur, making functional inferences problematic. In addition, the possibility of repeated new introductions of the mutant strain does not allow one to distinguish between a founder effect and an intrinsic genetic property of the virus. Here, we synthesized and expressed the WT and D614G variant SARS-Cov2 Spike protein, and report that using a SARS-CoV2 Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral vector we observe that the D614G variant Spike has >1\/2 log10 increased infectivity in human cells expressing the human ACE2 protein as the viral receptor. The increased binding\/fusion activity of the D614G Spike protein was corroborated in a cell fusion assay using Spike and ACE2 proteins expressed in different cells. These results are consistent with the possibility that the Spike D614G mutant increases the infectivity of SARS-CoV2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junko Ogawa","author_inst":"Salk Institute for Biological Studies"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhu","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Nina Tonnu","author_inst":"Salk Institute for Biological Studies"},{"author_name":"Oded Singer","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tony Hunter","author_inst":"Salk Institute for Biological Studies"},{"author_name":"Amy L Ryan (Firth)","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Gerald M Pao","author_inst":"Salk Institute for Biological Studies"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Rutkowska","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Hans-Heinrich Hoffmann","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Michailidis","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Christian Gaebler","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Marianna Agudelo","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Alice Cho","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Anna Gazumyan","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cipolla","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Larry Luchsinger","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Davide F Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Charles Rice","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Tropical Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Gang Xie","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xianmei Lan","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Yuan","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Li","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mingxi Huang","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Ding","author_inst":"1.

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which shares a high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV. Currently there are no vaccinations available to provide protection and the only antiviral therapy in active use in patients is remdesivir, which currently provides only limited benefit. Hence, there is an urgent need for antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV2. SARS-CoV requires Ca2+ ions for host cell entry and based on the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 it is highly likely that the same requirements exist for the two viruses. Here, we tested whether FDA-approved calcium channel blocker (CCB) drugs are efficacious to inhibit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Our data shows that amlodipine, felodipine, and nifedipine limit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in epithelial kidney (Vero E6) and epithelial lung (Calu-3) cells. We observed some differences in the inhibition efficacy of the drugs in the two different cell lines, but with felodipine and nifedipine having the greatest effect. Overall, our data suggest that CCBs have a high potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections and their current FDA approval would allow for a fast repurposing of these drugs.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco R Straus","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Miya Bidon","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Tang","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Gary Whittaker","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Susan Daniel","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Amy L Ryan (Firth)","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Gerald M Pao","author_inst":"Salk Institute for Biological Studies"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Rutkowska","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Hans-Heinrich Hoffmann","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Michailidis","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Christian Gaebler","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Marianna Agudelo","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Alice Cho","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Anna Gazumyan","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cipolla","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Larry Luchsinger","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Davide F Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Charles Rice","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Tropical Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Gang Xie","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xianmei Lan","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Yuan","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Li","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mingxi Huang","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Ding","author_inst":"1.

People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID-19 because their early exposure to oxygen at birth increases their risk of being hospitalized when infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Our prior studies in mice showed how high levels of oxygen (hyperoxia) between postnatal days 0-4 increases the severity of influenza A virus infections by reducing the number of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. Because AT2 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane protease\/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), we expected their expression would decline as AT2 cells were depleted by hyperoxia. Instead, we made the surprising discovery that expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 mRNA increases as mice age and is accelerated by exposing mice to neonatal hyperoxia. ACE2 is primarily expressed at birth by airway Club cells and becomes detectable in AT2 cells by one year of life. Neonatal hyperoxia increases ACE2 expression in Club cells and makes it detectable in 2-month-old AT2 cells. This early and increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was not seen in adult mice who had been administered the mitochondrial superoxide scavenger mitoTEMPO during hyperoxia. Our finding that early life insults such as hyperoxia enhances the age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory epithelium helps explain why COVID-19 lung disease is greater in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Min Yee","author_inst":"The University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Ethan David Cohen","author_inst":"University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Jeannie Haak","author_inst":"The University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Dylag","author_inst":"The University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Susan Daniel","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Amy L Ryan (Firth)","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Gerald M Pao","author_inst":"Salk Institute for Biological Studies"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Rutkowska","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Hans-Heinrich Hoffmann","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Michailidis","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Christian Gaebler","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Marianna Agudelo","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Alice Cho","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Anna Gazumyan","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cipolla","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Larry Luchsinger","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Davide F Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Charles Rice","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Tropical Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Gang Xie","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xianmei Lan","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Yuan","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Li","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mingxi Huang","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Ding","author_inst":"1.

A previously unknown coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. To date, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines or therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and\/or associated COVID-19 disease, which has triggered a large influx of scientific efforts to develop countermeasures to control SARS-CoV-2 spread. To contribute to these efforts, we have developed an infectious cDNA clone of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1\/2020 strain based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC).\n\nRecombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 was readily rescued by transfection of the BAC into Vero E6 cells. Importantly, the BAC-derived rSARS-CoV-2 exhibited growth properties and plaque sizes in cultured cells comparable to those of the SARS-CoV-2 natural isolate. Likewise, rSARS-CoV-2 showed similar levels of replication to that of the natural isolate in nasal turbinates and lungs of infected golden Syrian hamsters. This is, to our knowledge, the first BAC based reverse genetics system for the generation of infectious rSARS-CoV-2 that displays similar features in vivo to that of a natural viral isolate. This SARS-CoV-2 BAC-based reverse genetics will facilitate studies addressing several important questions in the biology of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the identification of antivirals and development of vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chengjin Ye","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jun-Gyu Park","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Fatai Oladunni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy Neal Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Fernando Almazan","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia"},{"author_name":"Juan Carlos de la Torre","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hans-Heinrich Hoffmann","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Michailidis","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Christian Gaebler","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Marianna Agudelo","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Alice Cho","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Anna Gazumyan","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cipolla","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Larry Luchsinger","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Davide F Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Charles Rice","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Tropical Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Gang Xie","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xianmei Lan","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Yuan","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Li","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mingxi Huang","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Ding","author_inst":"1.

In the present study, we identified key recombination regions and mutation sites cross the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and SARS-like CoV clusters of betacoronavirus subgroup B. Based on the analysis of these recombination events, we proposed that the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may have more than one specific receptor for its function. In addition, we reported--for the first time--a recombination event of ORF8 at the whole-gene level in a bat and ultimately determined that ORF8 enhances the viral replication. In conjunction with our previous discoveries, we found that receptor binding abilities, junction furin cleavage sites (FCSs), strong first ribosome binding sites (RBSs) and enhanced ORF8s are main factors contributing to transmission, virulence and host adaptability of CoVs. Junction FCSs and enhanced ORF8s increase the efficiencies in viral entry into cells and replication, respectively while strong first RBSs enhance the translational initiation. The strong recombination ability of CoVs integrated these factors to generate multiple recombinant strains, two of which evolved into SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by nature selection, resulting in the SARS and COVID-19 pandemics.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Li","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, Tianjin 300071, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Xiufeng Jin","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, Tianjin 300071, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Shunmei Chen","author_inst":"Yunnan Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Biomedical Engineering Research Center, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan 650500, P.R.Ch"},{"author_name":"Liangge Wang","author_inst":"Taikang Xianlin Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210046, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Tung On Yau","author_inst":"John Van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, NG11 8NS, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jianyi Yang","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, Tianjin 300071, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Zhangyong Hong","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, Tianjin 300071, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Jishou Ruan","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, Tianjin 300071, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Guangyou Duan","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Qilu Normal University, Jinan, Shandong 250200, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Shan Gao","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, Tianjin 300071, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Christian Gaebler","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Marianna Agudelo","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Alice Cho","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Anna Gazumyan","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cipolla","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Larry Luchsinger","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Davide F Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Charles Rice","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Tropical Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Gang Xie","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xianmei Lan","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Yuan","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Li","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mingxi Huang","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Ding","author_inst":"1.

However, human clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine failed to establish its usefulness as treatment for COVID-19. This compound is known to interfere with endosomal acidification necessary to the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. Following receptor binding and endocytosis, cathepsin L can cleave the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins, thereby activating membrane fusion for cell entry. The plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 can similarly cleave these S proteins and activate viral entry at the cell surface. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 entry process is more dependent than that of SARS-CoV-1 on TMPRSS2 expression. This difference can be reversed when the furin-cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is ablated. We also show that hydroxychloroquine efficiently blocks viral entry mediated by cathepsin L, but not by TMPRSS2, and that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically-tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection more potently than either drug alone. These studies identify functional differences between SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry processes, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited in vivo utility of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe novel pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 and remains a threat to global public health. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to prevent viral infection in cell-culture systems, but human clinical trials did not observe a significant improvement in COVID-19 patients treated with these compounds. Here we show that hydroxychloroquine interferes with only one of two somewhat redundant pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is activated to mediate infection. The first pathway is dependent on the endosomal protease cathepsin L and sensitive to hydroxychloroquine, whereas the second pathway is dependent on TMPRSS2, which is unaffected by this compound. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 is more reliant than SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) on the TMPRSS2 pathway, and that this difference is due to a furin cleavage site present in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Finally, we show that combinations of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor work together to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry. Thus TMPRSS2 expression on physiologically relevant SARS-CoV-2 target cells may bypass the antiviral activities of hydroxychloroquine, and explain its lack of in vivo efficacy.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tianling Ou","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Huihui Mou","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lizhou Zhang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amrita Ojha","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hyeryun Choe","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Farzan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Zhangyong Hong","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, Tianjin 300071, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Jishou Ruan","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, Tianjin 300071, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Guangyou Duan","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Qilu Normal University, Jinan, Shandong 250200, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Shan Gao","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, Tianjin 300071, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Christian Gaebler","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Marianna Agudelo","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Alice Cho","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Anna Gazumyan","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cipolla","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Larry Luchsinger","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Davide F Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Charles Rice","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Tropical Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Gang Xie","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xianmei Lan","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Yuan","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Li","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mingxi Huang","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China; 2.BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Ding","author_inst":"1.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, which is mediated by the viral spike protein and host ACE2 receptor, is an essential target for the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and drugs. Using a mammalian cell expression system, we generated a recombinant fluorescent protein (Gamillus)-fused SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer (STG) to probe the viral entry process. In ACE2-expressing cells, we found that the STG probe has excellent performance in the live-cell visualization of receptor binding, cellular uptake, and intracellular trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 under virus-free conditions. The new system allows quantitative analyses of the inhibition potentials and detailed influence of COVID-19-convalescent human plasmas, neutralizing antibodies and compounds, providing a versatile tool for high-throughput screening and phenotypic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. This approach may also be adapted to develop a viral entry visualization system for other viruses.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yali Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of

The unavailability of a specific treatment regime and a candidate vaccine yet opens up scope for new approaches and discoveries of drugs for mitigation of the sufferings of humankind due to the disease. The present isolated whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 11 different nations subjected to evolutionary study and genome-wide association study through in silico approaches including multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic study through MEGA7 and have been analyzed through DNAsp respectively. These investigations recognized the nucleotide varieties and single nucleotide mutations\/polymorphisms on the genomic regions as well as protein-coding regions. The resulted mutations have diversified the genomic contents of SARS-CoV-2 according to the altered nucleotides found in 11 genome sequences. India and Nepal have found to have progressively more distinct species of SARS-CoV-2 with variations in Spike protein and Nucleocapsid protein-coding sites. These genomic variations might be the explanation behind the less case fatality rate of India and Nepal dependent on the populaces. The anticipated idea of this investigation upgrades the information about genomic medication and might be useful in the planning of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manisha Ray","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Saurav Sarkar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Surya Narayan Rath","author_inst":"OUAT"},{"author_name":"Mukund Namdev Sable","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Lunzhi Yuan","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Juan Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jianghui Ye","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qingbing Zheng","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Ma","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Xu","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Wei","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zonglin Li","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Sheng Nian","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Hualong Xiong","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yang Shi","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baorong Fu","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jiali Cao","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Chuanlai Yang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Yang","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Hai Yu","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jianda Hu","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yixin Chen","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianying Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tong Cheng","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Kang Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China;

Living and working conditions are highly conducive for transmission, as people live in crowded inter-generational households that often lack running water and other basic sanitary facilities. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of Ethiopians toward COVID-19 following the introduction of state of emergency by the Ethiopian government to curb the spread of the disease. A cross-sectional study design was conducted in nine reginal states and two chartered cities. Data for demographic, Knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through telephone interview from 1570 participants. Descriptive and bivariate analyses using chi-square test, t-test or analysis of variance were performed as appropriate. Binary and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to measure the relationship between the categorical dependent variables and one or more socio-demographic independent variables with two-tailed at =0.05 significance level and 95% of confidence interval. The level of good knowledge, favourable attitude and good practice among the respondents were 42%, 53.8% and 24.3% respectively. Being rural resident, older than 50 years, having at least primary education, being resident of Amhara and Oromia regions were independent predictors of knowledge level. While being rural resident, married, employed, having at least basic education, being residents of Afar, Amhara, Gambela, Oromia and Somali regions were found to be the best predictors of the attitude, being rural resident, government employee, having at least basic education, and living outside of the capital were the independent predictors of practice level of the respondents. The finding revealed that Ethiopians have inadequate level of knowledge and are generally have a mixed outlook on overcoming the pandemic with poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention practice. reinforcing preventive measures and intensifying sensitization campaigns to fill the knowledge gap and persuading people to follow the preventive measures set by the government with concurrent evaluation of the impacts of these measures on knowledge and practice is highly recommended to mitigate the disease.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edessa

The main objective of Governments worldwide is to control the extent of the outbreak until a vaccine or cure has been devised. Machine learning has been an efficient mechanism to train, map, analyze, and predict datasets. This paper aims to utilize regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm to assess time-series datasets of COVID-19 pandemic by performing comparative analysis on datasets of India and two Municipal Corporations of Maharashtra, namely, Mira-Bhayander and Akola. This study's current contribution is an attempt towards drawing attention to the dynamics of the pandemic in a controlled locality such as Municipal Corporation. The results of the current study depicts that growth of COVID-19 cases is exponential when considered nationally, however, for limited area the nature of curve is observed to be cubic for total cases and multi-peak Gaussian for active cases. In conclusion, Government should empower district\/ corporations to adopt their own methodology and decisionmaking policy to contain the pandemic at regional-level like in the case of Dharavi.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Naman S.

Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Objective: This work is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID pandemic. Data Sources and Study design: In this study, We have used a survey of 17764 adults in the USA at different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Methods: Through initial statistical analysis followed by Bayesian Network inference, we have identified key factors affecting Mental health during the COVID pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches lead to effective modeling of the level of mental health. Results: Overall, females are more stressed than males, and people of age-group 18-29 are more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian Network Model, we found that people with chronic medical condition of mental illness are more prone to mental disorders during the COVID age. The new realities of working from home, home-schooling, and lack of communication with family\/friends\/neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during COVID generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised ML models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Indra Prakash Jha","author_inst":"IIIT Delhi"},{"author_name":"Raghav Awasthi","author_inst":"IIIT D"},{"author_name":"Ajit Kumar","author_inst":"Adobe Inc"},{"author_name":"Vibhor Kumar","author_inst":"IIITD"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Juan Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jianghui Ye","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qingbing Zheng","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Ma","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Xu","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Wei","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zonglin Li","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Sheng Nian","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Hualong Xiong","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yang Shi","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baorong Fu","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jiali Cao","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Chuanlai Yang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Yang","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Hai Yu","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jianda Hu","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yixin Chen","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianying Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tong Cheng","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Kang Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"1.BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China;

In May, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies for nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 among the residents of Blaine County, Idaho, a ski resort community with high COVID-19 attack rates in late March and Early April (2.9% for ages 18 and older). Participants were selected from volunteers who registered via a secure web link, using prestratification weighting to the population distribution by age and gender within each ZIP Code. Participants completed a survey reporting their demographics and symptoms; 88% of volunteers who were invited to participate completed data collection survey and had 10 ml of blood drawn. Serology was completed via the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay. Primary analyses estimated seroprevalence and 95% credible intervals (CI) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for diagnostic uncertainty. Stratified models were run by age, sex, ZIP Code, ethnicity, employment status, and a priori participant-reported COVID-19 status. Sensitivity analyses to estimate seroprevalence included base models with post-stratification for ethnicity, age, and sex, with or without adjustment for multi-participant households. IgG antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 were found among 22.7% (95% CI: 20.1%, 25.5%) of residents of Blaine County. Higher levels of antibodies were found among residents of the City of Ketchum 34.8% (95% CI 29.3%, 40.5%), compared to Hailey 16.8% (95%CI 13.7%, 20.3%) and Sun Valley 19.4% (95% 11.8%, 28.4%). People who self-identified as not believing they had COVID-19 had the lowest prevalence 4.8% (95% CI 2.3%, 8.2%). The range of seroprevalence after correction for potential selection bias was 21.9% to 24.2%. This study suggests more than 80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were not reported. Although Blaine County had high levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the community is not yet near the herd immunity threshold.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colleen McLaughlin","author_inst":"Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Margaret K.

Our goal was to identify risk factors associated with admission and disease severity in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Design: This was an observational, retrospective study based on real-world data for 7,995 patients with SARS-CoV-2 from a clinical data repository. Setting: Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) is a five-hospital academic health system serving a diverse patient population with community and teaching facilities in both urban and suburban areas. Populations: The study included adult patients who had SARS-CoV-2 testing at YNHH between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Main outcome and performance measures: Primary outcomes were admission and in-hospital mortality for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by RT-PCR testing. We also assessed features associated with the need for respiratory support. Results: Of the 28605 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 7995 patients (27.9%) had an infection (median age 52.3 years) and 2154 (26.9%) of these had an associated admission (median age 66.2 years). Of admitted patients, 1633 (75.8%) had a discharge disposition at the end of the study period. Of these, 192 (11.8%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 227 (13.5%) expired. Increased age and male sex were positively associated with admission and in-hospital mortality (median age 81.9 years), while comorbidities had a much weaker association with the risk of admission or mortality. Black race (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.14-1.78) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.50-2.18) were identified as risk factors for admission, but, among discharged patients, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. Conclusions: This observational study identified, among people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, older age and male sex as the most strongly associated risks for admission and in-hospital mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While minority racial and ethnic groups had increased burden of disease and risk of admission, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality for discharged patients was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups.

It is used to guide officials in their response to an epidemic. This research demonstrates an effective and simple approach that estimates the parameters of any variations of the SEIR model. This new technique will be demonstrated on the spread of COVID-19 in Libya. Methods: A five compartmental epidemic model is used to model the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya. Two sets of data are needed to evaluate the model parameters, the cumulative number of symptomatic cases and the total number of active cases. This data along with the assumption that the cumulative number of symptomatic cases grows exponentially, to determine most of the model parameters. Results: Libya epidemic start-date was estimated as t_o=-18.5 days, corresponding to May 5th. We mathematically demonstrated that the number of active cases follows two competing exponential distributions: a positive exponential function, measuring how many new cases are added, and a negative exponential function, measuring how many cases recovered. From this distribution we showed that the average recovery time is 48 days, and the incubation period is 15.2 days. Finally, the productive number was estimated as R0 = 7.6. Conclusions: With only the cumulative number of cases and the total number of active cases of COVID19, several important SEIR model parameters can be measured effectively. This approach can be applied for any infectious disease epidemic anywhere in the world.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed E Saleh","author_inst":"Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University"},{"author_name":"Zeinab Elmehdi Saleh","author_inst":"University of Tripoli, Community and Family Medicine Department"},{"author_name":"Erhei Dai","author_inst":"Division of Liver Disease, The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Haolong Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Guodong Tang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Beijing Hospital of the Ministry of Health, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Lixia Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Haihe University, Tianjin, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Hou","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Minya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xian Wu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Simeng Duan","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jingjia Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Charles S.

The use of commercially available personal face masks was widely accepted as such a protective measure. Since the quality of the face masks scanned the spectrum from surgical to the home made fabric ones, it was considered appropriate to experimentally establish their effectiveness for stopping aerosol in entering the respiratory system of the bearer. Presently, the masks were tested with polydisperse indoor air. Their effectiveness was examined for aerosol of aerodynamic diameters of 0.006 m to 10 m. Of these masks, only two were effective for the whole range of aerosol. Cloth masks were found to be ineffective for the whole spectrum of aerosol particle sizes and especially in SARS-CoV-2 virus most abundant size range.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Glykeria Loupa","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace, Greece"},{"author_name":"Dimitra Karali","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace, Greece"},{"author_name":"SPYRIDON RAPSOMANIKIS","author_inst":"DEMOCRITUS UNIIVERSITY OF THRACE"},{"author_name":"Lucretia Jones","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Gretchen M.
