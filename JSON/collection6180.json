However, short and\/or overlapping genes can be difficult to detect using conventional computational approaches, whereas high throughput experimental approaches - such as ribosome profiling - cannot distinguish translation of functional peptides from regulatory translation or translational noise. By studying regions showing enhanced conservation at synonymous sites in alignments of SARS-CoV and related viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus), and correlating with the conserved presence of an open reading frame and plausible translation mechanism, we identified a putative new gene, ORF3a*, overlapping ORF3a in an alternative reading frame. A recently published ribosome profiling study confirmed that ORF3a* is indeed translated during infection. ORF3a* is conserved across the subgenus Sarbecovirus, and encodes a 40-41 amino acid predicted transmembrane protein.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew E Firth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.091298","rel_title":"Characterization of neutralizing antibodies from a SARS-CoV-2 infected individual","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.091298","rel_abs":"B cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 S envelope glycoprotein spike were isolated from a COVID-19-infected subject using a stabilized spike-derived ectodomain (S2P) twenty-one days post-infection. Forty-four S2P-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated, three of which bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The antibodies were minimally mutated from germline and were derived from different B cell lineages. Only two antibodies displayed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. The most potent antibody bound the RBD in a manner that prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Our study indicates that the majority of antibodies against the viral envelope spike that were generated during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection are non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive maturation. Such antibodies have potential preventive\/therapeutic potential and can serve as templates for vaccine-design.\n\nIN BRIEFSARS-CoV-2 infection leads to expansion of diverse B cells clones against the viral spike glycoprotein (S).

The prefusion Spike protein (S) is a large trimeric protein where each protomer may be in a so-called Up state or Down state, depending on the configuration of its receptor binding domain (RBD). The Up state is believed to allow binding of the virion to ACE-2 receptors on human epithelial cells, whereas the Down state is believed to be relatively inactive or reduced in its binding behavior. We have performed detailed all-atom, dominant energy landscape mappings for noncovalent interactions (charge, partial charge, and van der Waals) of the SARS-Cov-2 Spike protein in its static prefusion state based on recent structural information. We included both interchain interactions and intrachain (domain) interactions in our mappings in order to determine any telling differences (different so-called \"glue\" points) between residues in the Up and Down state protomers. In general, the S2 or fusion machinery domain of S is relatively rigid with strong noncovalent interactions facilitated by helical secondary structures, whereas the S1 domain, which contains the RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD), is relatively more flexible and characterized by beta strand structural motifs. The S2 domain demonstrated no appreciable energetic differences between Up and Down protomers, including interchain as well as each protomers intrachain, S1-S2 interactions. However, the S1 domain interactions across neighboring protomers, which include the RBD-NTD cross chain interactions, showed significant energetic differences between Up-Down and Down-Down neighboring protomers. Surprisingly, the Up-Down, RBD-NTD interactions were overall stronger and more numerous than the Down-Down cross chain interactions, including the appearance of the three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 associated with a turn structure in the RBD of the Up state protomer. Additionally, our intrachain dominant energy mappings within each protomer, identified a significant \"glue\" point or possible \"latch\" for the Down state protomer between the S1 subdomain, SD1, and the RBD domain of the same protomer that was completely missing in the Up state protomer analysis. Ironically, this dominant energetic interaction in the Down state protomer involved the backbone atoms of the same three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 of the RBD with the R-group of GLN564 in the SD1 domain. Thus, this same three residue sequence acts as a stabilizer of the RBD in the Up conformation through its interactions with its neighboring NTD chain and a kind of latch in the Down state conformation through its interactions with its own SD1 domain. The dominant interaction energy residues identified here are also conserved across reported variations of SARS-Cov-2, as well as the closely related virions SARS-Cov and the bat corona virus RatG13. To help verify the potential latch for the Down state protomer, we conducted some preliminary molecular dynamic simulations that effectively turn off this specific latch glue point via a single point mutation of GLN564. Interestingly, the single point mutation lead to the latch releasing in less than a few nanoseconds, but the latch remained fixed in the wild state protomer for up to 0.1 microseconds that were simulated. Many more detailed studies are needed to understand the dynamics of the Up and Down states of the Spike protein, including the stabilizing chain-chain interactions and the mechanisms of transition from Down to Up state protomers. Nonetheless, static dominant energy landscape mappings and preliminary molecular dynamic studies given here may represent a useful starting point for more detailed dynamic analyses and hopefully an improved understanding of the structure-function relationship of this highly complex protein associated with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael H Peters","author_inst":"Virginia Commonwealth University"},{"author_name":"Oscar Bastidas","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Daniel S.

The Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) (https:\/\/covid19.cpmbiodev.net\/) is a comprehensive genomic resource that provides access to full-length SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes and associated meta-data for over 30,000 (as of May 20, 2020) isolates collected from global sequencing repositories and the sequencing performed at the Center for Personalized Medicine (CPM) at CHLA. Reference phylogenetic trees of global and USA viral isolates were constructed and are periodically updated using selected high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. These provide the baseline and analytical context for identifying the origin of a viral infection, as well as the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 genomes of interest. A web-based and interactive Phylogenetic Tree Browser supports flexible tree manipulation and advanced analysis based on keyword search while highlighting time series animation, as well as subtree export for graphical representation or offline exploration. A Virus Genome Tracker accepts complete or partial SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, compares it against all available sequences in the database (>30,000 at time of writing), detects and annotates the variants, and places the new viral isolate within the global or USA phylogenetic contexts based upon variant profiles and haplotype comparisons, in a few seconds. The generated analysis can potentially aid in genomic surveillance to trace the transmission of any new infection. Using CHLA CARD, we demonstrate the identification of a candidate outbreak point where 13 of 31 CHLA internal isolates may have originated. We also discovered multiple indels of unknown clinical significance in the orf3a gene, and revealed a number of USA-specific variants and haplotypes.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael H Peters","author_inst":"Virginia Commonwealth University"},{"author_name":"Oscar Bastidas","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Daniel S.

Lethal complications are caused by damage and failure of vital organs that express high levels of ACE2, including the lungs, the heart and the kidneys. Here, we established a high-throughput drug screening strategy to identify therapeutic candidates that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiac cells. Drug target analysis of validated hit compounds, including 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. Treatment with the 5 alpha reductase inhibitor dutasteride reduced ACE2 levels and internalization of recombinant spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD) in hESC-derived cardiac cells and human alveolar epithelial cells. Finally, clinical data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients demonstrated that abnormal androgen states are significantly associated with severe disease complications and cardiac injury as measured by blood troponin T levels.

However, unlike any of the previous global outbreaks the availability of a large number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences provides us with a unique opportunity to understand viral evolution in real time. We analysed 1448 full-length (>29000 nt) sequences available and identified 40 single-nucleotide substitutions occurring in >1% of the genomes. Majority of the substitutions were C to T or G to A. We identify C\/Gs with an upstream TTT trinucleotide motif as hotspots for mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Interestingly, three of the 40 substitutions occur within highly conserved secondary structures in the 5 and 3 regions of the genomic RNA that are critical for the virus life cycle. Furthermore, clustering analysis revealed unique geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants defined by their mutation profile. Of note, we observed several co-occurring mutations that almost never occur individually. We define five mutually exclusive lineages (A1, B1, C1, D1 and E1) of SARS-CoV-2 which account for about three quarters of the genomes analysed. We identify lineage-defining leading mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which precede the occurrence of sub-lineage defining trailing mutations. The identification of mutually exclusive lineage-defining mutations with geographically restricted patterns of distribution has potential implications for diagnosis, pathogenesis and vaccine design. Our work provides novel insights on the temporal evolution of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nImportanceThe SARS-CoV-2 \/ COVID-19 pandemic has spread far and wide with high infectivity. However, the severeness of the infection as well as the mortality rates differ greatly across different geographic areas. Here we report high frequency mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes which show the presence of linage-defining, leading and trailing mutations. Moreover, we propose for the first time, five mutually exclusive clusters of SARS-CoV-2 which account for 75% of the genomes analysed. This will have implications in diagnosis, pathogenesis and vaccine design","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akhilesh Mishra","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh Kumar Pandey","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Parul Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Prashant Pradhan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sonam Dhamija","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"James Gomes","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bishwajit Kundu","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Perumal Vivekanandan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manoj B.

Phylogenetic analyses and functional assays revealed that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins also encode truncated ORF3b gene products with strong anti-interferon activity. Furthermore, analyses of more than 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identified a natural variant, in which a longer ORF3b reading frame was reconstituted.

Extensive contact tracing and testing in South Korea allows us to investigate the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 into diverse local communities. Objective. Understand the critical aspects of transmission dynamics in a different age, sex, and clusters with various activities. Methods. We conducted a retrospective observational study with 3,127 confirmed cases' contact tracing data from the Center for Disease and Prevention (CDC) of South Korea. We investigated network property concerning infected persons' demographics and different infection clusters. Findings. Overall, women had higher centrality scores than men after week four, when the confirmed cases rapidly increased. Older adults have higher centrality than young\/middle-aged adults after week 9. In the infection clusters, young\/middle-aged adults' infection clusters (such as religious gatherings and gym facilities) have higher average path lengths and diameter than older adults' nursing home infection clusters. Interpretation. Some women had higher reproduction numbers and bridged successive transmission than men when the confirmed cases rapidly increased. Similarly, some older adults (who were not residents of nursing homes) had higher reproduction numbers and bridged successive transmission than young\/middle-aged adults after the peak has passed. The young\/middle-aged adults' religious gatherings and group workout have caused long successive transmissions. In contrast, the older adults' nursing homes were a small world where the transmissions within a few steps can reach out to many persons.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yejin Kim","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqian Jiang","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Keiya Uriu","author_inst":"Division of Systems Virology, Department of Infectious Disease Control, International Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Institute of Medical Science, the"},{"author_name":"Masaya Fukushi","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University"},{"author_name":"Takashi Irie","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University"},{"author_name":"Yoshio Koyanagi","author_inst":"Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"So Nakagawa","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Life Science, Tokai University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kei Sato","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Manoj B.

(1,2) Although testing was initially focused on the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic patients, this effort has now expanded to include surveillance of asymptomatic patients in order to protect health care workers and prevent nosocomial infections. There is an urgent need to understand best practices for the delivery of routine medical care during an ongoing outbreak. (3) Here we report the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients screened prior to admission or a surgical or aerosolizing procedure. Methods Beginning March 30, 2020, our hospital began screening all asymptomatic patients prior to needed surgeries and aerosolizing procedures (n=350). On April 13, 2020, we expanded this practice to universal surveillance screening of all patients prior to admission (n=349). Testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using the Washington state emergency use authorized University of Washington CDC-based laboratory-developed test or FDA authorized DiaSorin Simplexa SARS-CoV-2, Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2, or Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 tests. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Washington Medical Center (STUDY00009734). Informed consent was not required. Results For patients undergoing surgical or aerosolizing procedures, 3 of 350 patients (0.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. For patients who were asymptomatic and tested at the time of admission, 3 of 349 patients (0.9%) were positive and 2 of 349 (0.6%) were inconclusive; inconclusive results were treated as low-level positives. For asymptomatic patients tested for any other reason (e.g. exposure risk), 12 of 157 patients (7.6%) were positive and 1 of 157 (0.6%) were inconclusive. Meanwhile, of the 473 inpatients in this period who had any symptom concerning for COVID-19, 68 of 473 patients (14.3%) were positive. There was a variety of ordering services and locations in all indication categories, with no particular predominating medical service or location. During this time period the outpatient prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 active infection in our region was 3-5% (manuscript in review). Discussion The application of universal surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients prior to surgery or aerosolizing procedure shows that the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 is low (<1%) in asymptomatic patients without known exposure risk factors. The positivity rate for asymptomatic patients on admission screen was similar; both measures were notably lower than recently reported measurements during an outbreak in New York City that found a positivity rate of 13.7% in asymptomatic pregnant women. (4) The rate of sub-clinical infection likely varies with the scale of the community outbreak. Even in the context of a community-wide outbreak, our data show a low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the urgent pre-procedural setting. These data reflect the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population of individuals who use medical services and provide an assessment of exposure risk to other patients and healthcare workers around the time of admission. The Greater Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) also recently published results from the first 18 days of home-based testing and reported no positive tests in 1392 patients reporting no COVID-19-like illness. (5) Although other studies support a large proportion of asymptomatic infections, the data from this metropolitan outbreak do not support a similar pattern. Clinical providers, especially those involved in performing procedures that have a risk of aerosolization, are asking for methods to risk-assess patients prior to the procedure. Pre-procedure testing is one option to accomplish this goal. Importantly, in the midst of an outbreak, testing prior to procedures can decrease the use of PPE, identify appropriate precautions for patients, and reduce the risk of nosocomial infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James A Mays","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alexander L Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"John B Lynch","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Yoshio Koyanagi","author_inst":"Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"So Nakagawa","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Life Science, Tokai University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kei Sato","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Manoj B.

The objective of this manuscript is to study the relation of population demographics, social characteristics, and social distancing on the number of infections and deaths in the US. Methods Data came from publicly available sources. Social distancing was measured by the change in the rate of human encounters per km2 relative to the pre-COVID-19 national average. A smooth generalized additive model for counts of total infections and deaths at US county-level included population demographics, social characteristics, and social distancing. Results The model strongly predicted the geo-spatial variations in COVID-19 infections and deaths, 97.2% of variation in infections and 99.3% of variation in deaths from March 15, 2020. US counties with higher population density, poverty index, civilian population, and minorities, especially African Americans, had a higher rate of infections and deaths, and social distancing was associated with a slower rate of infections and deaths. The number of people infected was increasing; however, the rate of increase of new infections was showing signs of plateauing from the second week of April. Our model estimates that 1,865,580 US residents will test positive for infections and 117,246 fatalities by June 1, 2020. Importantly, our model suggests significant social differences in the infections and deaths across US communities. Areas with a larger African American population and a higher poverty index are expected to show higher rates of infections and deaths. Conclusion Preventive steps, including social distancing and community closures, have been a cornerstone in slowing the transmission and potentially reducing the spread of the disease. Crucial knowledge of the role of social characteristics in disease transmission is essential to understand and predict current and future disease distribution and plan additional preventive steps.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kumar Rajan","author_inst":"University of California at Davis"},{"author_name":"Klodian Dhana","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lisa L Barnes","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Neelum T Aggarwal","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Laura Evans","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Robert S Wilson","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Weuve","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Charles DeCarli","author_inst":"University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Denis A Evans","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Hongyu Zhao","author_inst":"Yale"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Natarajan","author_inst":"Broad institute"},{"author_name":"Hani Goodarzi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Faranak Fattahi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Judith Burger","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Edith Schermer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20092882","rel_title":"The characteristics and death risk factors of 132 COVID-19 pneumonia patients with comorbidities: a retrospective single center analysis in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20092882","rel_abs":"Background: The new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic disease, and the epidemiological characteristics of the disease have been reported in detail. However, many patients with new coronary pneumonia have comorbidities, and there are few researches reported in this special population. Methods: a retrospective analysis was performed on 132 consecutive COVID-19 patients with comorbidities from January 19, 2020 to March 7, 2020 in Hubei NO.3 People Hospital. Patients were divided into mild group and critical group and were followed up to the clinical endpoint. The observation biomarkers include the clinical feature, blood routine, blood biochemistry, inflammation biomarkers, and coagulation function. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors associated with death. Results: 132 patients were enrolled in this study and divided into the mild group (n=109, 82.6%) and critical group (n=23, 17.4%), of whom 119 were discharged and 13 were died in hospital. The all-cause mortality rate was 9.8%, of which 7 patients died of respiratory failure, 5 patients died of heart failure, and 1 patient died of chronic renal failure. There was significant statistical difference of mortality rates between the mild group (5.5%) and the critical group (30.4%).The average time of hospitalization was 16.9 (9, 22) days. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (n=90, 68.2%), followed by diabetes (n=45, 34.1%), coronary heart disease (31, 23.5%). Compared with the mild group, the patients were older in critical group (P <0.05), and neutrophils, neutrophil ratio, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), serum urea nitrogen (BUN), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein CRP), serum amyloid protein (SSA), N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-pro BNP) were significantly increased (P <0.05). However, lymphocytes lymphocyte ratio, albumin were lower than those in the critical group (P <0.05). The patients were further divided into the survivor group (n=119, 90.2%) and the non-survivor group (n=13, 9.8%). Compared with the survivor group, the death rate of patients with coronary heart disease was significantly increased (53.8% vs 20.2%), and The neutrophil ratio, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), BUN, PCT, CRP, SAA, interleukin-6(IL-6) and D-dimer were significantly increased (P <0.05), while the lymphocytes and NLR reduced (P <0.05). Multivariate logistic stepwise regression analysis showed that the past medical history of coronary heart disease[OR:2.806 95%CI:0.971~16.795], decreased lymphocytes[OR:0.040, 95%CI:0.001~2.306], increased AST[OR:1.026, 95%CI:1.000~1.052], increased SSA[OR:1.021, 95%CI:1.001~1.025], and increased D-dimer[OR:1.231, 95%CI:1.042~1.456] are risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 patients pneumonia with comorbidities. Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with coronary heart disease is relatively high. In all patients, the lower lymphocytes, and higher NLR, BUN, PCT, CRP, SSA, D-dimer are significant characteristics. The past medical history of coronary heart disease, decreased lymphocytes, increased AST, SSA and D-dimer are risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 pneumonia patients with comorbidities","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen Chen","author_inst":"Hubei No.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University,Wuhan,Hubei,P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Zhang Jing Yi","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Li Chang","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Hu Zhi Shuo","author_inst":"Wuhan NO.1Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhang Ming","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Tu Pei","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Liu Lei","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Zong Wen Xia","author_inst":"Hubei No.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan university"},{"author_name":"Denis A Evans","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Hongyu Zhao","author_inst":"Yale"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Natarajan","author_inst":"Broad institute"},{"author_name":"Hani Goodarzi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Faranak Fattahi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Judith Burger","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Edith Schermer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20089268","rel_title":"Characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women hospitalised with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK: a national cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS)","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20089268","rel_abs":"Objective: To describe a national cohort of pregnant women hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK, identify factors associated with infection and describe outcomes, including transmission of infection, for mother and infant. Design: Prospective national population-based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS). Setting: All 194 obstetric units in the UK Participants: 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection between 01\/03\/2020 and 14\/04\/2020. 694 comparison women who gave birth between 01\/11\/2017 and 31\/10\/2018. Main outcome measures: Incidence of maternal hospitalisation, infant infection. Rates of maternal death, level 3 critical care unit admission, preterm birth, stillbirth, early neonatal death, perinatal death; odds ratios for infected versus comparison women. Results: Estimated incidence of hospitalisation with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy 4.9 per 1000 maternities (95%CI 4.5-5.4). The median gestation at symptom onset was 34 weeks (IQR 29-38). Black or other minority ethnicity (aOR 4.49, 95%CI 3.37-6.00), older maternal age (aOR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.81 comparing women aged 35+ with those aged 30-34), overweight and obesity (aORs 1.91, 95%CI 1.37-2.68 and 2.20, 95%CI 1.56-3.10 respectively compared to women with a BMI<25kg\/m2) and pre-existing comorbidities (aOR 1.52, 95%CI 1.12-2.06) were associated with admission with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. 247 women (58%) gave birth or had a pregnancy loss; 180 (73%) gave birth at term. 40 (9%) hospitalised women required respiratory support. Twelve infants (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, six of these infants within the first 12 hours after birth. Conclusions: The majority of pregnant women hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 were in the late second or third trimester, supporting guidance for continued social distancing measures in later pregnancy. Most had good outcomes and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to infants was uncommon. The strong association between admission with infection and black or minority ethnicity requires urgent investigation and explanation.

Since COVID-19 outbreak, various agents have been tested but no proven effective therapies have been identified. This has led to a lot of controversies among associated researches. Hence, in order to address the issue of using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating COVID-19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods. A thorough search was carried out to find relevant studies in MEDLINE, medRxiv, PubMed, Cochrane Database, China Academic Journals Full-text Database and Web of Science. Two investigators independently reviewed 274 abstracts and 23 articles. The trials which evaluated HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 were included for this systematic review. Two investigators assessed quality of the studies and data extraction was done by one reviewer and cross checked by the other. Results. Five trials involving 677 patients were included while conducting the meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, HCQ with or without azithromycin (AZI) showed benefits in viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio (OR) 1.95, 95% CI 0.19-19.73) and a reduction in progression rate (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58-1.37), but without demonstrating any statistical significance. This systematic review has also suggested a possible synergistic effect of the combination therapy which included HCQ and AZI. However, the use of HCQ was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions. The use of HCQ with or without AZI for treatment of COVID-19 patients, seems to be effective. The combination of HCQ and AZI has shown synergistic effects. However, mortality rate was increased when the treatment was conducted with HCQ.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tzu-Han Yang","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chian-Ying Chou","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi-Fan Yang","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ping Yang","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chian-Shiu Chien","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aliaksandr A.

While the medical community understands the mode of viral transmission, less is known about how long viral shedding occurs once viral symptoms have resolved. Objective: To determine how long the SARS-CoV-2 remains detectable following self-reporting of viral symptom resolution. Design: A cohort of 86 previously SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were re-tested for proof of viral recovery by nasal swab and nucleic acid amplification less than 28 days after self-reported symptom resolution. Setting: A tertiary care center in a mid-size city utilizing a drive-through SAR-CoV-2 testing center. Participants: 86 previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals less than 28 days after self-reported resolution of symptoms evaluated as potential donors for COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Intervention: Participants underwent nasopharyngeal sampling and subsequent nucleic acid amplification for SARS-CoV-2 genes. Main Outcome: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal secretions detected by rtPCR. Results: 11\/86 (13%) previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 subjects were still positive at a median of 19 days (range 12-24 days) after symptom resolution. Older patients were more likely to be test-positive, and older positive patients had lower rtPCR CT values. Test-positive patients were not significantly different from test-negative patients with respect to days since symptom recovery. Conclusions and Resolution: These results underscore the necessity of testing COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors less than 28 days after symptom resolution and suggests that COVID-19 positive patients may need to remain in quarantine beyond the recommended two weeks following \"recovery.\"","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William R Hartman","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Aaron S Hess","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Joseph Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ping Yang","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chian-Shiu Chien","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aliaksandr A.

Despite limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs are being tested as medication or as prophylaxis to prevent infection. Using a stochastic model of early phase infection, we find that a critical efficacy above 87% is needed to block viral establishment. This can be improved by combination therapy. Below the critical efficacy, establishment of infection can sometimes be prevented, most effectively with drugs blocking viral entry into cells or enhancing viral clearance. Even when a viral infection cannot be prevented, antivirals delay the time to detectable viral loads. This delay flattens the within-host viral dynamic curve, possibly reducing transmission and symptom severity. Thus, antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Czuppon","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Florence D\u00e9barre","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gon\u00e7alves","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Paris, INSERM"},{"author_name":"Olivier Tenaillon","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Paris, INSERM"},{"author_name":"Alan S Perelson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Guedj","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Paris, INSERM"},{"author_name":"Fran\u00e7ois Blanquart","author_inst":"Coll\u00e8ge de France"},{"author_name":"Herve TISSOT DUPONT","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Philippe GAUTRET","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Andreas STEIN","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Philippe BROUQUI","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Philippe PAROLA","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe LAGIER","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Michel Drancourt","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Universite-IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094912","rel_title":"Facemasks prevent influenza-like illness: implications for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094912","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing a huge toll on individuals, families, communities and societies across the world. Currently, whether wearing facemasks in public should be a measure to prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains contraversial.1 This is largely because there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for coronavirus to directly support this. However, lessons may be taken from published RCTs examining influenza-like illness (ILI).2,3 Recent studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares similar transmission route with influenza virus,4 and the incidence of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with ILI is high.5 Therefore, we undertook this meta-analysis of RCTs examining the efficacy of wearing facemasks to prevent ILI in community settings, irrespective of confirmatory testing for the causative virus. We undertook a systematic literature search for RCTs related to facemasks and ILI between 1966 and April 2020 using PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane library. RCTs undertaken in community (not hospital) settings comparing wearing and not wearing facemasks for ILI were included. Incidence of ILI (e.g., fever, cough, headache, sore throat, aches or pains in muscles or joints) was estimated per group. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. We screened 899 related abstracts and eventually included 8 RCTs (Figure S1). Basic characteristics and quality of included RCTs are listed in Supplement. Participants wearing facemasks had a significantly lower risk of developing ILI than those not wearing facemasks (pooled RR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) and there was no heterogeneity (Figure 1). The decreased risk of ILI was more pronounced if everyone wore facemask irrespective of whether they were infected or not (RR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91), compared to those wearing facemasks when infected (RR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.58-1.56) or uninfected (RR=1.26, 95% CI: 0.69-2.31). This study shows that wearing facemasks, irrespective of infection status, is effective in preventing ILI spread in the community. This situation mirrors what is happening now in public settings where we do not know who has been infected and who has not. Although there are no RCTs of facemasks for SARS-CoV-2, as with other simple measures such as social distancing and handwashing, these data support the recommendation to wear facemasks in public to further reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and flatten the curve of this pandemic, especially when social distancing is impractical, such as shopping, or travelling with public transport for work that cannot be done from home.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Health Management Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China"},{"author_name":"Michael Doherty","author_inst":"Academic Rheumatology Department, Division of Rheumatology, Orthopaedics and Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Monica S.M.

Local factors that may be associated with variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission have not been well studied. Objective: To examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time. Design: Observational study Setting: 211 counties in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Participants: Residents within the counties (55% of the US population) Exposures: Social distancing as measured by percent change in visits to non-essential businesses, population density, lagged daily wet bulb temperatures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) which is the estimated number of cases generated by one case at a given time during the pandemic. Results: Median case incidence was 1185 cases and fatality rate was 43.7 deaths per 100,000 people for the top decile of 21 counties, nearly ten times the incidence and fatality rate in the lowest density quartile. Average Rt in the first two weeks was 5.7 (SD 2.5) in the top decile, compared to 3.1 (SD 1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to non-essential businesses was associated with a 57% decrease in Rt (95% confidence interval, 56% to 58%). Cumulative temperature effects over 4 to 10 days prior to case incidence were nonlinear; relative Rt decreased as temperatures warmed above 32F to 53F, which was the point of minimum Rt, then increased between 53F and 66F, at which point Rt began to decrease. At 55F, and with a 70% reduction in visits to non-essential business, 96% of counties were estimated to fall below a threshold Rt of 1.0, including 86% of counties among the top density decile and 98% of counties in the lowest density quartile. Conclusions and Relevance: Social distancing, lower population density, and temperate weather change were associated with a decreased SARS-Co-V-2 Rt in counties across the United States. These relationships can inform selective public policy planning in communities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Rubin","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Jing Huang","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Brian T Fisher","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gasparrini","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vicky Tam","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Lihai Song","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Jason Kaufman","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kate Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Arushi Jain","author_inst":"CHOP"},{"author_name":"Heather Griffis","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Koby Crammer","author_inst":"The Technion, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Michel Drancourt","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Universite-IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094789","rel_title":"Quantitative COVID-19 infectiousness estimate correlating with viral shedding and culturability suggests 68% pre-symptomatic transmissions","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094789","rel_abs":"A person clinically diagnosed with COVID 19 can infect others for several days before and after the onset of symptoms.

In this work, we attempt to provide a better quantitative estimate for the temporal infectiousness profile using serial interval data from a combined 1251 individuals reported in the literature. We show that the infectiousness profile which we calculate correlates well with the viral shedding kinetics from nasopharyngeal swabs (rho=0.97, p=0.00) and culturability (rho=0.83, p=0.01).

In Brazil by the end of April 2020, another 110 thousand cases and 5,000 deaths had been confirmed. The scarcity of laboratory resources and overload of the care network, added to the broad clinical spectrum of the disease, can make it difficult to capture all mortality from this disease through epidemiological surveillance based on individual notification of cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the excess of deaths in Brazilian capitals with the highest incidence of COVID-19, as a way of validating the method, we also evaluated a capital with low incidence. We assessed weekly mortality from all causes during the year 2020, up to the epidemiological week 17, compared with the previous year. The data were obtained through the National Civil Registry Information Center (CNIRC, acronym in Portuguese). We estimate the expected mortality and the 95% confidence interval by projecting the observed mortality in 2019 for the population of 2020. In the five capitals with the highest incidences it was possible to identify excess deaths in the pandemic period, the age group most affected were those over 60 years old, 31% of the excess deaths occurred in the population between 20 and 59 years old. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.94) between the excess of deaths in each city and the number of deaths confirmed by epidemiological surveillance. There was no excess of deaths in the capital with the lowest incidence, nor among the population under 20 years old. We estimate that epidemiological surveillance managed to capture only 52% of all mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the cities studied. Considering the simplicity of the method, its low cost and reliability for assessing the real burden of the disease, we believe that the assessment of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic should be widely used as a complementary tool to regular epidemiological surveillance and its use should be encouraged by WHO.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre Ricardo Ribas Freitas","author_inst":"Prefeitura Municipal de Campinas"},{"author_name":"N M Medeiros","author_inst":"Secretaria Municipal de Saude de Campinas"},{"author_name":"Livia Frutuoso","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude"},{"author_name":"Otto A Beckedorff","author_inst":"Faculdade Sao Leopoldo Mandic"},{"author_name":"Lucas M A Martin","author_inst":"Faculdade Sao Leopoldo Mandic"},{"author_name":"Marcela M M Coelho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Giovanna G S Freitas","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Marilia"},{"author_name":"Daniele R Q Lemos","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Christus"},{"author_name":"Luciano P G Cavalcanti","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Ceara"},{"author_name":"Arushi Jain","author_inst":"CHOP"},{"author_name":"Heather Griffis","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Koby Crammer","author_inst":"The Technion, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Michel Drancourt","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Universite-IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20093807","rel_title":"Unreported cases for Age Dependent COVID-19 Outbreak in Japan","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20093807","rel_abs":"We investigate the age structured data for the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan.

Prior studies indicate the protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health, mediated by vitamin D synthesis. In this study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (COVID-19 deaths). Methods: We carry out an observational study, applying a fixed-effect log-linear regression model to a panel dataset of 152 countries over a period of 108 days (n=6524). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables to test our hypothesis and isolate UVI effect from potential confounding factors such as underlying time trends, country-specific time-constant and time-varying factors such as weather. Findings: After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p < 0.01] as well as a 1.0 percentage points decline in the daily growth rates of CFR [p < 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms of the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (-11.88%) and CFR (-38.46%). Our results are consistent across different model specifications. Interpretation: We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths, indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention will be very attractive because it is cost-effective and widely available.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Kalippurayil Moozhipurath","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Lennart Kraft","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Bernd Skiera","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Otto A Beckedorff","author_inst":"Faculdade Sao Leopoldo Mandic"},{"author_name":"Lucas M A Martin","author_inst":"Faculdade Sao Leopoldo Mandic"},{"author_name":"Marcela M M Coelho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Giovanna G S Freitas","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Marilia"},{"author_name":"Daniele R Q Lemos","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Christus"},{"author_name":"Luciano P G Cavalcanti","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Ceara"},{"author_name":"Arushi Jain","author_inst":"CHOP"},{"author_name":"Heather Griffis","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Koby Crammer","author_inst":"The Technion, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Michel Drancourt","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Universite-IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094888","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis: An autopsy series with clinical and laboratory correlation.","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094888","rel_abs":"Background: A subset of COVID-19 patients exhibit clinical features of cytokine storm. However, clinicopathologic features diagnostic of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have not been reported. Pathologic studies to date have largely focused on the pulmonary finding of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). To this aim, we study the reticuloendothelial organs of four consecutive patients dying of COVID-19 and correlate with clinical and laboratory parameters to detect HLH. Methods: Autopsies restricted to chest and abdomen were performed on four patients who succumbed to COVID-19. Spleen, liver, and multiple pulmonary hilar\/mediastinal lymph nodes were sampled in all cases. Bone marrow was obtained by rib squeeze in a subset of cases. Routine H&E staining as well as immunohistochemical staining for CD163 was performed to detect hemophagocytosis. Clinical and laboratory results from pre-mortem blood samples were used to calculate H-scores. Findings: All four cases demonstrated DAD within the lungs. Three of the four cases had histologic evidence of hemophagocytosis within pulmonary hilar\/mediastinal lymph nodes. One case showed hemophagocytosis in the spleen but none showed hemophagocytosis in liver or bone marrow. Lymphophagocytosis was the predominant form of hemophagocytosis observed. One patient showed diagnostic features of HLH with an H-score of 217 while a second patient was likely HLH with a partial H-score of 145 due to missing triglyceride level. Both patients exhibited high fever and early onset rise in serum ferritin; however, neither bicytopenia, pancytopenia, nor hypofibrinogenemia were observed in either. The remaining two patients had H-scores of 131 and 96. Interpretation: This is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 associated HLH. Identification of HLH in a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 will inform clinical trials of therapeutic strategies.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrey Prilutskiy","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Kritselis","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Artem Shevtsov","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ilyas Yambayev","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Charitha Vadlamudi","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Qing Zhao","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yachana Kataria","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shayna Sarosiek","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam Lerner","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Mark Sloan","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Karen Quillen","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Burks","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Michel Drancourt","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Universite-IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20093708","rel_title":"Mental Health Status among the South Indian Pharmacy Students during Covid-19 Pandemic Quarantine Period: A Cross-Sectional Study","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20093708","rel_abs":"Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak created a major panic among all the citizens of the country owing to its severity, contagiousness within the community, lack of specific treatment and possibility of re-infection. All these factors along with the uncertain behaviour of the virus lead to state of fear and concern all throught out the nation. The current study represents the mental health survey conducted on the students of South India after the completion of one month quarantine period of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology: The present study is a cross-sectional, web-based online survey which consists of 21-item DASS questionnaire. This was used to assess the emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. Using Google Forms, the questionnaire was randomly distributed among the pharmacy students of selected colleges. Mean with standard deviation was calculated for continuous variables and the number with percentage was calculated for categorical variables. Results: A total of 500 participants responded to the questionnaire. More than half of the responses were received from females (65%). On assessment it was found that, 26 % of respondents reported severe to extremely severe depressive symptoms; 31.5 % of respondents reported severe to extremely severe anxiety symptoms, and 19 % reported severe to extremely severe stress levels. Conclusion: In India during the outbreak of COVID-19, an alarming number of students were found to have an impact on mental health due to the outbreak and were observed to have higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The study findings shows the need of conducting more such studies and can be used to prepare appropriate psychological interventions to improve mental health among the young public during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vidyadhara Suryadevara","author_inst":"Chebrolu Hanumaiah Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chakravarthy Adusumalli","author_inst":"Chebrolu Hanumaiah Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Pramod Kumar Adusumilli","author_inst":"Chebrolu Hanumaiah Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sri Harsha Chalasani","author_inst":"JSS College of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Rahul Radhakrishnan","author_inst":"KLE College of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Qing Zhao","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yachana Kataria","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shayna Sarosiek","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam Lerner","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Mark Sloan","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Karen Quillen","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Burks","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Michel Drancourt","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Universite-IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20090340","rel_title":"The German COVID-19 Survey on Mental Health: Primary Results","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20090340","rel_abs":"Abstract First cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan, China in early December 2019. Preliminary data from China indicated a substantial impact on mental health by the pandemic and its associated lockdown measures. Such measures are unprecedented for the majority of people and may affect their lives tremendously. The current survey was developed to assess mental health in response to the lockdown in Germany. Methods We conducted a web-based self-report survey including various aspects of mental health (e.g. PHQ-D, PHQ-4, WHO-5 and comparative questions on a 5-point Likert scale concerning sleep, irritability & interpersonal violence). First wave data were taken during the height of lockdown measures in Germany from 1 April to 15 April 2020. Results A total of 3,545 volunteers took part in this cross-sectional survey. Mean age was 40.36 years (SD = 11.70; 83.1% female, 15.2% male). Acute or chronic disease was reported by 36.7% (physical) and 24.7% (mental) of subjects. Participants scored mild severity distress in the PHQ stress module. Depression and anxiety as assessed by PHQ-4 was significantly higher than in reference samples. The mean well-being score (WHO-5) was 50.7, thus pointing towards possible signs of depression. Furthermore, we found significant gender differences for anxiety and depression with women showing higher levels. 45.3% of participants reported worsened sleep, increased levels of irritation, anger and aggression compared to pre-pandemic times. Most importantly, 5% of all participants reported experiencing interpersonal violence (IPV). Discussion This is one of the first and largest surveys on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in a European society reflecting a relatively well educated and financially secure sample. Yet, there is evidence for a substantial mental burden with increased levels of stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance and irritability. Most importantly and also most concerning is the finding of a one-month prevalence of 5% IPV. We think it is of vital importance to continuously monitor the mental health of the general public during this pandemic and its aftermath and to carefully screen for IPV and its risk factors such as stress, sleep problems and anger.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefanie Jung","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jonas Kneer","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Tillmann Krueger","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Sri Harsha Chalasani","author_inst":"JSS College of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Rahul Radhakrishnan","author_inst":"KLE College of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Qing Zhao","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yachana Kataria","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shayna Sarosiek","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam Lerner","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Mark Sloan","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Karen Quillen","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Burks","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Michel Drancourt","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Universite-IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"}]}
