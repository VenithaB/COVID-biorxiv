Worldwide, more than 130 countries have imposed severe restrictions, which form part of a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)s. We aimed to quantify the country-specific effects of these NPIs and compare them using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) stringency index, p, as a measure of NPI stringency. Methods We developed a dual latent\/observable Susceptible Infected Recovered Deaths (SIRD) model and applied it on each of 22 countries and 25 states in the US using publicly available data. The observable model parameters were extracted using kernel functions. The regression of the transmission rate, {beta}, as a function of p in each locale was modeled through the intervention leverage, s, an initial transmission rate, {beta}0 and a typical adjustment time, br-1. Results The world average for the intervention leverage, s=0.01 (95% CI 0.0102 - 0.0112) had an ensemble standard deviation of 0.0017 (95% C.I. 0.0014 - 0.0021), strongly indicating a universal behavior. Discussion Our study indicates that removing NPIs too swiftly will result in the resurgence of the spread within one to two months, in alignment with the current WHO recommendations. Moreover, we have quantified and are able to predict the effect of various combinations of NPIs. There is a minimum NPI level, below which leads to resurgence of the outbreak (in the absence of pharmaceutical and clinical advances). For the epidemic to remain sub-critical, the rate with which the intervention leverage s increases should outpace that of the relaxation of NPIs.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacques Naude","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Bruce Mellado","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Joshua Choma","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Fabio Correa","author_inst":"Rhodes University"},{"author_name":"Salah Dahbi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Barry Dwolatzky","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Leslie Dwolatzky","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Hayasi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Lieberman","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Caroline Maslo","author_inst":"Netcare"},{"author_name":"Kgomotso Monnakgotla","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Ruan","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Finn Stevenson","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086199","rel_title":"A non-parametric mathematical model to investigate the dynamic of a pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086199","rel_abs":"Populations are diverse in size, capacity response, and measures to contain a pandemic such covid19.

We here investigated the geographical character of the infection and correlate it with several annual satellite and ground indexes of air quality in: China, the United States, Italy, Iran, France, Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Controlling for population size, we found more viral infections in those areas afflicted by high PM 2.5 and Nitrogen Dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air quality. In Italy, the correspondence between the Po valley pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infections and induced mortality was the starkest, originating right in the most polluted European area.

In the present study, raw and treated samples from three wastewater treatment plants, and two river samples characterized the Milano Metropolitan Area, Italy, were surveyed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity to real time PCR and infectiveness. Moreover, whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of isolated strains was performed. Raw wastewater samples resulted positive to PCR amplification, while treated water samples were always negative (four and two samples, respectively, sampled in two dates). Moreover, the rate of positivity in raw wastewater samples decreased after eight days, in congruence with the epidemiological trend estimated for the interested provinces. Virus infectiveness was always not significant, indicating the effectiveness of wastewater treatments, or the natural decay of viral vitality, which implied the absence of significant risk of infection from wastewaters. Samples from receiving rivers (two sites, sampled in the same dates as wastewaters) showed in some cases a positivity to PCR amplification, probably due to non-treated discharges, or the combined sewage overflows. Nevertheless, also for rivers vitality was negligible, indicating the absence of sanitary risks. Phylogenetic analysis of genome indicated that the isolated virus belongs to the most spread strain present in Europe and similar to another strain found in Lombardy.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara Giordana Rimoldi","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Stefani","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Gigantiello","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Polesello","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Comandatore","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

The diversity, distribution, and host associations of bat CoVs were investigated to assess their potential for zoonotic transmission. Phylogenetic, network, and principal coordinate analysis confirmed the classification of betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) into five groups (2A to 2E) and a potentially novel group, with further division of 2D into five subgroups. The genetic co-clustering of BetaCoVs among closely related bats reflects host taxon-specificity with each bat family as the host for a specific BetaCoV group, potentially a natural barrier against random transmission. The divergent pathway of BetaCoV and host evolution suggests that the viruses were introduced just prior to bat dispersal and speciation. As such, deviant patterns were observed such as for 2D-IV, wherein cross-taxon transmission due to overlap in bat habitats and geographic range among genetically divergent African bat hosts could have played a strong role on their shared CoV lineages. In fact, a few bat taxa especially the subfamily Pteropodinae were shown to host diverse groups of BetaCoVs. Therefore, ecological imbalances that disturb bat distribution may lead to loss of host specificity through cross-taxon transmission and multi-CoV infection. Hence, initiatives that minimize the destruction of wildlife habitats and limit wildlife-livestock-human interfaces are encouraged to help maintain the natural state of bat BetaCoVs in the wild.\n\nImportanceBat Betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) pose a significant threat to global public health and have been implicated in several epidemics such as the recent pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Here, we show that bat BetaCoVs are predominantly host-specific, which could be a natural barrier against infection of other host types. However, a strong overlap in bat habitat and geographic range may facilitate viral transmission to unrelated hosts, and a few bat families have already been shown to host multi-CoV variants. We predict that continued disturbances on the ecological balance may eventually lead to loss of host specificity. When combined with enhanced wildlife-livestock-human interfaces, spillover to humans may be further facilitated. We should therefore start to define the ecological mechanisms surrounding zoonotic events. Global surveillance should be expanded and strengthened to assess the complete picture of bat coronavirus diversity and distribution and their potential to cause spillover infections.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lyre Espada Murao","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Michael G Bacus","author_inst":"Philippine Genome Center Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Stephen Adrian H Dayap","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Nikki Vanesa T Tampon","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Marielle M Udarbe","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Roberto P Puentespina Jr.","author_inst":"Animal Solutions Veterinary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sharon Yvette Angelina M Villanueva","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Manila"},{"author_name":"Aleyla E de Cadiz","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Marion John Michael M Achondo","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Francesca Romeri","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Pagani","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Moja","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franco Salerno","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"confirmatory results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.077826","rel_title":"Alpha 1 Antitrypsin is an Inhibitor of the SARS-CoV2-Priming Protease TMPRSS2","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.077826","rel_abs":"The transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 is indispensable for S protein priming of the MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 coronaviruses, a process that is necessary for entry of the virus into host cells.

It is unclear why some SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals remain asymptomatic, while others develop severe symptoms. Baseline pulmonary levels of anti-viral leukocytes, already residing in the lung prior to infection, may orchestrate an effective early immune response and prevent severe symptoms. Using \"in silico flow cytometry\", we deconvoluted the levels of all seven types of anti-viral leukocytes in 1,927 human lung tissues. Baseline levels of CD8+ T cells, resting NK cells and activated NK cells, as well as cytokines that recruit these, are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. We observe this in univariate analyses, in multivariate analyses, and in two independent datasets. Relevantly, ACE2 mRNA and protein levels very strongly correlate in human cells and tissues. Above findings also largely apply to the SARS-CoV-2 entry protease TMPRSS2. Both SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells and COVID-19 lung tissues show upregulation of CD8+ T cell- and NK cell-recruiting cytokines. Moreover, tissue-resident CD8+ T cells and inflammatory NK cells are significantly more abundant in bronchoalveolar lavages from mildly affected COVID-19 patients, compared to severe cases. This suggests that these lymphocytes are important for preventing severe symptoms. Elevated ACE2 expression increases sensitivity to coronavirus infection. Thus, our results suggest that some individuals may be exceedingly susceptible to develop severe COVID-19 due to concomitant high pre-existing ACE2 and TMPRSS expression and low baseline cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in the lung.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pascal H.

These observations open up an obvious question about the rate and direction of mutational pressure for further vaccine and therapeutics designing. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of nonsynonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerated sites towards uracil residues is seen in ORF1 of all the studied coronaviruses. A more substantial mutational U pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b owing to the translation of ORF1ab via programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring in the RNA-plus strand, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses. The knowledge generated on the direction of mutational pressure during translation of viral RNA-plus strands has implications for vaccine and nucleoside analogue development for treating covid-19 and other coronavirus infections.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vladislav Victorovich Khrustalev","author_inst":"Belarusian State Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rajanish Giri","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Aleksandrovna Khrustaleva","author_inst":"Institute of Physiology of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus"},{"author_name":"Shivani Krishna Kapuganti","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Aleksander Nicolaevich Stojarov","author_inst":"Belarusian State Medical University"},{"author_name":"Victor Vitoldovich Poboinev","author_inst":"Belarusian State Medical University"},{"author_name":"Eileen M Burd","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Charles E Hill","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Colleen S Kraft","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Francesca Romeri","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Pagani","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Moja","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franco Salerno","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.078956","rel_title":"Selectomic and Evolvability Analyses of the Highly Pathogenic Betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.078956","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is widespread in several countries around the world following its late-2019 emergence in the human population. Rapid development of molecular diagnostic tests and subunit vaccines have been prioritized, and as such evaluating the SARS-CoV-2 genomic plasticity and evolutionary dynamics is an urgent need. We determined the SARS-CoV-2 selectome by calculating rates of pervasive and episodic diversifying selection for every amino acid coding position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. To provide context for evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic betacoronavirus following a zoonotic spillover into human hosts, we also determined the selectomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and performed evolvability calculations for SARS-CoV-2 based on SARS-CoV. These analyses identify the amino acid sites within each coding sequence that have been subjected to pervasive diversifying selection or episodic diversifying selection, and report significantly evolvable sites in the ORF1a polyprotein, the spike protein, and the membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2. These findings provide a comprehensive view of zoonotic, highly pathogenic betacoronavirus evolutionary dynamics that can be directly applied to diagnostic assay and vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meghan May","author_inst":"University of New England"},{"author_name":"Bahman Rostama","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences University of New England"},{"author_name":"Ryan F.

Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 3 million and has killed about 230,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 originated in China and, within three months, has evolved to an additional 10 subtypes. One particular subtype with a non-silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position of the Spike protein (D614G) rapidly outcompeted other pre-existing subtypes, including the ancestral. We assessed that D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease (Elastase) cleavage site near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We also identified that a single nucleotide deletion (delC) at a known variant site (rs35074065) in a cis-eQTL of TMPRSS2, is extremely rare in East Asians but is common in Europeans and North Americans. The delC allele facilitates entry of the 614G subtype into host cells, thus accelerating the spread of 614G subtype in Europe and North America where the delC allele is common. The delC allele at the cis-eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2 leads to overexpression of both TMPRSS2 and a nearby gene MX1. The cis-eQTL site, rs35074065 overlaps with a transcription factor binding site of an activator (IRF1) and a repressor (IRF2). IRF1 activator can bind to variant delC allele, but IRF2 repressor fails to bind. Thus, in an individual carrying the delC allele, there is only activation, but no repression. On viral entry, IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1 leads to neutrophil infiltration and processing of 614G mutated Spike protein by neutrophil Elastase. The simultaneous processing of 614G spike protein by TMPRSS2 and Elastase serine proteases facilitates the entry of the 614G subtype into host cells. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chandrika Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Chitrarpita Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Arnab Ghosh","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Animesh K Singh","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Souvik Mukherjee","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Partha P Majumder","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Analabha Basu","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Nidhan K Biswas","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Colleen S Kraft","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Francesca Romeri","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Pagani","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Moja","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franco Salerno","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.077842","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Receptor Binding Domain is Subject to Negative Selection with Predicted Positive Selection Mutations","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.077842","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host cell surface receptor ACE2 is responsible for mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Mutations on most of these residues are likely to be deleterious, leading to less infectious virus strains that may suffer from negative selection. Meanwhile, several residues with mostly advantageous mutations have been predicted. It is more probable that mutations on these residues increase the transmission ability of the virus by enhancing spike-hACE2 interaction. So far, only a limited number of mutations has been reported in this region. However, the list of hot spot residues with predicted downstream effects from this study can still serve as a tracking list for SARS-CoV-2 evolution studies.

Great efforts have been spent to control the pandemic that has become a significant burden on the health systems in a short time. Since the emergence of the crisis, a great number of researchers started to use the AI tools to identify drugs, diagnosing using CT scan images, scanning body temperature, and classifying the severity of the disease. The emergence of variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a challenging problem with expected serious consequences on the management of the disease. Here, we introduce COVIDier, a deep learning-based software that is enabled to classify the different genomes of Alpha coronavirus, Beta coronavirus, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bronchitis-CoV. COVIDier was trained on 1925 genomes, belonging to the three families of SARS retrieved from NCBI Database to propose a new method to train deep learning model trained on genome data using Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier), a deep learning algorithm, that could blindly predict the virus family name from the genome of by predicting the statistically similar genome from training data to the given genome.

Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point. Methods Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC). Results In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were 3 deaths (17.8+\/-10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7\/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17\/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and 1 serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p<0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p= 0.04 and p=0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients. Conclusion Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luca Quartuccio","author_inst":"University of Udine"},{"author_name":"Arianna Sonaglia","author_inst":"University of Udine"},{"author_name":"Dennis McGonagle","author_inst":"National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Leeds Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Martina Fabris","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, ASUFC, DAME, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maddalena Peghin","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Pecori","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Amato De Monte","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tiziana Bove","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, ASUFC, Udine, Italy; Anesthesia and Intensive Care Clinic, University of Udine, Udine, Italy."},{"author_name":"Francesco Curcio","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, ASUFC, DAME, University of Udine, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Flavio Bassi","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Salvatore De Vita","author_inst":"Clinic of Rheumatology, ASUFC, DAME, University of Udine, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tascini","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franco Salerno","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20079376","rel_title":"Vitamin D deficiency as risk factor for severe COVID-19: a convergence of two pandemics","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20079376","rel_abs":"Context.

Objective. To investigate the level of vitamin D deficiency in West Flanders, Belgium and its correlation to severity of COVID-19 as staged by CT Design. Retrospective observational study Setting. Central network hospital Participants. 186 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients hospitalized from March 1, 2020 to April 7, 2020 Main outcome measure. Analysis of 25(OH)D in COVID-19 patients versus season\/age\/sex-matched diseased controls Results. The rate of vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D<20 ng\/mL) in West Flanders varies with age, sex and season but is overall very high (39.9%) based on analysis of 16274 control samples. We measured 25(OH)D levels in 186 COVID-19 patients (109 males (median age 68 years, IQR 53-79) and 77 females (median age 71 years, IQR 65-74)) and 2717 age\/season-matched controls (999 males (median age 69 years, IQR 53-81) and 1718 females (median age 68 years, IQR 43-83)). COVID-19 patients showed lower median 25(OH)D (18.6 ng\/mL, IQR 12.6-25.3, versus 21.5 ng\/mL, IQR 13.9-30.8; P=0.0016) and higher vitamin D deficiency rates (58.6% versus 45.2%, P=0.0005). Surprisingly, this difference was restricted to male COVID-19 patients who had markedly higher deficiency rates than male controls (67.0% versus 49.2%, P=0.0006) that increased with advancing radiological stage and were not confounded vitamin D-impacted comorbidities. Conclusions: vitamin D deficiency is a prevalent risk factor for severe COVID-19. Vitamin D supplementation might be an inexpensive and safe mitigation for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dieter De Smet","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kristof De Smet","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pauline Herroelen","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stefaan Gryspeerdt","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Geert Antoine Martens","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital and Vrije Universiteit Brussel"},{"author_name":"Davide Pecori","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Amato De Monte","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tiziana Bove","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, ASUFC, Udine, Italy; Anesthesia and Intensive Care Clinic, University of Udine, Udine, Italy."},{"author_name":"Francesco Curcio","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, ASUFC, DAME, University of Udine, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Flavio Bassi","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Salvatore De Vita","author_inst":"Clinic of Rheumatology, ASUFC, DAME, University of Udine, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tascini","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franco Salerno","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20074609","rel_title":"Early Short Course Corticosteroids in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20074609","rel_abs":"Background: There is no proven antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy for COVID-19. The disease progression associated with the pro-inflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a single pre-test, single post-test quasi-experiment in a multi-center health system in Michigan from March 12 to March 27, 2020. Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on March 20, 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg\/kg\/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days. Outcomes of pre- and post-corticosteroid groups were evaluated. A composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to ICU, new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality was the primary outcome measure. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. Results: We analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in pre-and post-corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in post-corticosteroid group compared to pre-corticosteroid group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005). This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint. Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was observed in the post-corticosteroid group (8 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent reduction in the composite endpoint at 14-days controlling for other factors (aOR: 0.45; 95% CI [0.25-0.81]). Conclusion: An early short course of methylprednisolone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 reduced escalation of care and improved clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raef Fadel","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Austin Morrison","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Amit Vahia","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Zachary R Smith","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Zohra Chaudhry","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Pallavi Bhargava","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Joseph Miller","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Rachel Kenney","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"George Alangaden","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Mayur S Ramesh","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"- Henry Ford COVID-19 Management Task Force","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Carlo Tascini","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franco Salerno","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20082750","rel_title":"Transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 outside of Daegu-Gyeongsangbuk provincial region in South Korea","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20082750","rel_abs":"We analyzed transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 in South Korea.

The daily trend in reported cases has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great majority of the cases reported in Brazil followed by Peru as of April 15th, 2020. Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6th, 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country. We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru. We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020. We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place. Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5). Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government. While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cesar V.

We report thromboelastography (TEG) testing on a cohort of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of admission to the intensive care unit. Methods: TEG testing was performed using the TEG 6s analyzer near or at the time of ICU admission. We also report the results of other coagulation or inflammatory related indices such as platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin. All laboratory testing was performed at the discretion of the attending physician in the course of normal patient care and retrospectively reviewed. Results: We found that maximum clot strength was consistently elevated in COVID-19 patients while normal in all patients found to be negative. We did not encounter significant prolongations of coagulation assays outside of those expectedly prolonged by heparin therapy nor was meeting the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation encountered. Conclusions: We postulate that elevated maximum clot strength by TEG testing is predictive of COVID-19 status as within our cohort this perfectly predicted patients COVID-19 status despite a high level of suspicion in negative patients with normal TEG results. While these results require a larger cohort for confirmation, we feel that TEG testing could improve confidence in negative COVID-19 testing results in suspected patients possibly allowing for earlier de-escalation of infectious precautions and personal protective equipment utilization.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaun D Lawicki","author_inst":"LSUHSC"},{"author_name":"Katherine V Wang","author_inst":"LSUHSC"},{"author_name":"Bing Han","author_inst":"LSUHSC"},{"author_name":"Gordon L Love","author_inst":"LSUHSC"},{"author_name":"Mary F.

Early detection of affected patients within the huge population of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort but often hindered by limited testing resources. We aimed to identify predictive risk profiles for a positive PCR result in primary care. Methods: Multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive characteristics over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. We evaluated age, sex, reason for testing, risk factors, symptoms, and expected PCR result for their impact on the test result. Results: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab testing and were included in this analysis. A fraction of 10.7% (n=40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51-13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11-0.97). Patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.72-15.51). This correlation was also present when they themselves were still asymptomatic (OR: 12.55; 95% CI: 3.97-39.67). Conclusion: The reported contact to an infected person is the most important factor for a positive PCR result, independent of any symptoms of illness in the tested patient. Those persons with contact to an infected person should always get a PCR test. If no contact is reported and testing material is scarce, anosmia should increase the likelihood of performing a test, while a sore throat should decrease it.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johannes Just","author_inst":"Witten\/Herdecke University, Institute of General Practice and Interprofessional Care"},{"author_name":"Marie-Therese Puth","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology (IMBIE), University Hospital Bonn"},{"author_name":"Felix Regenold","author_inst":"Witten\/Herdecke University, Institute of General Practice and Interprofessional Care"},{"author_name":"Klaus Weckbecker","author_inst":"Witten\/Herdecke University, Institute of General Practice and Interprofessional Care"},{"author_name":"Markus Bleckwenn","author_inst":"Leipzig University, Department of General Practice"},{"author_name":"Andree Valle","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Prevencion y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Rojas-Mezarina","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Cesar Cabezas","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Manuel Loayza","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Prevencion y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru."},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Peru COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tascini","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franco Salerno","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20082990","rel_title":"A simple model to show the relative risk of viral aerosol infection and the benefit of  wearing masks in different settings with implications for Covid-19 .","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20082990","rel_abs":"Background. Widespread use of masks in the general population is being used in many countries for control of Covid-19. There has been reluctance on the part of the WHO and some governments to recommend this. Methodology. A basic model has been constructed to show the relative risk of aerosol from normal breathing in various situations together with the relative benefit from use of different masks. Results. The benefit from mask use between individuals is multiplicative not additive and although social distancing at 2 meters appears beneficial with regards to aerosol infectivity, in confined areas this is time limited requiring additional measures such as masks. The model shows the relative benefit of masks when social distancing is not possible at all times, or when in confined areas which can also be aided by efficient ventilation. Where a person is in one place for a prolonged period there is more risk requiring protection. Conclusions. Masks should be used in the above situations especially at an early stage of an outbreak. Public health planning requires stockpiling of masks and encouraging everyone to have suitable masks in their household when supplies are normalised. In the absence of widely available good quality masks the use of a cloth mask will be better than no protection at all.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerald D Barr","author_inst":"Independent Health Research"},{"author_name":"Marie-Therese Puth","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology (IMBIE), University Hospital Bonn"},{"author_name":"Felix Regenold","author_inst":"Witten\/Herdecke University, Institute of General Practice and Interprofessional Care"},{"author_name":"Klaus Weckbecker","author_inst":"Witten\/Herdecke University, Institute of General Practice and Interprofessional Care"},{"author_name":"Markus Bleckwenn","author_inst":"Leipzig University, Department of General Practice"},{"author_name":"Andree Valle","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Prevencion y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Rojas-Mezarina","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Cesar Cabezas","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Manuel Loayza","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Prevencion y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru."},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Peru COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tascini","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franco Salerno","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20079657","rel_title":"Geospatial Correlation Between COVID-19 Health Misinformation on Social Media and Poisoning with Household Cleaners","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20079657","rel_abs":"Prolific social media activity has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic.

In England, 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) is diagnosed via urgent symptomatic referral from primary care, the \"2-week-wait\" (2WW) pathway. Access to routine endoscopy is likely to be a critical bottleneck causing delays in CRC management due to chronic limitation in capacity, acute competition for physician time, and safety concerns. Methods: We used age-specific, stage-specific 10 year CRC survival for England 2007-2017 and 2WW CRC cases volumes. We used per-day hazard ratios of CRC survival generated from observational studies of CRC diagnosis-to-treatment interval to model the effect of different durations of per-patient delay. We utilised data from a large London observational study of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in symptomatic patients to model FIT-triage to mitigate delay to colonoscopy. Findings: Modest delays result in significant reduction in survival from CRC with a 4-month delay resulting across age groups in [&ge;]20% reduction in survival in Stage 3 disease and in total over a year, 1,419 attributable deaths across the 11,266 CRC patients diagnosed via the 2WW pathway. FIT triage of >10 ug Hb\/g would salvage 1,292\/1,419 of the attributable deaths and reduce colonoscopy requirements by >80%. Diagnostic colonoscopy offers net survival in all age groups, providing nosocomial COVID-19 infection rates are kept low (<2.5%). Interpretation To avoid significant numbers of avoidable deaths from CRC, normal diagnostic and surgical throughput must be maintained. An accrued backlog of cases will present to primary care following release of lockdown, supranormal endoscopy capacity will be required to manage this without undue delays. FIT-triage of symptomatic cases provides a rational approach by which to avoid patient delay and mitigate pressure on capacity in endoscopy. This would also reduce exposure to nosocomial COVID-19 infection, relevant in particular to older patient groups.

Recently, the advent of deep learning in medical diagnosis has been well proven. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used to detect the COVID-19 infection imaging features in a chest CT scan. We introduce ai-corona, a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for COVID-19 infection diagnosis using the chest CT scans. Method: Our dataset comprises 2121 cases of axial spiral chest CT scans in three classes; COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal, and normal, from which 1764 cases were used for training and 357 cases for validation. The training set was annotated using the reports of two experienced radiologists. The COVID-19 abnormal class validation set was annotated using the general consensus of a collective of criteria that indicate COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the validation sets for the non COVID-19 abnormal and the normal classes were annotated by a different experienced radiologist. ai-corona constitutes a CNN-based feature extractor conjoined with an average pooling and a fully-connected layer to classify a given chest CT scan into the three aforementioned classes. Results: We compare the diagnosis performance of ai-corona, radiologists, and model-assisted radiologists for six combinations of distinguishing between the three mentioned classes, including COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, COVID-19 abnormal vs. normal, COVID-19 abnormal vs. non COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, normal vs. others, and normal vs. abnormal. ai-corona achieves an AUC score of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.984, 0.994), 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995, 0.999), 0.986 (95% CI: 0.981, 0.991), 0.959 (95% CI: 0.944, 0.974), 0.978 (95% CI: 0.968, 0.988), and 0.961 (95% CI: 0.951, 0.971) in each combination, respectively. By employing Bayesian statistics to calculate the accuracies at a 95% confidence interval, ai-corona surpasses the radiologists in distinguishing between the COVID-19 abnormal class and the other two classes (especially the non COVID-19 abnormal class). Our results show that radiologists diagnostic performance improves when incorporating ai-coronas prediction. In addition, we also show that RT-PCRs diagnosis has a much lower sensitivity compared to all the other methods. Conclusion: ai-corona is a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for fast and accurate COVID19 diagnosis in chest CT scans. Our results ascertain that our framework, as a reliable detection tool, also improves experts diagnosis performance and helps especially in diagnosing non-typical COVID-19 cases or non COVID-19 abnormal cases that manifest COVID-19 imaging features in chest CT scan.

In this study we assessed the death rate associated to COVID-19 in Brazil and the United States of America (USA) to estimate the probability of Brazil becoming the next pandemic epicenter. We equated data between Brazil and USA obtained through the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Epidemic curves from Brazil and USA were associated and regression analysis was undertaken to predict the Brazilian death rate regarding COVID-19 in June. In view of data from April 9th 2020, death rates in Brazil follow a similar exponential increase to USA (r=0.999; p<0.001), estimating 64,310 deaths by June 9th 2020. In brief, our results demonstrated that Brazil follows an analogous progression of COVID-19 deaths cases when compared to USA, signifying that Brazil could be the next global epicenter of COVID-19. We highlight public strategies to decrease the COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro de Lemos Menezes","author_inst":"University of Health Sciences of Alagoas, AL, Brazil"},{"author_name":"David M.

In absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine is critical. Early detection and differential diagnosis of respiratory infections increases the chances for successful control of COVID-19 disease. The nucleic acid RT-PCR test is regarded as the current standard for molecular diagnosis with high sensitivity. However, the highest specificity confirmation target ORF1ab gene is considered to be less sensitive than other targets in clinical application. In addition, a large amount of recent evidence indicates that the initial missed diagnosis of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 and discharged patients with \"re-examination positive\" may be due to low viral load, and the ability of rapid mutation of coronavirus also increases the rate of false negative results. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of different nucleic acid detection kits so as to make recommendations for the selection of validation kit, and amplify the suspicious result to be reportable positive by means of simple continuous amplification, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of the current epidemic and the discharge criteria of low viral load patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"yunying zhou","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Fengyan Pei","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"inan Infectious Disease Hospital, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Jinan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Huanjie Li","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Mingyu Ji","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Weihua Yang","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Qingxi Wang","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Qianqian Zhao","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Meisam Hoseinyazdi","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jafar Roshandel","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Negar Bandegani","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Abbas Danesh","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Mehrdad Bakhshayesh Karam","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Atefeh Abedini","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Mark Lawler","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"David C.
