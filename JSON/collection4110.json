Study design: Longitudinal ecological study. Setting: 460 Care home units using the same software package to collect data on residents, from 46 local authority areas in England. Participants: 6,464 care home residents with at least one NEWS recording. Exposure measure: 29,656 anonymised person-level NEWS from 29\/12\/2019 to 20\/05\/2020 with component physiological measures: systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. Baseline values for each measure calculated using 80th and 20th centile scores before March 2020. Outcome measure: Time series comparison with Office for National Statistics (ONS) weekly reported registered deaths of care home residents where COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death, and all other deaths (excluding COVID-19) up to 10\/05\/2020. Results: Deaths due to COVID-19 were registered from 23\/03\/2020 in the study geographical areas. Between 23\/03\/2020 and 10\/05\/2020, there were 5,753 deaths (1,532 involving COVID-19 and 4,221 other causes). The proportion of above-baseline NEWS increased from 16\/03\/2020 and closely followed the rise and fall in COVID-19 deaths over the study period. The proportion of above-baseline oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature measurements also increased approximately two weeks before peaks in care home deaths in corresponding geographical areas. Conclusions: NEWS may make a useful contribution to disease surveillance in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature could be prioritised as they appear to signal rise in mortality almost as well as total NEWS. This study reinforces the need to collate data from care homes, to monitor and protect residents' health. Further work using individual level outcome data is needed to evaluate the role of NEWS in the early detection of resident illness.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Stow","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Robert O Barker","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Fiona E Matthews","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Barbara Hanratty","author_inst":"Newcastle University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20127498","rel_title":"Reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectious spreading patterns by removing S and R compartments from SIR model equation","rel_date":"2020-06-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20127498","rel_abs":"This research points to the asymptotic instability of SIR model and its variants to predict the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 infection spreading patterns over the population and time aspects.

While S and R are not homologous data of analysis, thus with improper topological metrics used in many researches, these terms leads to the asymptotic feature of I term as the most stable point of analysis to achieve proper predictive methods. Having in its basis of formulation the policies adopted by countries, I therefore presents a stable fixed point orientation in order to be used as a predictive analysis of nearby future patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection. New metrics using a Weinbull approach for I are presented and fixed point orientation (sensitivity of the method) are demonstrated empirically by worldwide statistical data.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charles Roberto Telles","author_inst":"Secretary of State for Education of Paran"},{"author_name":"Robert O Barker","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Fiona E Matthews","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Barbara Hanratty","author_inst":"Newcastle University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.20131680","rel_title":"Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 Risk Classification in Kidney Disease: Can Technology Unmask an Unseen Disease?","rel_date":"2020-06-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.20131680","rel_abs":"Background: We developed two unique machine learning (ML) models that predict risk of: 1) a major COVID-19 outbreak in the service county of a local HD population within following week, and 2) a hemodialysis (HD) patient having an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection that is identified after following 3 or more days. Methods: We used county-level data from United States population (March 2020) and HD patient data from a network of clinics (February-May 2020) to develop two ML models. First was a county-level model that used data from general and HD populations (21 variables); outcome of a COVID-19 outbreak in a dialysis service area was defined as a clinic being located in one of the national counties with the highest growth in COVID-19 positive cases (number and people per million (ppm)) in general population during 22-28 Mar 2020. Second was a patient-level model that used HD patient data (82 variables) to predict an individual having an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection that is identified in subsequent [&ge;]3 days. Results: Among 1682 counties with dialysis clinics, 82 (4.9%) had a COVID-19 outbreak during 22-28 Mar 2020. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the county-level model was 0.86 in testing dataset. Top predictor of a county experiencing an outbreak was the COVID-19 positive ppm in the general population in the prior week. In a select group (n=11,664) used to build the patient-level model, 28% of patients had COVID-19; prevalence was by design 10% in the testing dataset. AUROC for the patient-level model was 0.71 in the testing dataset. Top predictor of an HD patient having a SARS-CoV-2 infection was mean pre-HD body temperature in the prior week. Conclusions: Developed ML models appear suitable for predicting counties at risk of a COVID-19 outbreak and HD patients at risk of having an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caitlin Monaghan","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"John W Larkin","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Car, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Sheetal Chaudhuri","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Hao Han","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Yue Jiao","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Kristine Marie Bermudez","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Eric D Weinhandl","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Ines A Dahne-Steuber","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Belmonte","author_inst":"Fresenius Kidney Care"},{"author_name":"Luca Neri","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, EMEA Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Peter Kotanko","author_inst":"Renal Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jeroen P Kooman","author_inst":"Maastricht University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Hymes","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Robert J Kossmann","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Len A Usvyat","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Franklin W Maddux","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co.

Few studies have examined how a population's food choices change during a country-wide stress-inducing event such as the beginning of the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in the United States. Food data from a digital behavior change weight loss program, which includes an interface for logging meals, were analyzed to assess self-reported food choices from March 5-March 11 (\"pre-COVID\") and during the first week of the COVID-19 lockdown (March 12-March 18; \"during-COVID\"). The final sample consisted of 381,564 participants: 318,076 (83.4%) females, the majority who were aged 45-65 years (45.2%). Results indicate that self-reported servings of fresh fruit and vegetable intake decreased from pre- to during-COVID, while intake of red meat and starchy vegetables increased. More men than women increased their intake of red meat and processed meat. There was less overall change in fruit and vegetable consumption in participants aged 66 and older, compared to younger participants (aged 18-35). The percentage of older participants who reported lean meat and starchy vegetable intake increased, but these groups had a negligible change in younger subjects. More subjects aged 18-35 years reduced their intake of caffeine, desserts, lean meat and salads compared to older participants. No changes were observed in terms of snack or alcoholic beverage intake logged. In conclusion, this study of 381,564 US participants revealed that intake of particular food groups were altered during the first weeks of COVID lockdown.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ellen Siobhan Mitchell","author_inst":"Noom Inc."},{"author_name":"Qiuchen Yang","author_inst":"Noom Inc."},{"author_name":"Heather Behr","author_inst":"Noom Inc., Saybrook University"},{"author_name":"Laura Deluca","author_inst":"Noom Inc., Yeshiva University"},{"author_name":"Paul Schaffer","author_inst":"Noom Inc."},{"author_name":"Kristine Marie Bermudez","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Eric D Weinhandl","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Ines A Dahne-Steuber","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Belmonte","author_inst":"Fresenius Kidney Care"},{"author_name":"Luca Neri","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, EMEA Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Peter Kotanko","author_inst":"Renal Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jeroen P Kooman","author_inst":"Maastricht University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Hymes","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Robert J Kossmann","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Len A Usvyat","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Franklin W Maddux","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co.

COVID-19 exhibits a more severe disease course in older, co-morbid adults. Awareness of atypical presentations is critical to facilitate early identification. Objective: To assess how frailty affects presenting COVID-19 symptoms in older adults. Design: Observational cohort study of hospitalised older patients and self-report data for community-based older adults. Setting: Admissions to St Thomas' Hospital, London with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Community-based data for 535 older adults using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application. Subjects: Hospital cohort: patients aged 65 and over (n=322); unscheduled hospital admission between March 1st, 2020 - May 5th, 2020; COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab. Community-based cohort: participants aged 65 and over enrolled in the COVID Symptom Study (n=535); reported test-positive for COVID-19 from March 24th (application launch)- May 8th, 2020. Methods: Multivariate logistic regression analysis performed on age-matched samples from hospital and community-based cohorts to ascertain association of frailty with symptoms of confirmed COVID-19. Results: Hospital cohort: significantly higher prevalence of delirium in the frail sample, with no difference in fever or cough. Community-based cohort: significantly higher prevalence of probable delirium in frailer, older adults, and fatigue and shortness of breath. Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating higher prevalence of delirium as a COVID-19 symptom in older adults with frailty compared to other older adults. This emphasises need for systematic frailty assessment and screening for delirium in acutely ill older patients in hospital and community settings. Clinicians should suspect COVID-19 in frail adults with delirium.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Beatrice Zazzara","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital, London, SE1 7EH; Department of Gerontology, Neuroscience and O"},{"author_name":"Rose S.

Infected individuals exhibit variable severity, with no relation between the number of cases and mortality, suggesting the involvement of the populational genetic constitution and previous cross-reactive immune contacts in the individuals' disease outcome. Methods: A clustering approach was conducted to investigate the involvement of human MHC alleles with individuals' outcomes. HLA frequencies from affected countries were used to fuel the Hierarchical Clusterization Analysis. The formed groups were compared regarding their death rates. To prospect the T cell targets in SARS-CoV-2, and by consequence, the epitopes that are conferring cross-protection in the current pandemic, we modeled 3D structures of HLA-A*02:01 presenting immunogenic epitopes from SAR-CoV-1, recovered from Immune Epitope Database. These pMHC structures were also compared with models containing the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 epitope, with alphacoronavirus sequences, and with a panel of immunogenic pMHC structures contained in CrossTope. Findings: The combined use of HLA-B*07, HLA-B*44, HLA-DRB1*03, and HLADRB1*04 allowed the clustering of affected countries presenting similar death rates, based only on their allele frequencies. SARS-CoV HLA-A*02:01 epitopes were structurally investigated. It reveals molecular conservation between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 peptides, enabling the use of formerly SARS-CoV-1 experimental epitopes to inspect actual targets that are conferring cross-protection. Alpha-CoVs and, impressively, viruses involved in human infections share fingerprints of immunogenicity with SARS-CoV peptides. Interpretation: Wide-scale HLA genotyping in COVID-19 patients shall improve prognosis prediction. Structural identification of previous triggers paves the way for herd immunity examination and wide spectrum vaccine development.

We need to understand the barriers and facilitators to receiving a future COVID-19 vaccine so that we can provide recommendations for the design of interventions aimed at maximising public acceptance. Design: Cross-sectional UK survey with older adults and patients with chronic respiratory disease. Methods: During the UK's early April 2020 'lockdown' period, 527 participants (311 older adults, mean age = 70.4 years; 216 chronic respiratory participants, mean age = 43.8 years) completed an online questionnaire assessing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, perceptions of COVID-19, and intention to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. A free text response (n=502) examined barriers and facilitators to uptake. The Behaviour Change Wheel informed the analysis of these responses, which were coded to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were identified. Results: Eighty-six percent of respondents want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This was positively correlated with the perception that COVID-19 will persist over time, and negatively associated with perceiving the media to have over-exaggerated the risk. The majority of barriers and facilitators were mapped onto the 'beliefs about consequences' TDF domain, with themes relating to personal health, health consequences to others, concerns of vaccine safety, and severity of COVID-19. Conclusions: Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination is currently high among high-risk individuals. Mass media interventions aimed at maximising vaccine uptake should utilise the BCTs of information about health, emotional, social and environmental consequences, and salience of consequences.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lynn Williams","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Allyson J Gallant","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Susan Rasmussen","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Louise A Brown Nicholls","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Nicola Cogan","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Karen Deakin","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"David Young","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Paul Flowers","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital, London, SE1 7EH"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital, London, SE1 7EH; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and "},{"author_name":"Maxim B.

Methods: We offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR and antibody (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG) testing, regardless of symptoms, to all residents (>=4 years) and workers in a San Francisco census tract (population: 5,174) at outdoor, community-mobilized events over four days. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence (PCR-positive) and cumulative incidence (antibody or PCR-positive) in the census tract and evaluated risk factors for recent (PCR-positive\/antibody-negative) versus prior infection (antibody-positive\/PCR-negative). SARS-CoV-2 genome recovery and phylogenetics were used to measure viral strain diversity, establish viral lineages present, and estimate number of introductions. Results: We tested 3,953 persons: 40% Latinx; 41% White; 9% Asian\/Pacific Islander; and 2% Black. Overall, 2.1% (83\/3,871) tested PCR-positive: 95% were Latinx and 52% asymptomatic when tested. 1.7% of residents and 6.0% of workers (non-census tract residents) were PCR-positive. Among 2,598 census tract residents, estimated point prevalence of PCR-positives was 2.3% (95%CI: 1.2-3.8%): 3.9% (95%CI: 2.0-6.4%) among Latinx vs. 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0-0.4%) among non-Latinx persons. Estimated cumulative incidence among residents was 6.1% (95%CI: 4.0-8.6%). Prior infections were 67% Latinx, 16% White, and 17% other ethnicities. Among recent infections, 96% were Latinx. Risk factors for recent infection were Latinx ethnicity, inability to shelter-in-place and maintain income, frontline service work, unemployment, and household income <$50,000\/year. Five SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic lineages were detected. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infections from diverse lineages continued circulating among low-income, Latinx persons unable to work from home and maintain income during San Francisco's shelter-in-place ordinance.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriel Chamie","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Carina Marquez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Emily Crawford","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"James Peng","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Maya Petersen","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Daniel Schwab","author_inst":"College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, MA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Schwab","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jackie Martinez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Diane Jones","author_inst":"Unidos en Salud\/United in Health, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Douglas Black","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Monica Gandhi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

It is vital to identify features of cases such as this so as to better understand the factors that promote superspreading events. Based on a conditional assumption that transmission during this outbreak was by inhalation of respiratory aerosol, we use the available evidence to infer the emission rate of airborne infectious quanta from the primary source. We also explore how the risk of infection would vary with several influential factors: the rates of removal of respiratory aerosol by ventilation; deposition onto surfaces; and viral decay. The results indicate an emission rate of the order of a thousand quanta per hour (mean [interquartile range] for this event = 970 [680-1190] quanta per hour) and demonstrate that the risk of infection is modulated by ventilation conditions, occupant density, and duration of shared presence with an infectious individual.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shelly L Miller","author_inst":"Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"William W Nazaroff","author_inst":"Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jose L Jimenez","author_inst":"Dept. of Chemistry and CIRES, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Atze Boerstra","author_inst":"REHVA (Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations), BBA Binnenmilieu, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Buonanno","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stephanie J Dancer","author_inst":"Edinburgh Napier University and NHS Lanarkshire, Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jarek Kurnitski","author_inst":"REHVA Technology and Research Committee, Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia"},{"author_name":"Linsey C Marr","author_inst":"Civil and Environmental Engineering, Virginia Tech, USA"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"International Laboratory for Air Quality and Heath (ILAQH), WHO Collaborating Centre for Air Quality and Health, School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Queen"},{"author_name":"Catherine Noakes","author_inst":"School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Monica Gandhi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

We report the clinical application of a machine learning-based digital protein microarray platform for rapid multiplex quantification of cytokines from critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the University of Michigan Hospital. The platform comprises two low-cost modules: (i) a semi-automated fluidic dispensing\/mixing module that can be operated inside a biosafety cabinet to minimize the exposure of technician to the virus infection and (ii) a 12-12-15 inch compact fluorescence optical scanner for the potential near-bedside readout. The platform enabled daily cytokine analysis in clinical practice with high sensitivity (<0.4pg\/mL), inter-assay repeatability (~10% CV), and near-real-time operation with a 10 min assay incubation. A cytokine profiling test with the platform allowed us to observe clear interleukin-6 (IL-6) elevations after receiving tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) while significant cytokine profile variability exists across all critically ill COVID-19 patients and to discover a weak correlation between IL-6 to clinical biomarkers, such as Ferritin and CRP. Our data revealed large subject-to-subject variability in a patient's response to anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19, reaffirming the need for a personalized strategy guided by rapid cytokine assays.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yujing Song","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yuxuan Ye","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Shiuan-Haur Su","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Andrew Stephens","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Tao Cai","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Meng-Ting Chung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Meilan Han","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Michael W.

At the same time, lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based occlusion in the small vessels of patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies (aPL) targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Case series have recently detected aPL in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL [anticardiolipin IgG\/IgM\/IgA, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I IgG\/IgM\/IgA, and anti- phosphatidylserine\/prothrombin (aPS\/PT) IgG\/IgM] in the sera of 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We detected aPS\/PT IgG in 24%, anticardiolipin IgM in 23%, and aPS\/PT IgM in 18%. Any aPL was present in 52% of patients using the manufacturer's threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff ([&ge;]40 units). Higher levels of aPL were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity (including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps\/NETs), higher platelet count, more severe respiratory disease, and lower glomerular filtration rate. Similar to patients with longstanding APS, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from control neutrophils. Furthermore, injection of these COVID-19 IgG fractions into mice accelerated venous thrombosis. Taken together, these studies suggest that a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL and that these aPL are potentially pathogenic.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Shanea K.

We aimed to investigate which specific responses from either cellular or humoral immunity associate to severity and progression of COVID-19. Methods: A cohort of 276 patients classified in mild, moderate and severe, was studied. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations were quantified by flow cytometry, and immunoglobulins and complement proteins by nephelometry. Results: At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B and NK cells associated to severity. However, only the proportion of B cells increased, while T and NK cells appeared unaffected. Accordingly, the number of plasma cells and circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) increased, but levels of IgM, IgA and IgG were unaffected. When degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients, suggesting an IgG consumption by complement activation or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Activated CD56-CD16+ NK-cells, which mediate ADCC, were increased. Regarding complement, C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, compared to healthy donors. Moreover, IgG and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier. Conclusion: Our study provides important clues to understand the immune response observed in COVID-19 patients, which is probably related to viral clearance, but also underlies its pathogenesis and severity. This study associates for the first time COVID-19 severity with an imbalanced humoral immune response characterized by excessive consumption of IgG and C4, identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Marcos-Jimenez","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Santiago Sanchez-Alonso","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ana Alcaraz-Serna","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Laura Esparcia","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Celia Lopez-Sanz","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Miguel Sampedro-Nunez","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Tamara Mateu-Albero","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ildefonso Sanchez-Cerrillo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

However, other modes of transmission also need to be clarified in more depth, especially, the foodborne transmission. We assessed the effect of animal origin foods consumption on the pandemic of COVID-19. For this purpose, we studied the relationship among 20 food supply as independent variables, and the parameter of Total Cases as dependent variable. Here we show a relationship between a group of animal origin foods and total cases. Regression, Bayes, and Lasso results showed that eggs and fresh water fish have positive coefficient. So, among the transmission ways of COVID_19, the role of foodborne transmission should be more significant than previously thought. The possibility of animal origin foodborne transmission should be taken into more consideration. The perspective is to expand the surveillance of SARS-Cov-2 during the food production chain. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that one important vehicle for SARS-Cov2 may be some of animal origin foods. It is recommended that virologists examine the possibility of freshwater fish and chickens eggs being as excellent vehicles\/preservatives for SARS-Cov2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nazli Saeedi","author_inst":"Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology"},{"author_name":"seyed rafat","author_inst":"university of Tabriz"},{"author_name":"Ana Alcaraz-Serna","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Laura Esparcia","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Celia Lopez-Sanz","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Miguel Sampedro-Nunez","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Tamara Mateu-Albero","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ildefonso Sanchez-Cerrillo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

We present both the deterministic and stochastic version fo the model and derive the R0 and the probability of local extinction after relaxation (elimination of transmission) of containment, P0. We show that local extinctions are possible without further interventions, with reasonable probability, as long as the number of active cases is driven to single digits and strict control of case importation is maintained. The maintenance of defensive behaviors, such as using masks and avoiding agglomerations are also important factors. We also explore the importance of population immunity even when above the herd immunity threshold.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavio Codeco Coelho","author_inst":"Fundacao Getulio Vargas"},{"author_name":"Luiz Max Carvalho","author_inst":"Fundacao Getulio Vargas"},{"author_name":"Raquel M Lana","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Oswaldo G Cruz","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Claudia T Codeco","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F C Gomes","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

Here, we develop a metapopulation SEIR disease model that uses dynamic mobility networks, derived from US cell phone data, to capture the hourly movements of millions of people from local neighborhoods (census block groups, or CBGs) to points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants, grocery stores, or religious establishments. We simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 - May 2, 2020 among a population of 98 million people in 10 of the largest US metropolitan statistical areas. We show that by integrating these mobility networks, which connect 57k CBGs to 553k POIs with a total of 5.4 billion hourly edges, even a relatively simple epidemiological model can accurately capture the case trajectory despite dramatic changes in population behavior due to the virus. Furthermore, by modeling detailed information about each POI, like visitor density and visit length, we can estimate the impacts of fine-grained reopening plans: we predict that a small minority of \"superspreader\" POIs account for a large majority of infections, that reopening some POI categories (like full-service restaurants) poses especially large risks, and that strategies restricting maximum occupancy at each POI are more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our models also predict higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups solely from differences in mobility: disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce mobility as sharply, and the POIs they visit (even within the same category) tend to be smaller, more crowded, and therefore more dangerous. By modeling who is infected at which locations, our model supports fine-grained analyses that can inform more effective and equitable policy responses to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Serina Y Chang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Emma Pierson","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pang Wei Koh","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jaline Gerardin","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Beth Redbird","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"David Grusky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jure Leskovec","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

We searched the COVID-19 portfolio of the National Institutes of Health for all studies that reported the prevalence of smell and\/or taste deficits in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Forty-two studies reporting on 23,353 patients qualified and were subjected to a systematic review and meta-analysis. Estimated random prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was 38.5%, of taste dysfunction was 30.4% and of overall chemosensory dysfunction was 50.2%. We examined the effects of age, disease severity, and ethnicity on chemosensory dysfunction. The effect of age did not reach significance, but anosmia\/hypogeusia decreased with disease severity, and ethnicity was highly significant: Caucasians had a 3-6 times higher prevalence of chemosensory deficits than East Asians. The finding of ethnic differences points to genetic, ethnicity-specific differences of the virus-binding entry proteins in the olfactory epithelium and taste buds as the most likely explanation, with major implications for infectivity, diagnosis and management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher S von Bartheld","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Molly M Hagen","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Rafal Butowt","author_inst":"Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz"},{"author_name":"Jaline Gerardin","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Beth Redbird","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"David Grusky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jure Leskovec","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

Many countries around the world implemented their own policies and restrictions designed to limit the spread of Covid-19 in recent months. Businesses and schools transitioned into working and learning remotely. In the United States, many states were under strict orders to stay home at least in the month of April. In recent weeks, there are some significant changes related restrictions include social-distancing, reopening states, and staying-at-home orders. The United States surpassed 2 million coronavirus cases on Monday, June 15, 2020 less than five months after the first case was confirmed in the country. The virus has killed at least 115,000 people in the United States as of Monday, June 15, 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. With the recent easing of coronavirus-related restrictions and changes on business and social activity such as stay-at-home, social distancing since late May 2020 hoping to restore economic and business activities, new Covid-19 outbreaks are on the rise in many states across the country. Some researchers expressed concern that the process of easing restrictions and relaxing stay-at-home orders too soon could quickly surge the number of infected Covid-19 cases as well as the death toll in the United States. Some of these increases, however, could be due to more testing sites in the communities while others may be are the results of easing restrictions due to recent reopening and changed policies, though the number of daily death toll does not appear to be going down in recent days due to Covid-19 in the U.S. This raises the challenging question: * How can policy decision-makers and community leaders make the decision to implement public policies and restrictions and keep or lift staying-at-home orders of ongoing Covid-19 pandemic for their communities in a scientific way? In this study, we aim to develop models addressing the effects of recent Covid-19 related changes in the communities such as reopening states, practicing social-distancing, and staying-at-home orders. Our models account for the fact that changes to these policies which can lead to a surge of coronavius cases and deaths, especially in the United States. Specifically, in this paper we develop a novel generalized mathematical model and several explicit models considering the effects of recent reopening states, staying-at-home orders and social-distancing practice of different communities along with a set of selected indicators such as the total number of coronavirus recovered and new cases that can estimate the daily death toll and total number of deaths in the United States related to Covid-19 virus. We compare the modeling results among the developed models based on several existing criteria. The model also can be used to predict the number of death toll in Italy and the United Kingdom (UK). The results show very encouraging predictability for the proposed models in this study. The model predicts that 128,500 to 140,100 people in the United States will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, 2020. The model also predicts that between 137,900 and 154,000 people will have died of Covid-19 by July 31, and 148,500 to 169,700 will have died by the end of August 2020, as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 based on the Covid-19 death data available on June 13, 2020. The model also predicts that 34,900 to 37,200 people in Italy will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, and 36,900 to 40,400 people will have died by the end of August based on the data available on June 13, 2020. The model also predicts that between 43,500 and 46,700 people in the United Kingdom will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, and 48,700 to 51,900 people will have died by the end of August, as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 based on the data available on June 13, 2020. The model can serve as a framework to help policy makers a scientific approach in quantifying decision-makings related to Covid-19 affairs.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hoang Pham","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Molly M Hagen","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Rafal Butowt","author_inst":"Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz"},{"author_name":"Jaline Gerardin","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Beth Redbird","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"David Grusky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jure Leskovec","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

In order to investigate the impact of weather conditions on daily transmission occurring in India, daily data of Maximum (TMax), Minimum (TMin), Mean (TMean) and Dew Point Temperature (TDew), Diurnal Temperature range (TRange), Average Relative Humidity, Range in Relative Humidity, and Wind Speed (WS) over 9 most affected cities are analysed in several time frames: weather of that day, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 days before transmission. Spearman rank correlation (r) shows significant but low correlation with most of the weather parameters, however, comparatively better association exists on 14 days lag. Diurnal range in Temperature and Relative Humidity shows non-significant correlation. Analysis shows, COVID-19 cases likely to be increased with increasing air temperature, however role of humidity is not clear. Among weather parameters, Minimum Temperature was relatively better correlate than other. 80% of the total confirmed cases were registered when TMax, TMean, TMin, TRange, TDew, and WS on 12-16 days ago vary within a range of 33.6-41.3 deg C, 29.8-36.5 deg C, 24.8-30.4 deg C, 7.5-15.2 deg C, 18.7-23.6 deg C, and 4.2-5.75 m\/s respectively, hence, it gives an idea of susceptible weather conditions for such transmission in India. Using Support Vector Machine based regression, the daily cases are profoundly estimated with more than 80% accuracy, which indicate that coronavirus transmission cannot be well linearly correlated with any single weather parameters, rather multivariate non-linear approach must be employed. Accounting lag of 12-16 days, the association found to be excellent, thus depict that there is an incubation period of 12-16 days for coronavirus transmission in Indian scenario.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amitesh Gupta","author_inst":"JIS University"},{"author_name":"Biswajeet Pradhan","author_inst":"School of Information, Systems & Modelling Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rafal Butowt","author_inst":"Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz"},{"author_name":"Jaline Gerardin","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Beth Redbird","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"David Grusky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jure Leskovec","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

Serological survey for COVID-19 antibodies is crucial in area with low prevalence as well as epidemic area when addressing health and social issues caused by COVID-19. Rapid, accurate and easy-to-use antibody tests as well laboratory-based antibody tests are necessary for confirming immunity in a given community. Methods:Serum samples from healthcare workers (n = 1,000, mean 40 {+\/-} 11 years) of Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital, Iwate, Japan were tested for the prevalence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. Two laboratory-based quantitative tests (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays) and one point-of-care (POC) qualitative test (Alfa Instant-view plus COVID-19 Test) were performed simultaneously. Sensitivity and specificity were 100%, 99.6% in Abbott assay; 100%, 99.8% in Roche assay; 97.8%, 94.6% in Alfa POC test, respectively. Results:The laboratory-based quantitative tests showed positive in 4 of 1,000 samples (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.79): 4\/1,000 (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.79) in Abbott; 0\/1,000 (0%) in Roche. Positive samples were not detected for both Abbott and Roche assays. The POC qualitative test showed positive in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% CI: 2.19 to 4.41), showing higher rates than those of the laboratory-based quantitative tests. There were no samples with simultaneous positive reaction for two quantitative tests and a POC test. Conclusions: Infected COVID-2 cases were not confirmed by a retrospective serological study in healthcare workers of our hospital. The POC qualitative tests with lower specificity have the potential for higher false positive reactions than the laboratory-based quantitative tests in areas with very low prevalence of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akihiro Nakamura","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ryoichi Sato","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanae Ando","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Natsuko Oana","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eiji Nozaki","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hideaki Endo","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yoshiharu Miyate","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Soma","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Go Miyata","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

For example, from knowledge of the infected population time series I(t) during the entire epidemic, the parameters can be successfully estimated. In this article we observe that estimation will fail in practice if only infected case data during the early part of the epidemic (pre-peak) is available. This fact can be explained using a long-known phenomenon called dynamical compensation. We use this concept to derive an unidentifiability manifold in the parameter space of SEIR that consists of parameters indistinguishable to I(t) early in the epidemic. Thus, identifiability depends on the extent of the system trajectory that is available for observation. Although the existence of the unidentifiability manifold obstructs the ability to exactly determine the parameters, we suggest that it may be useful for uncertainty quantification purposes. A variant of SEIR recently proposed for COVID-19 modeling is also analyzed, and an analogous unidentifiability surface is derived.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy Sauer","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Tyrus Berry","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Donald Ebeigbe","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Michael M.

Binding to shikonin and binding of covalent inhibitors show different binding modes, suggesting a diversity in inhibitor binding. As we learn more about different binding modes and their structure-function relationships, it is probable that we can design more effective and specific drugs with high potency that can serve as effect SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral agents.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xuelan Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Fanglin Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Crystalo Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Cheng Lin","author_inst":"Laboratory of Prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, Ministry of Education, Gannan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peter J.

Highly accurate detection of antibodies for COVID-19 is an indispensable part of the effort to combat the pandemic1,2. Here we developed two-plex antibody detection against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins3 (the S1 subunit and receptor binding domain RBD) in human serum and saliva on a near-infrared nano-plasmonic gold (pGOLD) platform4-8. By testing nearly 600 serum samples, pGOLD COVID-19 assay achieved ~ 99.78 % specificity for detecting both IgG and IgM with 100 % sensitivity in sera collected > 14 days post disease symptom onset, with zero cross-reactivity to other diseases. Two-plex correlation analysis revealed higher binding of serum IgM to RBD than to S1. IgG antibody avidity toward multiple antigens were measured, shedding light on antibody maturation in COVID-19 patients and affording a powerful tool for differentiating recent from remote infections and identifying re-infection by SARS-CoV-2. Just as important, due to high analytical sensitivity, the pGOLD COVID-19 assay detected minute amounts of antibodies in human saliva, offering the first non-invasive detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiancheng Liu","author_inst":"Nirmidas Biotech Inc."},{"author_name":"Jessica Hsiung","author_inst":"Nirmidas Biotech Inc."},{"author_name":"Su Zhao","author_inst":"Nirmidas Biotech Inc."},{"author_name":"Jessica Kost","author_inst":"Nirmidas Biotech Inc."},{"author_name":"Dee Sreedhar","author_inst":"Nirmidas Biotech Inc."},{"author_name":"Kjerstie Olson","author_inst":"Dr. Jack S.
