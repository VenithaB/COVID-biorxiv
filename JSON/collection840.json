This systematic review critically evaluates and synthesises the relevant peer-reviewed and pre-print literature published in recent months. Methods For this systematic review, independent keyword-structured literature searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer for studies published from 01\/01\/2020-26\/06\/2020. Papers were independently screened by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements by a third researcher. Data were independently extracted into a pre-designed Excel template and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. Results 61 articles were included. Almost all studies used observational designs, were hospital-based, and the majority had important limitations. Symptomatic adult COVID-19 cases consistently show peripheral T cell lymphopenia, which positively correlates with increased disease severity, duration of RNA positivity, and non-survival; while asymptomatic and paediatric cases display preserved counts. People with severe or critical disease generally develop more robust, virus-specific T cell responses. T cell memory and effector function has been demonstrated against multiple viral epitopes, and, cross-reactive T cell responses have been demonstrated in unexposed and uninfected adults, but the significance for protection and susceptibility, respectively, remains unclear. Interpretation A complex pattern of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, but inferences regarding population level immunity are hampered by significant methodological limitations and heterogeneity between studies. In contrast to antibody responses, population-level surveillance of the cellular response is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. Focused evaluation in specific sub-groups, including vaccine recipients, should be prioritised.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Madhumita Shrotri","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"May C I van Schalkwyk","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathan Post","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Danielle Eddy","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Catherine Huntley","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Leeman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Samuel Rigby","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarah V Williams","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William H Bermingham","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Paul Kellam","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"John Maher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Adrian M Shields","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Gayatri Amirthalingam","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sharon J Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sharif A Ismail","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20175745","rel_title":"Prevalence of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically-ill COVID-19 Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-08-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20175745","rel_abs":"Background: Recent studies revealed a high prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, especially in those who are critically ill. Available studies report varying prevalence rates. Hence, the exact prevalence remains uncertain. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate regarding the appropriate dosage of thromboprophylaxis. Methods: We performed a systematic review and proportion meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies exploring the prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients till 22\/07\/2020. We pooled the proportion of VTE. Additionally, in a subgroup analysis, we pooled VTE events detected by systematic screening. Finally, we compared the odds of VTE in patients on prophylactic compared to therapeutic anticoagulation. Results: The review comprised of 24 studies and over 2500 patients. The pooled proportion of VTE prevalence was 0.31 (95% CI 0.24, 0.39 I2 94%), of VTE utilizing systematic screening was 0.48 (95% CI 0.33, 0.63 I2 91%), of deep-venous-thrombosis was 0.23 (95% CI 0.14, 0.32 I2 96%), of pulmonary embolism was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09, 0.20 I2 90%). In a subgroup of studies, utilizing systematic screening, VTE risk increased significantly with prophylactic, compared to therapeutic anticoagulation (OR 5.45; 95% CI 1.90, 15.57 I2 0%). Discussion: Our review revealed a high prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Almost 50% of patients had VTE detected by systematic screening. Higher thromboprophylaxis dosages seem to reduce VTE burden in this patient's cohort compared to standard prophylactic anticoagulation; ongoing randomized controlled trials will further confirm this.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mouhand F.H.

Methods: A social network campaign on Instagram was raised to approach the target population. The dental students responded to a multiple-response question asking where they get information about COVID-19. The possible answers were government official websites or health and education institutions websites, TV Programs, professors, social media, scientific articles, other health professionals, and family members. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and frequency distributions of responses were evaluated by gender, age, type of institution, and year of enrollment. Results: A total of 833 valid responses were received. The main source of information used by the dental students were government official websites or health and education institutions websites (88.7%), other health professionals (57.3%), and scientific articles (56.2%). The use of social media was reported by 54.1% of the students, while TV programs were information sources used by 39.9% of the students. The least used information sources were professors (38.1%) and family members (7.8%). Conclusions: The respondents seem to be acquainted to seek information in reliable sources and also use social media as a gateway to keep updated about the pandemics. Therefore, knowing where the dental students seek information about COVID-19 might facilitate dental school directors to approach such public continuously, providing them with trustable information on different platforms.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Gerusa Brito Aragao","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Francisco Isaac Fernandes Gomes","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Camila Siqueira Silva Coelho","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Leticia Pinho Maia Paixao de Melo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Silmara Aparecida Milori Corona","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Shahd I.

We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by performing a curated compound screen along with structure-activity profiling of a series of small molecules to identify compounds with antiviral activity. Throughout these studies, we observed concordance between data emerging from this assay and from live virus assays.

The ability to model human trophectoderm disease states from human pluripotent stem cells, the nature of human pluripotent stem cell potency and the mechanisms regulating human trophectoderm specification remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that only the naive state can give rise to trophectoderm and that primed iPSC generate mixed amnionic and mesoderm lineages. Here we identify conditions that efficiently drive the specification of primed iPSC to trophectoderm, named Trophoblast Stem Cell (TSC). iPS-derived-TSC share transcriptional, morphological and functional characteristics with human in vivo cytotrophoblasts including activation of human endogenous retroviruses, expression of COVID-19 associated host factors and generation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts with a large fusion index. At high densities in 5% O2, iPS-derived-TSC form villi-like structures and express extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast proteins HCG-{beta} and HLA-G. Using temporal single cell RNAseq, we define the molecular changes associated with specification under three separate conditions: 1) BMP4, 2) BMP4 and inhibition of WNT, 3) activation of EGF and WNT, inhibition of TGFbeta, HDAC and ROCK signaling (named TSC). With 9,821 high-quality single cell transcriptomes, we find that BMP4 gives rise to mesenchymal cells while TS conditions lacking exogenous BMP4 generate a stable proliferating cell type that is highly similar to six week placenta cytotrophoblasts. TFAP2A programs the specification of primed iPS cells to TSC without transitioning through a naive state. TSC specification independent of exogenous BMP4 will allow for robust and reproducible studies of the cytotrophoblast component of human placenta.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ethan Tietze","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Andre Rocha Barbosa","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Veronica Euclydes","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Hyeon Jin Cho","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Yong Kyu Lee","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Arthur Feltrin","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Joyce van de Leemput","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Pasquale Di Carlo","author_inst":"Lieber Institute"},{"author_name":"Tomoyo Sawada","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Kynon J.

To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create molecular tools allowing to investigate, diagnose and treat COVID-19. One of such tools are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. These mAbs are able to specifically detect native and denaturized S protein in all tested applications including immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs decreased infection rate of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow to use the corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however due to the restrictions caused by pandemic, it is imperative to have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19. Moreover, as each mAb has a unique binding sequence, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins even if the virus acquires novel mutations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nadezhda V Antipova","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Tatyana D Larionova","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Michail I Shakhparonov","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Marat S Pavlyukov","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Yong Kyu Lee","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Arthur Feltrin","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Joyce van de Leemput","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Pasquale Di Carlo","author_inst":"Lieber Institute"},{"author_name":"Tomoyo Sawada","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Kynon J.

SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate complex pathogenic mechanisms that underlie COVID-19 disease. Thus, understanding how viral polypeptides rewire host protein networks enables better-founded therapeutic research. In complement to existing proteomic studies, in this study we define the first proximal interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, at the whole proteome level in human cells. Applying a proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID)-based approach greatly expanded the current knowledge by detecting interactions within poorly soluble compartments, transient, and\/or of weak affinity in living cells. Our BioID study was complemented by a stringent filtering and uncovered 2,128 unique cellular targets (1,717 not previously associated with SARS-CoV-1 or 2 proteins) connected to the N- and C-ter BioID-tagged 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by a total of 5,415 (5,236 new) proximal interactions. In order to facilitate data exploitation, an innovative interactive 3D web interface was developed to allow customized analysis and exploration of the landscape of interactions (accessible at http:\/\/www.sars-cov-2-interactome.org\/). Interestingly, 342 membrane proteins including interferon and interleukin pathways factors, were associated with specific viral proteins. We uncovered ORF7a and ORF7b protein proximal partners that could be related to anosmia and ageusia symptoms. Moreover, comparing proximal interactomes in basal and infection-mimicking conditions (poly(I:C) treatment) allowed us to detect novel links with major antiviral response pathway components, such as ORF9b with MAVS and ISG20; N with PKR and TARB2; NSP2 with RIG-I and STAT1; NSP16 with PARP9-DTX3L. Altogether, our study provides an unprecedented comprehensive resource for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate host proteome remodeling and innate immune response evasion, which can inform development of targeted therapeutic strategies.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Estelle MN Laurent","author_inst":"Univ.

One strategy to discourage the fomite-mediated spread of COVID-19 is the development of materials whose surface chemistry can spontaneously inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a material used in spine fusion surgery, is one such candidate because it has been shown to inactivate several bacterial species and viral strains. This study hypothesized that contact with Si3N4 would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while mammalian cells would remain unaffected.\n\nMaterialsSARS-CoV-2 virions (2x104 PFU\/mL diluted in growth media) were exposed to 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w\/v) of an aqueous suspension of sintered Si3N4 particles for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Before exposure to the virus, cytotoxicity testing of Si3N4 alone was assessed in Vero cells at 24 and 48 hour post-exposure times. Following each exposure to Si3N4, the remaining infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay.\n\nResultsVero cell viability increased at 5% and 10% (w\/v) concentrations of Si3N4 at exposure times up to 10 minutes, and there was only minimal impact on cell health and viability up to 20% (w\/v). However, the SARS-CoV-2 titers were markedly reduced when exposed to all concentrations of Si3N4; the reduction in viral titers was between 85% - 99.6%, depending on the dose and duration of exposure.\n\nConclusionsSi3N4 was non-toxic to the Vero cells while showing strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The viricidal effect increased with increasing concentrations of Si3N4 and longer duration of exposure. Surface treatment strategies based on Si3N4 may offer novel methods to discourage SARS-CoV-2 persistence and infectivity on surfaces and discourage the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caitlin W.

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface-exposed spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents a suitable target for the induction of neutralizing antibodies upon vaccination. Small protein antigens typically induce weak immune response while particles measuring tens of nanometers are efficiently presented to B cell follicles and subsequently to follicular germinal center B cells in draining lymph nodes, where B cell proliferation and affinity maturation occurs. Here we prepared and analyzed the response to several DNA vaccines based on genetic fusions of RBD to four different scaffolding domains, namely to the foldon peptide, ferritin, lumazine synthase and {beta}-annulus peptide, presenting from 6 to 60 copies of the RBD on each particle. Scaffolding strongly augmented the immune response with production of neutralizing antibodies and T cell response including cytotoxic lymphocytes in mice upon immunization with DNA plasmids. The most potent response was observed for the 24-residue {beta}-annulus peptide scaffold that forms large soluble assemblies, that has the advantage of low immunogenicity in comparison to larger scaffolds. Our results support the advancement of this vaccine platform towards clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dusko Lainscek","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Tina Fink","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Vida Forstneric","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Iva Hafner-Bratkovic","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Sara Orehek","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Ziga Strmsek","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Mateja Mancek Keber","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Peter Pecan","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Hana Esih","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Spela Malensek","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Jana Aupic","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Petra Dekleva","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Tjasa Plaper","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Sara Vidmar","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Lucija Kadunc","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Mojca Bencina","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Florence Pojer","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Kelvin Lau","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"David Hacker","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Correia","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"David Peterhoff","author_inst":"University Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralf Wagner","author_inst":"University Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Roman Jerala","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Georgios A Pavlopoulos","author_inst":"Institute for Fundamental Biomedical Research, BSRC \"Alexander Fleming\", 34 Fleming Street, 16672, Vari, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Van Der Werf","author_inst":"Departement de Virologie, Unite de Genetique Moleculaire des Virus a ARN (GMVR), Institut Pasteur, UMR3569, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Fournier","author_inst":"Univ.

The HK-13 and HK-95 isolates showed distinct pathogenicity in hamsters, with higher virus titers and more severe pathological changes in the lungs observed compared to other isolates. HK-95 contains a D614G substitution in the spike protein and demonstrated higher viral gene expression and transmission efficiency in hamsters.

This approach uncovered a virus-host topology network comprising 3566 proximity interactions amongst 1010 host proteins, highlighting extensive virus protein crosstalk with: (i) host protein folding and modification machinery; (ii) membrane-bound vesicles and organelles, and; (iii) lipid trafficking pathways and ER-organelle membrane contact sites. The design and implementation of sensitive mass spectrometric approaches for the analysis of complex biological samples is also important for both clinical and basic research proteomics focused on the study of COVID-19. To this end, we conducted a mass spectrometry-based characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and infected cell lysates, identifying 189 unique high-confidence virus tryptic peptides derived from 17 different virus proteins, to create a high quality resource for use in targeted proteomics approaches.

Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening and RNA sequencing, we show that remdesivir treatment leads to a repression of mitochondrial respiratory activity, and we identify five genes whose loss significantly reduces remdesivir cytotoxicity. In particular, we show that loss of the mitochondrial nucleoside transporter SLC29A3 mitigates remdesivir toxicity without a commensurate decrease in SARS-CoV-2 antiviral potency and that the mitochondrial adenylate kinase AK2 is a remdesivir kinase required for remdesivir efficacy and toxicity. This work elucidates the cellular mechanisms of remdesivir metabolism and provides a candidate gene target to reduce remdesivir cytotoxicity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lin Lin","author_inst":"Hubrecht Institute"},{"author_name":"Grace Yeo","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Callie J Donahue","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Robert A Davey","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Vinitha Macwan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Cancer Centre"},{"author_name":"Dae-Kyun Kim","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer J Knapp","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Frederick P.

To learn more about COVID-19 pathophysiology we performed secondary analyses of transcriptomic data from two in vitro (Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells) and one in vivo (Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice) models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found 1467 conserved differentially expressed host genes (differentially expressed in at least two of the three model system transcriptomes compared) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To find potential genetic factors associated with COVID-19, we analyzed these conserved differentially expressed genes using known human genotype-phenotype associations. Genome-wide association study enrichment analysis showed evidence of enrichment for GWA loci associated with platelet functions, blood pressure, body mass index, respiratory functions, and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, among others. Since human protein complexes are known to be directly related to viral infection, we combined and analyzed the conserved transcriptomic signature with SARS-CoV-2-host protein-protein interaction data and found more than 150 gene clusters. Of these, 29 clusters (with 5 or more genes in each cluster) had at least one gene encoding protein that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These clusters were enriched for different cell types in lung including epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell types suggesting their pathophysiological relevancy to COVID-19. Finally, pathway analysis on the conserved differentially expressed genes and gene clusters showed alterations in several pathways and biological processes that could enable in understanding or hypothesizing molecular signatures inducing pathophysiological changes, risks, or sequelae of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anil G Jegga","author_inst":"Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Grace Yeo","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Callie J Donahue","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Robert A Davey","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Vinitha Macwan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Cancer Centre"},{"author_name":"Dae-Kyun Kim","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer J Knapp","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Frederick P.

We used directed message passing neural network to first build a broad-spectrum anti-beta-coronavirus compound prediction model, which gave satisfactory predictions on newly reported active compounds against SARS-CoV-2. Then we applied transfer learning to fine-tune the model with the recently reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. The fine-tuned model was applied to screen a large compound library with 4.9 million drug-like molecules from ZINC15 database and recommended a list of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds for further experimental testing. As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally tested 7 high-scored compounds that also demonstrated good binding strength in docking study against the 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 and found one novel compound that inhibited the enzyme with an IC50 of 37.0 M. Our model is highly efficient and can be used to screen large compound databases with billions or more compounds to accelerate the drug discovery process for the treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiwei Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qi Sun","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Youjun Xu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Pei","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Luhua Lai","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Dae-Kyun Kim","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer J Knapp","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Frederick P.

We designed subunit vaccine candidates using self-assembling ferritin nanoparticles displaying one of two multimerized SARS-CoV-2 spikes: full-length ectodomain (S-Fer) or a C-terminal 70 amino-acid deletion (S{Delta}C-Fer). Ferritin is an attractive nanoparticle platform for production of vaccines and ferritin-based vaccines have been investigated in humans in two separate clinical trials. We confirmed proper folding and antigenicity of spike on the surface of ferritin by cryo-EM and binding to conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. After a single immunization of mice with either of the two spike ferritin particles, a lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay revealed mean neutralizing antibody titers at least 2-fold greater than those in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a single dose of S{Delta}C-Fer elicited significantly higher neutralizing responses as compared to immunization with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) monomer or spike ectodomain trimer alone. After a second dose, mice immunized with S{Delta}C-Fer exhibited higher neutralizing titers than all other groups. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multivalent presentation of SARS-CoV-2 spike on ferritin can notably enhance elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, thus constituting a viable strategy for single-dose vaccination against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abigail E.

Replicon, a non-infectious self-replicative viral RNA, could be a safe and effective tool for antiviral screening; however, SARS-CoV-2 replicon has not been reported yet. Herein, we generated a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 replicon. Eight fragments covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome except S, E, and M genes were amplified with HiBiT-tag sequence by PCR. The amplicons were ligated and in vitro transcribed to RNA. The cells electroporated with the replicon RNA showed more than 3,000 times higher luminescence than MOCK control cells at 24 hours post-electroporation, indicating robust viral translation and RNA replication. The replication was drastically inhibited by remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. The IC50 of remdesivir in this study was 0.29 M, generally consistent to the IC50 obtained using infectious SARS-CoV-2 in a previous study (0.77 M). Taken together, this system could be applied to the safe and effective antiviral screening without using infectious SARS-CoV-2.

Of thirty-two antibodies specific for the spike glycoprotein, ten recognised the receptor-binding domain (RBD), thirteen were specific for non-RBD epitopes on the S1 subunit, and nine recognised the S2 subunit. A subset of anti-spike antibodies (10 of 32) cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested, five targeted the non-RBD S1, and five targeted the S2 subunit. Of the plasmablast-derived MAbs reacting with nucleocapsid, over half of them (19 of 35) cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested. The cross-reactive plasmablast-derived antibodies harboured extensive somatic mutations, indicative of an expansion of memory B cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Non-competing pairs of neutralising antibodies were identified, which offer potential templates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tiong Tan","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting-Hua Chen","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chung-Guei Huang","author_inst":"Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memori"},{"author_name":"Ruth Harvey","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Saira Hussain","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Pin Chen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Adam Harding","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Javier Gilbert-Jaramillo","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Xu Liu","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Knight","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa Schimanski","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memori"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chun Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chien-Yu Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Shu-Hsing Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yhu-Chering Huang","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Tzou-Yien Lin","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Rolle Rahikainen","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark Howarth","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Jia-Tsrong Jan","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Che Ma","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

The polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultured at an airway-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) is an in vitro model mimicking the in vivo human mucociliary airway epithelium and supports the replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies only characterized short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an interval of approximately 7-10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors. We also identified that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect HAE from the basolateral side, and the dominant SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial cells are ciliated cells and goblet cells, whereas virus replication in basal cells and club cells was not detectable. Notably, virus infection immediately damaged the HAE, which is demonstrated by dispersed Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression without clear tight junctions and partial loss of cilia. Importantly, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 productive infection of HAE requires a high viral load of 2.5 x 105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of a high viral load and that epithelial renewal initiates and maintains a recurrent infection of HAE with SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siyuan Hao","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kang Ning","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Cagla Aksu Kuz","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kai Vorhies","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Ziying Yan","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Jianming Qiu","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Pin Chen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Adam Harding","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Javier Gilbert-Jaramillo","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Xu Liu","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Knight","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa Schimanski","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memori"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chun Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chien-Yu Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Shu-Hsing Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yhu-Chering Huang","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Tzou-Yien Lin","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Rolle Rahikainen","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark Howarth","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Jia-Tsrong Jan","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Che Ma","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

PF-00835231 is a pre-clinical lead compound with an alternate target, the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231 and remdesivir in A549+ACE2 cells, using isolates of two major SARS-CoV-2 clades. PF-00835231 is antiviral for both clades, and, in this assay, statistically more potent than remdesivir. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps and validates PF-00835231s time of action. Both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective antiviral for SARS-CoV-2, addresses concerns from non-human in vitro models, and supports further studies with this compound.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maren de Vries","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adil Mohamed","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachel Anne Prescott","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana Valero-Jimenez","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ludovic Desvignes","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Claire Steppan","author_inst":"Pfizer Discovery Sciences"},{"author_name":"Annaliesa Anderson","author_inst":"Pfizer Vaccine Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Joseph Binder","author_inst":"Pfizer Oncology Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Meike Dittmann","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xu Liu","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Knight","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa Schimanski","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memori"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chun Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chien-Yu Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Shu-Hsing Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yhu-Chering Huang","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Tzou-Yien Lin","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Rolle Rahikainen","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark Howarth","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Jia-Tsrong Jan","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Che Ma","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

Here we examine the properties of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations at the S protein cleavage site that undergo inefficient proteolytic cleavage. Virus variants with S gene mutations generated smaller plaques and exhibited a more limited range of cell tropism compared to the wild-type strain. These alterations were shown to result from their inability to utilize the entry pathway involving direct fusion mediated by the host type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2. Notably, viruses with S gene mutations emerged rapidly and became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in TMPRSS2-deficient cells including Vero cells. Our study demonstrated that the S protein polybasic cleavage motif is a critical factor underlying SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell tropism.

In this study, we established a SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including a SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Moreover, based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris (CHPV) and a compound, suramin, displayed potent inhibitory effects on both wild type and mutant (G614) SCoV-2 SP pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs)-mediated infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for CHPV and suramin on SCoV-2-SP-PVs are 30, and 40 g\/ml, respectively. To define the mechanisms of their actions, we demonstrated that both CHPV and suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2-SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, our results also showed that CHPV or suramin can efficiently reduce levels of cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19\/Canada\/ON-VIDO-01\/2020) infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the combination of CHPV\/suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs. Overall, this study provides evidence that CHPV and suramin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhujun Ao","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Mable Chan","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Maggie Jing Ouyang","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Titus Abiola Olukitibi","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Mona Mahmoudi","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Darwyn Kobasa","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Yao","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Sawa","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Meike Dittmann","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xu Liu","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Knight","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa Schimanski","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memori"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chun Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chien-Yu Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Shu-Hsing Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yhu-Chering Huang","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Tzou-Yien Lin","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Rolle Rahikainen","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark Howarth","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Jia-Tsrong Jan","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Che Ma","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

Remarkably 14 of the compounds at 100-M concentration were found to reduce the enzymatic activity and 5 provided IC50 values below 40 M: manidipine (4.8 M), boceprevir (5.4 M), lercanidipine (16.2 M), bedaquiline (18.7 M), and efonidipine (38.5 M). Structural analyses reveal a common cloverleaf pattern for the binding of the active compounds to the P1, P1, and P2 pockets of Mpro.

It has affected the whole world including Odisha, a state in eastern India. Many people migrated in the state from different countries as well as states during this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As per the protocol laid by ICMR and Health & Family welfare of India, all the suspected cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to analyze the RNA binding domain (RBD) sequence of spike protein from the isolates collected from the throat swab samples of COVID-19 positive cases and further to assess the RBD affinity with ACE2 of different species including human.\n\nWhole genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive patients was performed using ARTIC amplicon based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the Spike and RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor of five different species was also analysed.\n\nExcept three isolates, spike region of 32 isolates showed one\/multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison to the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutation at 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C) in the RBD of spike protein was identified which depicted a stronger binding affinity with human ACE2 receptor compared to the wild type RBD. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates are capable of binding to ACE2 of human, bat, hamster and pangolin.\n\nAs mutated RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. The study shows that RBDs of all the studied isolates have binding affinity for all the five species, which suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pujarini Dash","author_inst":"ICMR-RMRC, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Jyotirmayee Turuk","author_inst":"ICMR-RMRC, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Santosh Ku.

In COVID-19, the infection and immune hyperactivation causes accumulation of inflammatory immune cells, blood clots, and protein aggregates in lung fluid, increased lung alveolar wall thickness, and upregulation of serum cytokine levels. A serum protein called serum amyloid P (SAP) has a calming effect on the innate immune system and shows efficacy as a therapeutic for fibrosis in animal models and clinical trials. In this report, we show that aspiration of the GU-rich ssRNA oligonucleotide ORN06 into mouse lungs induces all of the above COVID-19-like symptoms. Men tend to have more severe COVID-19 symptoms than women, and in the aspirated ORN06 model, male mice tended to have more severe symptoms than female mice. Intraperitoneal injections of SAP starting from day 1 post ORN06 aspiration attenuated the ORN06-induced increase in the number of inflammatory cells and formation of clot-like aggregates in the mouse lung fluid, reduced ORN06-increased alveolar wall thickness and accumulation of exudates in the alveolar airspace, and attenuated an ORN06-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in serum. Together, these results suggest that aspiration of ORN06 is a simple model for both COVID-19 as well as cytokine storm in general, and that SAP is a potential therapeutic for diseases with COVID-19-like symptoms as well as diseases that generate a cytokine storm.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tejas R Karhadkar","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Darrell Pilling","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Richard H.
