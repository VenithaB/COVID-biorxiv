Since the start of July, cases have increased, while deaths have continued to decrease. Methods We report results from 594,000 swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained from a representative sample of people in England over four rounds collected regardless of symptoms, starting in May 2020 and finishing at the beginning of September 2020. Swabs for the most recent two rounds were taken between 24th July and 11th August and for round 4 between 22nd August and 7th September. We estimate weighted overall prevalence, doubling times between and within rounds and associated reproduction numbers. We obtained unweighted prevalence estimates by sub-groups: age, sex, region, ethnicity, key worker status, household size, for which we also estimated odds of infection. We identified clusters of swab-positive participants who were closer, on average, to other swab-positive participants than would be expected. Findings Over all four rounds of the study, we found that 72% (67%, 76%) of swab-positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of swab and in the week prior. The epidemic declined between rounds 1 and 2, and rounds 2 and 3. However, the epidemic was increasing between rounds 3 and 4, with a doubling time of 17 (13, 23) days corresponding to an R value of 1.3 (1.2, 1.4). When analysing round 3 alone, we found that the epidemic had started to grow again with 93% probability. Using only the most recent round 4 data, we estimated a doubling time of 7.7 (5.5, 12.7) days, corresponding to an R value of 1.7 (1.4, 2.0). Cycle threshold values were lower (viral loads were higher) for rounds 1 and 4 than they were for rounds 2 and 3. In round 4, we observed the highest prevalence in participants aged 18 to 24 years at 0.25% (0.16%, 0.41%), increasing from 0.08% (0.04%, 0.18%) in round 3. We observed the lowest prevalence in those aged 65 and older at 0.04% (0.02%, 0.06%) which was stable compared with round 3. Participants of Asian ethnicity had elevated odds of infection. We identified clusters in and around London, transient clusters in the Midlands, and an expanding area of clustering in the North West and more recently in Yorkshire and the Humber. Interpretation Although low levels of transmission persisted in England through to mid-summer 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is now increasing. We found evidence of accelerating transmission at the end of August and beginning of September. Representative community antigen sampling can increase situational awareness and help improve public health decision making even at low prevalence.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Kylie E.

We aimed to investigate the burden of superinfections in COVID-19 patients. Methods In this prospective single centre cohort study in an intensive care setting patients aged [&ge;] 18 years with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome were assessed for concomitant microbial infections by longitudinal analysis of tracheobronchial secretions, bronchoalveolar lavages and blood. Our primary outcome was ventilator-free survival on day 28 in patients with and without clinically relevant superinfection. Further outcomes included the association of superinfection with ICU length of stay, incidence of bacteremia, viral reactivations, and fungal colonization. Results In 45 critically ill COVID-19 patients, we identified 19 patients with superinfections (42.2%) by longitudinal analysis of 433 TBS, 35 BAL and 455 blood samples, respectively. On average, superinfections were detected on day 10 after ICU admission. The most frequently isolated clinically relevant bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ventilator-free survival was substantially lower in patients with superinfection (subhazard ratio 0.37, 95%-CI 0.15-0.90, p=0.028). Patients with pulmonary superinfections more often had bacteraemia, virus reactivations, yeast colonization, and needed ICU treatment for a significantly longer time. Conclusions The detection of superinfections was frequent and associated with reduced ventilator-free survival. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy, superinfections lead to an extended ICU stay in COVID 19 patients. Longitudinal microbiological sampling in COVID-19 patients could allow targeted antimicrobial therapy, and therefore minimize the use of broad-spectrum and reserve antibiotics.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philipp K Buehler","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Annelies S Zinkernagel","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Andrea Hofmaenner","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pedro David Wendel Garcia","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Claudio T Acevedo","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Gomez-Mejia","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Srikanth Mairpady Shambat","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Federica Andreoni","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Maibach Maibach","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Jan Bartussek","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Matthias Hilty","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pascal M Frey","author_inst":"Department of General Internal Medicine, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Reto A Schuepbach","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvio Daniel Brugger","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Paul Elliott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20190686","rel_title":"Mortality and risk factors among US Black, Hispanic, and White patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190686","rel_abs":"Background: Little is known about risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes, particularly across diverse racial and ethnic populations in the United States. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we followed 3,086 COVID-19 patients hospitalized on or before April 13, 2020 within an academic health system in New York (The Mount Sinai Health System) until June 2, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The analysis was stratified by self-reported race and ethnicity. Findings: A total of 3,086 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized, of whom 680 were excluded (78 due to missing race or ethnicity data, 144 were Asian, and 458 were of other unspecified race\/ethnicity). Of the 2,406 patients included, 892 (37.1%) were Hispanic, 825 (34.3%) were black, and 689 (28.6%) were white. Black and Hispanic patients were younger than White patients (median age 67 and 63 vs. 73, p<0.001 for both), and they had different comorbidity profiles. Older age and baseline hypoxia were associated with increased mortality across all races. There were suggestive but non-significant interactions between Black race and diabetes (p=0.09), and obesity (p=0.10). Among inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 mortality, there was a significant interaction between Black race and interleukin-1-beta (p=0.04), and a suggestive interactions between Hispanic ethnicity and procalcitonin (p=0.07) and interleukin-8 (p=0.09). Interpretation: In this large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients in New York City, we identified similarities and important differences across racial and ethnic groups in risk factors for in-hospital mortality.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tomi Jun","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sharon Nirenberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kuan-lin Huang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Claudio T Acevedo","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Gomez-Mejia","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Srikanth Mairpady Shambat","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Federica Andreoni","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Maibach Maibach","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Jan Bartussek","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Matthias Hilty","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pascal M Frey","author_inst":"Department of General Internal Medicine, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Reto A Schuepbach","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvio Daniel Brugger","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Paul Elliott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.10.20186064","rel_title":"Mitochondrial induced T cell apoptosis and aberrant myeloid metabolic programs define distinct immune cell subsets during acute and recovered SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.10.20186064","rel_abs":"It remains unclear why some patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 readily resolve infection while others develop severe disease. To address this question, we employed a novel assay to interrogate immune-metabolic programs of T cells and myeloid cells in severe and recovered COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we identified a unique population of T cells expressing high H3K27me3 and the mitochondrial membrane protein voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which were expanded in acutely ill COVID-19 patients and distinct from T cells found in patients infected with hepatitis c or influenza and in recovered COVID-19. Increased VDAC was associated with gene programs linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. High-resolution fluorescence and electron microscopy imaging of the cells revealed dysmorphic mitochondria and release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, indicative of apoptosis activation. The percentage of these cells was markedly increased in elderly patients and correlated with lymphopenia. Importantly, T cell apoptosis could be inhibited in vitro by targeting the oligomerization of VDAC or blocking caspase activity. In addition to these T cell findings, we also observed a robust population of Hexokinase II+ polymorphonuclear-myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC), exclusively found in the acutely ill COVID-19 patients and not the other viral diseases. Finally, we revealed a unique population of monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) expressing high levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a) and VDAC. The metabolic phenotype of these cells was not only highly specific to COVID-19 patients but the presence of these cells was able to distinguish severe from mild disease. Overall, the identification of these novel metabolic phenotypes not only provides insight into the dysfunctional immune response in acutely ill COVID-19 patients but also provide a means to predict and track disease severity as well as an opportunity to design and evaluate novel metabolic therapeutic regimens.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth Thompson","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Cascino","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Ordonez","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Weiqiang Zhou","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Ajay Vaghasia","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Anne Hamacher-Brady","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Nathan Brady","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Im-Hong Sun","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Rulin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Avi Rosenberg","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Delanoy","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Richard Eric Rothman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katherine Fenstermacher","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lauren Sauer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Shaw-Saliba","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Hospital"},{"author_name":"Evan M Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Redd","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aaron AR Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maureen Horton","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Kellie Smith","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pekosz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Franco D'Alessio","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Hongkai Ji","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Andrea L Cox","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D Powell","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.10.20192104","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Formation Among Healthcare Workers","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.10.20192104","rel_abs":"Many frontline healthcare workers throughout the world have been exposed to COVID-19 infection in the workplace and the community.

Here, we analyze experimental data and perform model calculations to show that this contrast can be explained by the different abundance regimes between particles and viruses. Upon short-term exposure, respiratory particles are usually in a particle-rich regime, but respiratory viruses are often in a virus-limited regime where the numbers of viruses inhaled by susceptible people are below or close to the infectious dose. This virus-limited regime ensures mask efficacy and synergy of multiple preventive measures in reducing the infection risk.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yafang Cheng","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Nan Ma","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Christian Witt","author_inst":"Department of Outpatient Pneumology, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Steffen Rapp","author_inst":"University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz"},{"author_name":"Philipp Wild","author_inst":"University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz"},{"author_name":"Meinrat O.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our hospital's current nosocomial infection control, we conducted a serological survey of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (immunoglobulin G) among the staff of our hospital, which is treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G in the participants using a laboratory-based quantitative test (Abbott immunoassay), which has a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99.6%, respectively. To investigate the factors associated with seropositivity, we also obtained some information from the participants with an anonymous questionnaire. Results: We invited 1133 staff members in our hospital, and 925 (82%) participated. The mean age of the participants was 40.0{+\/-}11.8 years, and most were women (80.0%). According to job title, there were 149 medical doctors or dentists (16.0%), 489 nurses (52.9%), 140 medical technologists (14.2%), 49 healthcare providers (5.3%), and 98 administrative staff (10.5%). The overall prevalence of seropositivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.43% (4\/925), which was similar to the control seroprevalence of 0.54% (16\/2970)) in the general population in Osaka during the same period according to a government survey conducted with the same assay.

We compared the performance of qRT-PCR in direct heat-inactivated, heat-inactivated\/pelleted samples against RNA in a group of 74 subjects (44 positive and 30 negative). In addition, we compared the sensitivity of heat-inactivated\/pelleted in another group of 196 COVID-19 positive samples. Our study suggests that swab sample heat-inactivation and pelleting show higher accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection PCR assay compared to heat-inactivation only (89% vs 83% of the detection in RNA). The accuracy of detection using direct samples varied depending on the sample transport and storage media as well as the viral titer. Our study suggests that purified RNA provides more accurate results, however, direct qRT-PCR may help to significantly increase testing capacity.

Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is a marker of pulmonary oedema which is associated with mortality in ARDS. In this study we evaluate whether EVLWI is higher in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS as compared to controls and whether EVLWI has the potential to monitor disease progression. METHODS: From the day of intubation, EVLWI, cardiac function were monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution in n=25 patients with COVID-19 and compared to a control group of 49 non-COVID-19 ARDS-patients. RESULTS: EVLWI in COVID-19-patients was noticeably elevated and significantly higher than in the control group (17 (11-38) vs. 11 (6-26) mL\/kg; p<0.001). High pulmonary vascular permeability index values (2.9 (1.0-5.2) versus 1.9 (1.0-5.2); p=0.003) suggest inflammatory oedema. By contrast, the cardiac parameters SVI, GEF and GEDVI were comparable. High EVLWI values were associated with viral persistence, prolonged intensive care treatment and mortality (23.2{+\/-}6.7% vs. 30.3{+\/-}6.0%, p=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the control group, COVID-19 results in markedly elevated EVLWI-values in patients with ARDS. EVLWI reflects a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 associated ARDS and could serve as parameter to monitor ARDS progression.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastian Rasch","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Paul Schmidle","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Biedersteiner Str. 29, 80802 Munich"},{"author_name":"Senguel Sancak","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Alexander Herner","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Christina Huberle","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Dominik Schulz","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Mayr","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Jochen Schneider","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Christoph Spinner","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Fabian Geisler","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Roland M.

In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence SARS-CoV-2 severity. Findings: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyses. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P=2.19x10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P=9.04x10-12). Further analyses using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protecting the body from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P=2.32x10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence SARS-CoV-2 severity was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P=0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in the bodys inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples. Interpretation: Our findings highlight several key proteins which are influenced by established exposures for disease. Future research to determine whether these circulating proteins mediate environmental effects onto risk of SARS-CoV-2 are warranted to help elucidate therapeutic strategies for covid-19 disease severity.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom G Richardson","author_inst":"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Si Fang","author_inst":"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Ruth E Mitchell","author_inst":"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Michael V Holmes","author_inst":"MRC Population Health Research Unit"},{"author_name":"George Davey Smith","author_inst":"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Dominik Schulz","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Mayr","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Jochen Schneider","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Christoph Spinner","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Fabian Geisler","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Roland M.

Since many infections, even among the elderly and other vulnerable populations, are asymptomatic, the prevalence of antibodies could help determine how far along the path to herd immunity the general population has progressed. Also, in order to clarify the clinical manifestations of current or recent past COVID-19 illness, it may be useful to determine if there are any common alterations in routine clinical laboratory values. Methods: We performed SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests on 50,130 consecutive life insurance applicants who were having blood drawn for the purpose of underwriting (life risk assessment). Subjects were also tested for lipids, liver function tests, renal function studies, as well as serum proteins. Other variables included height, weight, blood pressure at the time of the blood draw, and history of common chronic diseases (hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer). Results: The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.0%, and was fairly consistent across the age range and similar in males and females. Several of the routine laboratory tests obtained were significantly different in antibody-positive vs. antibody-negative subjects, including albumin, globulins, bilirubin, and the urine albumin:creatinine ratio. The BMI was also significantly higher in the antibody-positive group. Geographical distribution revealed a very high level of positivity in the state of New York compared to all other areas (17.1%). Using state population data from the US Census, it is estimated that this level of seropositivity would correspond to 6.98 million (99% CI: 6.56-7.38 million) SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US, which is 3.8 times the cumulative number of cases in the US reported to the CDC as of June 1, 2020. Conclusions: The estimated number of total SARS-CoV-2 infections based on positive serology is substantially higher than the total number of cases reported to the CDC.

Objective: To evaluate the associations of circulating total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), and SHBG with COVID-19 mortality. Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: We included 1306 COVID-19 patients (678 men and 628 women) who had serum TT and SHBG measurements and were free of cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline (2006-2010). Main outcome measures: The death cases of COVID-19 were identified from National Health Service death records updated at 31 July 2020. Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality. Results: We documented 315 deaths of COVID-19 (194 men and 121 women). After adjusting for potential confounders, we did not find any statistically significant associations for TT (OR per 1-SD increase = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.85-1.25), FT (OR per 1-SD increase = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.77-1.17), or SHBG (OR per 1-SD increase = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.87-1.37) with COVID-19 mortality in men.

This allows us to exploit the sophisticated functionality of a commercial chemical engineering simulator capable of parameter regression with piecewise continuous integration and event and discontinuity management. Our results provide insights into the outcomes of on-going disease suppression measures, while visualisation of reported data also provides up-to-date condition monitoring of the status of the pandemic.

This study aimed to assess the early impact of COVID-19 on immunization activities by comparing current trends to trends over the past year when vaccine coverage of major antigens (BCG, OPV, DTC, MMR, IPV, and Td) had improved considerably. Methods: The study was carried out at the Expanded Vaccination Program (EPI) of the Republic of Guinea from February 2019 to June 2019. It was a comparative retrospective cohort study on the trends in administrative coverage of the different antigens used in the framework of vaccination. We performed interrupted time series (STI) analysis using the delayed dependent variable model ANCOVA type II Sum Squares with significance for a p-value less than 0.05 to confirm the link between the occurrence of Covid-19 and the collapse of vaccine coverage. These analyzes were performed on global vaccine-preventable disease surveillance data extracted from the District Immunization Data Management Tool (DVD-MT) designed by WHO. Estimates of the target population were obtained from the National Health Information System (SNIS), and surveillance data for Covid-19 patients were obtained from the National Health Security Agency (ANSS). Results: Overall, the EPI recorded a median vaccination coverage of less than 80% for all the vaccines introduced and the analysis of the interrupted time series shows that the interruption of the vaccination program was significant for all the vaccines. This finding is factual at both the national and district levels. However, there are disparities at this level, even though some districts have yet to report cases of COVID-19 but have experienced drop-in vaccination coverage. The comparison of vaccination coverage for DTP3, for example, shows a sharp drop in the prefectures of Yomou, N'Nzerekore, Macenta, Kankan, Mandiana, Dinguiraye, Mamou, Koubia, Mali, and Conakry, where it varies between 0 and 80% compared to 2019 where it was above 80%. Conclusion: Our results express the need for a resilient health system that could adapt quickly and effectively to pandemics and which in turn makes it possible to strengthen EPI activities in Guinea during this period of a health crisis, in particular for children.

Design: A national cross-sectional community survey. Participants: Australian adults aged 18 years and over (n=1369). Main outcome measures: Telehealth experiences. Results: Of the 596 telehealth users, the majority of respondents (62%) rated their telehealth experience as \"just as good\" or \"better\" than a traditional in-person medical appointment. On average, respondents perceived that telehealth would be moderately to very useful for medical appointments after the COVID-19 pandemic is over (M=3.67 out of 5, SD=1.1). Being male (p=0.007), having a history of both depression and anxiety (p=0.037), or lower patient activation (individuals' willingness to take on the role of managing their health\/healthcare) (p=0.037) were associated with a poorer telehealth experience. Six overarching themes were identified from free-text responses of why telehealth experience was poorer than a traditional in-person medical appointment: communication is not as effective; limitations with technology; issues with obtaining prescriptions and pathology; reduced confidence in doctor; additional burden for complex care; and inability to be physically examined. Conclusions: Telehealth appointments were reported to be comparable to traditional in-person medical appointments by most of our sample. Telehealth should continue to be offered as a mode of healthcare delivery while the pandemic continues and may be worthwhile beyond the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer MJ Isautier","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Tessa Copp","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Julie Ayre","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Erin Cvejic","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Carys Batcup","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Carissa Bonner","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rachael Dodd","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Brooke Nickel","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kristen Pickles","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dakin","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kirsten J McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Aboubacar Sidiki Magassouba","author_inst":"Expanded Immunization Program (Consultant), Guinea"},{"author_name":"Arsen Arakelyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit Jangra","author_inst":"Mount Sinai School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alev Celikgil","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

Methods: 235 tissue donors at the Lille Tissue bank between November 1, 2019 and March 16, 2020 were included. Archived serum samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two FDA-approved kits. Results: Most donors were at higher risks for severe COVID-19 illness including age over 65 years (142\/235) and\/or presence of co-morbidities (141\/235). According to the COVID-19 risk assessment of transmission, 183 out of 235 tissue donors presented with a low risk level and 52 donors with an intermediate risk level of donor derived infection. Four out of the 235 (1.7%) tested specimens were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: 2 donors with anti-N protein IgG and 2 other donors with anti-S protein total Ig. None of them had both type of antibodies. Conclusion: Regarding the seroprevalence among tissue donors, we concluded that the transmission probability to recipient via tissue products was very low at the beginning of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Germain","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Herwegh","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Hatzfeld","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bocket","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Virology laboratory, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Prevost","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Virology laboratory, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Pierre Marie Danze","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Philippe Marchetti","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Rachael Dodd","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Brooke Nickel","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kristen Pickles","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dakin","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kirsten J McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Aboubacar Sidiki Magassouba","author_inst":"Expanded Immunization Program (Consultant), Guinea"},{"author_name":"Arsen Arakelyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit Jangra","author_inst":"Mount Sinai School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alev Celikgil","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

One standard deviation increases in average staff tract population density, public transportation use, and non-white share were associated with 1.3 (SE .33), 1.4 (SE .35), and 0.9 (SE .24) additional deaths per 100 beds, respectively. These effects are larger than all facility management or quality variables, and larger than the effect of the nursing home's own neighborhood characteristics.

Rapid and early detection of the virus is the master key to cease the rapid spread and break the human transmission chain. There are very few studies in search of an alternate and convenient diagnostic tool which can substitute nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyse the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We used real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We use Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two sampling methods. Findings This study shows a lower CT mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) sampling method. Bland-Altman analysis produces relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these specimen tools. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and Spike gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples. Interpretation: In conclusion, our study highlights that saliva represents a promising tool in COVID-19 diagnosis and would reduce the exposure risk of frontline health workers which is one of biggest concern in primary healthcare settings.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dr. Debdutta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"ICMR - Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Debaprasad Parai","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Usha Kiran Rout","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Ranjan Nanda","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Srikanta Kanungo","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Girish Chandra Dash","author_inst":"ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Subrat Kumar Palo","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Siddharth Giri","author_inst":"ICMR- Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Hari Ram Choudhary","author_inst":"ICMR- Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Jaya Singh Kshatri","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Jyotirmayee Turuk","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Bijay Mishra","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Saroj Dash","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Sanghamitra Pati","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Arsen Arakelyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit Jangra","author_inst":"Mount Sinai School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alev Celikgil","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

UK universities typically host 20,000 to 40,000 undergraduate students, with the majority moving away from home to attend. In the absence of realistic mixing patterns, previous models suggest that outbreaks associated with universities re-opening are an eventuality. Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model based on realistic mixing patterns between students. We evaluated alternative mitigation interventions for a representative university. Results: Our model predicts, for a set of plausible parameter values, that if asymptomatic cases are half as infectious as symptomatic cases then 5,760 (3,940 - 7,430) out of 28,000 students, 20% (14% - 26%), could be infected during the first term, with 950 (656 - 1,209) cases infectious on the last day of term. If asymptomatic cases are as infectious as symptomatic cases then three times as many cases could occur, with 94% (93% - 94%) of the student population getting infected during the first term. We predict that one third of infected students are likely to be in their first year, and first year students are the main drivers of transmission due to high numbers of contacts in communal residences. We find that reducing face-to-face teaching is likely to be the single most effective intervention, and this conclusion is robust to varying assumptions about asymptomatic transmission. Supplementing reduced face-to-face testing with COVID-secure interactions and reduced living circles could reduce the percentage of infected students by 75%. Mass testing of students would need to occur at least fortnightly, is not the most effective option considered, and comes at a cost of high numbers of students requiring self-isolation. When transmission is controlled in the student population, limiting imported infection from the community is important. Conclusions: Priority should be given to understanding the role of asymptomatic transmission in the spread of COVID-19. Irrespective of assumptions about asymptomatic transmission, our findings suggest that additional outbreak control measures should be considered for the university setting. These might include reduced face-to-face teaching, management of student mixing and enhanced testing. Onward transmission to family members at the end of term is likely without interventions.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Hannah Christensen","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Adam Trickey","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Gibran Hemani","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Emily Nixon","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Amy Thomas","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Katy Turner","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Adam Finn","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Matt Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Caroline Relton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Samuel Le Pape","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse, Inserm U 1193 ; Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay Villejuif, APHP Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"Rim Kallala","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse"},{"author_name":"Alice Rochard","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital de Bicetre"},{"author_name":"Celine Verstuyft","author_inst":"Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine Paris-Sud, Univ Paris-Sud, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay; INSERM U1184; Service de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique mol\u00e9culaire, Pharmacog\u00e9n\u00e9tique et H"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fortineau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Anne-Marie Roque-Afonso","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse, Inserm U 1193 ; Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay Villejuif, APHP Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"Thierry Naas","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

As of August 5, 2020, there were more than 4.8M confirmed and probable cases and 159K deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, with these numbers undoubtedly reflecting a significant underestimate of the true toll. Geographic, racial-ethnic, age and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality are key features of the first and second wave of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. Methods. We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race\/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. Findings. In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups other than Native Americans. Of these, Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age- standardized incidence = 1,644\/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 251\/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.6 (95% CI = 5.5, 5.7) and 6.9 (6.5, 7.3) times higher than Whites, respectively. We also found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. Interpretation.

The knowledge and practices of the public play an important role in curbing the spreading of the virus by following the health guidelines. This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practices of Iraqi living in Mosul-Iraq towards novel coronavirus during its rapid rise. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 909 participants was conducted among Mosul-Iraq between 20th June to 1st July 2020. The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) participants' knowledge, 3) participants' practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Results: The results showed knowledge and practice mean score of (12.91\\1.67) and (21.56\\2.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards 2019-nCoV. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice towards the virus as P<0.05. Conclusions: We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of knowledge and practices towards 2019-nCoV except respondents with socio-demographic characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage adequate preventive practice towards 2019-nCoV should be targeted towards this group.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Balsam Qubais","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rula mudhafar Al-Shahrabi","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Obasanjo Afolabi Bolarinwa","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Alex Cao","author_inst":"CSCAR, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ryan Malosh","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kelly Broen","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nina Masters","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Paul Delamater","author_inst":"Dept. of Geography, University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Matt Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Caroline Relton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Samuel Le Pape","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse, Inserm U 1193 ; Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay Villejuif, APHP Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"Rim Kallala","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse"},{"author_name":"Alice Rochard","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital de Bicetre"},{"author_name":"Celine Verstuyft","author_inst":"Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine Paris-Sud, Univ Paris-Sud, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay; INSERM U1184; Service de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique mol\u00e9culaire, Pharmacog\u00e9n\u00e9tique et H"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fortineau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Anne-Marie Roque-Afonso","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse, Inserm U 1193 ; Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay Villejuif, APHP Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"Thierry Naas","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD\/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Huang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Chengxin Zhang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robin Pearce","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Gilbert S Omenn","author_inst":"Univ of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kelly Broen","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nina Masters","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Paul Delamater","author_inst":"Dept. of Geography, University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Matt Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Caroline Relton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Samuel Le Pape","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse, Inserm U 1193 ; Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay Villejuif, APHP Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"Rim Kallala","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse"},{"author_name":"Alice Rochard","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital de Bicetre"},{"author_name":"Celine Verstuyft","author_inst":"Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine Paris-Sud, Univ Paris-Sud, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay; INSERM U1184; Service de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique mol\u00e9culaire, Pharmacog\u00e9n\u00e9tique et H"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fortineau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Anne-Marie Roque-Afonso","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse, Inserm U 1193 ; Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay Villejuif, APHP Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"Thierry Naas","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

Its variant carrying mutated Spike (S) protein D614G (SD614G) has become the most prevalent form in the current global pandemic4,5. We have identified a large panel of potential neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S6. Here, we focused on the top 20 potential NAbs for the mechanism study. Of them, the top 4 NAbs could individually neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SD614G pseudovirus efficiently. Our epitope mapping revealed that 16\/20 potent NAbs overlapped the same steric epitope. Excitingly, we found that one of these potent NAbs (58G6) exclusively bound to a linear epitope on S-RBD (termed as 58G6e), and the interaction of 58G6e and the recombinant ACE2 could be blocked by 58G6. We confirmed that 58G6e represented a key site of vulnerability on S-RBD and it could positively react with COVID-19 convalescent patients plasma. We are the first, as far as we know, to provide direct evidences of a linear epitope that can be recognized by a potent NAb against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. This study paves the way for the applications of these NAbs and the potential safe and effective vaccine design.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tingting

To identify their genetic similarity, phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequences, selected from GISAID, to the complete genomes from Turkish isolates. In addition, we focused on the variation analysis to show the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 genomes.\n\nMethodsIllumina MiSeq platform was used for sequencing the libraries. The raw reads were aligned to the known SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (v.0.7.1). The phylogenetic tree was constructer using Phylip v.3.6 with Neighbor-Joining and composite likelihood method. The variants were detected by using Genome Analysis Toolkit-HaplotypeCaller v.3.8.0 and were inspected on GenomeBrowse v2.1.2.\n\nResultsAll viral genome sequences of our isolates was located in lineage B under the different clusters such as B.1 (n=3), B.1.1 (n=28), and B.1.9 (n=16). According to the GISAID nomenclature, all our complete genomes were placed in G, GR and GH clades. Five hundred forty-nine total and 53 unique variants were detected. All 47 genomes exhibited different kinds of variants. The distinct variants consist of 274 missense, 225 synonymous, and 50 non-coding alleles.\n\nConclusionThe results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of our isolates have great similarity with all Turkish and European sequences. Further studies should be performed for better comparison of strains, after more complete genome sequences will be released. We also believe that collecting and sharing any data about SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 will be effective and may help the related studies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Murat

We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen four related coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) at two physiologically relevant temperatures (33 {degrees}C and 37 {degrees}C), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution relative to genome scale studies. This approach yielded several new insights, including unexpected virus and temperature specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and GPI anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug development efforts aimed at intercepting and treating COVID-19, and help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSFocused CRISPR screens targeting host factors in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome were performed for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses.\n\nFocused interactome CRISPR screens achieve higher resolution compared to genome-wide screens, leading to the identification of critical factors missed by the latter.\n\nParallel CRISPR screens against multiple coronaviruses uncover host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles.\n\nThe number of host proteins that interact with a viral bait protein is not proportional to the number of functional interactors.\n\nNovel SARS-CoV-2 host factors are expressed in relevant cell types in the human airway.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"H.-Heinrich Hoffmann","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA"},{"author_name":"William M.

Herein, we isolated and profiled a panel of 32 N protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) from a quick recovery coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) convalescent, who had dominant antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 N protein rather than to Spike protein. The complex structure of N protein RNA binding domain with the highest binding affinity mAb nCoV396 reveals the epitopes and antigens allosteric changes.

Here, employing large replicate sets of GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, we statistically compare atom fluctuations of the known human target proteins in both the presence and absence of different strains of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S spike glycoprotein. We identify a common interaction site between the N-terminal helices of ACE2 and the viral RBD in all strains (hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV1, and SARS-CoV-2) and a second more dynamically complex RBD interaction site involving the ACE2 amino acid sites K353, Q325, and a novel motif, AAQPFLL (386-392) in the more recent cross-species spillovers (i.e. absent in hCoV-OC43). We use computational mutagenesis to further confirm the functional relevance of these sites. We propose a \"one touch\/two touch\" model of viral evolution potentially involved in functionally facilitating binding interactions in zoonotic spillovers. We also observe these two touch sites governing RBD binding activity in simulations on hybrid models of the suspected viral progenitor, batCoV-HKU4, interacting with both the human SARS target, ACE2, and the human MERS target, CD26. Lastly, we confirm that the presence of a common hypertension drug (lisinopril) within the target site of SARS-CoV-2 bound models of ACE1 and ACE2 acts to enhance the RBD interactions at the same key sites in our proposed model. In the near future, we recommend that our comparative computational analysis identifying these key viral RBD-ACE2 binding interactions be supplemented with comparative studies of site-directed mutagenesis in order to screen for current and future coronavirus strains at high risk of zoonotic transmission to humans.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe generated structural models of the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain from recent and past betacoronavirus outbreak strains aligned to the angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 protein, the primary target protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID 19. We then statistically compared computer simulated molecular dynamics of viral bound and unbound versions of each model to identify locations where interactions with each viral strain have dampened the atom fluctuations during viral binding. We demonstrate that all known strains of betacoronavirus are strongly interactive with the N-terminal helix region of ACE2. We also identify a more complex viral interaction with three novel sites that associates with more recent and deadly SARS strains, and also a bat progenitor strain HKU4.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick X.
