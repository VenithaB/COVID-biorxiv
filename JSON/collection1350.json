SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate complex pathogenic mechanisms that underlie COVID-19 disease. Thus, understanding how viral polypeptides rewire host protein networks enables better-founded therapeutic research. In complement to existing proteomic studies, in this study we define the first proximal interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, at the whole proteome level in human cells. Applying a proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID)-based approach greatly expanded the current knowledge by detecting interactions within poorly soluble compartments, transient, and\/or of weak affinity in living cells. Our BioID study was complemented by a stringent filtering and uncovered 2,128 unique cellular targets (1,717 not previously associated with SARS-CoV-1 or 2 proteins) connected to the N- and C-ter BioID-tagged 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by a total of 5,415 (5,236 new) proximal interactions. In order to facilitate data exploitation, an innovative interactive 3D web interface was developed to allow customized analysis and exploration of the landscape of interactions (accessible at http:\/\/www.sars-cov-2-interactome.org\/). Interestingly, 342 membrane proteins including interferon and interleukin pathways factors, were associated with specific viral proteins. We uncovered ORF7a and ORF7b protein proximal partners that could be related to anosmia and ageusia symptoms. Moreover, comparing proximal interactomes in basal and infection-mimicking conditions (poly(I:C) treatment) allowed us to detect novel links with major antiviral response pathway components, such as ORF9b with MAVS and ISG20; N with PKR and TARB2; NSP2 with RIG-I and STAT1; NSP16 with PARP9-DTX3L. Altogether, our study provides an unprecedented comprehensive resource for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate host proteome remodeling and innate immune response evasion, which can inform development of targeted therapeutic strategies.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Estelle MN Laurent","author_inst":"Univ.

One strategy to discourage the fomite-mediated spread of COVID-19 is the development of materials whose surface chemistry can spontaneously inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a material used in spine fusion surgery, is one such candidate because it has been shown to inactivate several bacterial species and viral strains. This study hypothesized that contact with Si3N4 would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while mammalian cells would remain unaffected.\n\nMaterialsSARS-CoV-2 virions (2x104 PFU\/mL diluted in growth media) were exposed to 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w\/v) of an aqueous suspension of sintered Si3N4 particles for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Before exposure to the virus, cytotoxicity testing of Si3N4 alone was assessed in Vero cells at 24 and 48 hour post-exposure times. Following each exposure to Si3N4, the remaining infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay.\n\nResultsVero cell viability increased at 5% and 10% (w\/v) concentrations of Si3N4 at exposure times up to 10 minutes, and there was only minimal impact on cell health and viability up to 20% (w\/v). However, the SARS-CoV-2 titers were markedly reduced when exposed to all concentrations of Si3N4; the reduction in viral titers was between 85% - 99.6%, depending on the dose and duration of exposure.\n\nConclusionsSi3N4 was non-toxic to the Vero cells while showing strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The viricidal effect increased with increasing concentrations of Si3N4 and longer duration of exposure. Surface treatment strategies based on Si3N4 may offer novel methods to discourage SARS-CoV-2 persistence and infectivity on surfaces and discourage the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caitlin W.

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface-exposed spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents a suitable target for the induction of neutralizing antibodies upon vaccination. Small protein antigens typically induce weak immune response while particles measuring tens of nanometers are efficiently presented to B cell follicles and subsequently to follicular germinal center B cells in draining lymph nodes, where B cell proliferation and affinity maturation occurs. Here we prepared and analyzed the response to several DNA vaccines based on genetic fusions of RBD to four different scaffolding domains, namely to the foldon peptide, ferritin, lumazine synthase and {beta}-annulus peptide, presenting from 6 to 60 copies of the RBD on each particle. Scaffolding strongly augmented the immune response with production of neutralizing antibodies and T cell response including cytotoxic lymphocytes in mice upon immunization with DNA plasmids. The most potent response was observed for the 24-residue {beta}-annulus peptide scaffold that forms large soluble assemblies, that has the advantage of low immunogenicity in comparison to larger scaffolds. Our results support the advancement of this vaccine platform towards clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dusko Lainscek","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Tina Fink","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Vida Forstneric","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Iva Hafner-Bratkovic","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Sara Orehek","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Ziga Strmsek","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Mateja Mancek Keber","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Peter Pecan","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Hana Esih","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Spela Malensek","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Jana Aupic","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Petra Dekleva","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Tjasa Plaper","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Sara Vidmar","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Lucija Kadunc","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Mojca Bencina","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Florence Pojer","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Kelvin Lau","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"David Hacker","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Correia","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"David Peterhoff","author_inst":"University Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralf Wagner","author_inst":"University Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Roman Jerala","author_inst":"National institute of chemistry"},{"author_name":"Georgios A Pavlopoulos","author_inst":"Institute for Fundamental Biomedical Research, BSRC \"Alexander Fleming\", 34 Fleming Street, 16672, Vari, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Van Der Werf","author_inst":"Departement de Virologie, Unite de Genetique Moleculaire des Virus a ARN (GMVR), Institut Pasteur, UMR3569, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Fournier","author_inst":"Univ.

The HK-13 and HK-95 isolates showed distinct pathogenicity in hamsters, with higher virus titers and more severe pathological changes in the lungs observed compared to other isolates. HK-95 contains a D614G substitution in the spike protein and demonstrated higher viral gene expression and transmission efficiency in hamsters.

This approach uncovered a virus-host topology network comprising 3566 proximity interactions amongst 1010 host proteins, highlighting extensive virus protein crosstalk with: (i) host protein folding and modification machinery; (ii) membrane-bound vesicles and organelles, and; (iii) lipid trafficking pathways and ER-organelle membrane contact sites. The design and implementation of sensitive mass spectrometric approaches for the analysis of complex biological samples is also important for both clinical and basic research proteomics focused on the study of COVID-19. To this end, we conducted a mass spectrometry-based characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and infected cell lysates, identifying 189 unique high-confidence virus tryptic peptides derived from 17 different virus proteins, to create a high quality resource for use in targeted proteomics approaches.

Prior clinical studies have identified adverse events1,2, and remdesivir has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial RNA polymerase in biochemical experiments7, yet little is known about the specific genetic pathways involved in cellular remdesivir metabolism and cytotoxicity. Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening and RNA sequencing, we show that remdesivir treatment leads to a repression of mitochondrial respiratory activity, and we identify five genes whose loss significantly reduces remdesivir cytotoxicity. In particular, we show that loss of the mitochondrial nucleoside transporter SLC29A3 mitigates remdesivir toxicity without a commensurate decrease in SARS-CoV-2 antiviral potency and that the mitochondrial adenylate kinase AK2 is a remdesivir kinase required for remdesivir efficacy and toxicity. This work elucidates the cellular mechanisms of remdesivir metabolism and provides a candidate gene target to reduce remdesivir cytotoxicity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lin Lin","author_inst":"Hubrecht Institute"},{"author_name":"Grace Yeo","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Callie J Donahue","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Robert A Davey","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Vinitha Macwan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Cancer Centre"},{"author_name":"Dae-Kyun Kim","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer J Knapp","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Frederick P.

To learn more about COVID-19 pathophysiology we performed secondary analyses of transcriptomic data from two in vitro (Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells) and one in vivo (Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice) models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found 1467 conserved differentially expressed host genes (differentially expressed in at least two of the three model system transcriptomes compared) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To find potential genetic factors associated with COVID-19, we analyzed these conserved differentially expressed genes using known human genotype-phenotype associations. Genome-wide association study enrichment analysis showed evidence of enrichment for GWA loci associated with platelet functions, blood pressure, body mass index, respiratory functions, and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, among others. Since human protein complexes are known to be directly related to viral infection, we combined and analyzed the conserved transcriptomic signature with SARS-CoV-2-host protein-protein interaction data and found more than 150 gene clusters. Of these, 29 clusters (with 5 or more genes in each cluster) had at least one gene encoding protein that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These clusters were enriched for different cell types in lung including epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell types suggesting their pathophysiological relevancy to COVID-19. Finally, pathway analysis on the conserved differentially expressed genes and gene clusters showed alterations in several pathways and biological processes that could enable in understanding or hypothesizing molecular signatures inducing pathophysiological changes, risks, or sequelae of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anil G Jegga","author_inst":"Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Grace Yeo","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Callie J Donahue","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Robert A Davey","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Vinitha Macwan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Cancer Centre"},{"author_name":"Dae-Kyun Kim","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer J Knapp","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Frederick P.

We used directed message passing neural network to first build a broad-spectrum anti-beta-coronavirus compound prediction model, which gave satisfactory predictions on newly reported active compounds against SARS-CoV-2. Then we applied transfer learning to fine-tune the model with the recently reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. The fine-tuned model was applied to screen a large compound library with 4.9 million drug-like molecules from ZINC15 database and recommended a list of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds for further experimental testing. As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally tested 7 high-scored compounds that also demonstrated good binding strength in docking study against the 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 and found one novel compound that inhibited the enzyme with an IC50 of 37.0 M.

Ferritin is an attractive nanoparticle platform for production of vaccines and ferritin-based vaccines have been investigated in humans in two separate clinical trials. We confirmed proper folding and antigenicity of spike on the surface of ferritin by cryo-EM and binding to conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. After a single immunization of mice with either of the two spike ferritin particles, a lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay revealed mean neutralizing antibody titers at least 2-fold greater than those in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a single dose of S{Delta}C-Fer elicited significantly higher neutralizing responses as compared to immunization with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) monomer or spike ectodomain trimer alone. After a second dose, mice immunized with S{Delta}C-Fer exhibited higher neutralizing titers than all other groups. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multivalent presentation of SARS-CoV-2 spike on ferritin can notably enhance elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, thus constituting a viable strategy for single-dose vaccination against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abigail E.

One of the obstacles for the antiviral development is the requirement of biocontainment because infectious SARS-CoV-2 must be handled in a biosafety level-3 laboratory. Replicon, a non-infectious self-replicative viral RNA, could be a safe and effective tool for antiviral screening; however, SARS-CoV-2 replicon has not been reported yet. Herein, we generated a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 replicon. Eight fragments covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome except S, E, and M genes were amplified with HiBiT-tag sequence by PCR. The amplicons were ligated and in vitro transcribed to RNA. The cells electroporated with the replicon RNA showed more than 3,000 times higher luminescence than MOCK control cells at 24 hours post-electroporation, indicating robust viral translation and RNA replication. The replication was drastically inhibited by remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. The IC50 of remdesivir in this study was 0.29 M, generally consistent to the IC50 obtained using infectious SARS-CoV-2 in a previous study (0.77 M). Taken together, this system could be applied to the safe and effective antiviral screening without using infectious SARS-CoV-2. Because this is a transient replicon, further improvement including the establishment of stable cell line must be achieved.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tomohiro Kotaki","author_inst":"Kobe University"},{"author_name":"Xuping Xie","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Masanori Kameoka","author_inst":"Kobe University"},{"author_name":"Payton A.

An average of 13.7% and 13.0% of plasmablast-derived IgG MAbs were reactive with virus spike glycoprotein or nucleocapsid, respectively. Of thirty-two antibodies specific for the spike glycoprotein, ten recognised the receptor-binding domain (RBD), thirteen were specific for non-RBD epitopes on the S1 subunit, and nine recognised the S2 subunit. A subset of anti-spike antibodies (10 of 32) cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested, five targeted the non-RBD S1, and five targeted the S2 subunit. Of the plasmablast-derived MAbs reacting with nucleocapsid, over half of them (19 of 35) cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested. The cross-reactive plasmablast-derived antibodies harboured extensive somatic mutations, indicative of an expansion of memory B cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified 14 of 32 anti-spike MAbs that neutralised SARS-CoV-2 in independent assays at [&le;] 133 nM (20 g\/ml) (five of 10 anti-RBD, three of 13 anti-non-RBD S1 subunit, six of nine anti-S2 subunit). Six of 10 anti-RBD MAbs showed evidence of blockade of ACE2 binding to RBD, and five of six of these were neutralising. Non-competing pairs of neutralising antibodies were identified, which offer potential templates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tiong Tan","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting-Hua Chen","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chung-Guei Huang","author_inst":"Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memori"},{"author_name":"Ruth Harvey","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Saira Hussain","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Pin Chen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Adam Harding","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Javier Gilbert-Jaramillo","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Xu Liu","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Knight","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa Schimanski","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memori"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chun Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chien-Yu Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Shu-Hsing Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yhu-Chering Huang","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Tzou-Yien Lin","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Rolle Rahikainen","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark Howarth","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Jia-Tsrong Jan","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Che Ma","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

The polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultured at an airway-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) is an in vitro model mimicking the in vivo human mucociliary airway epithelium and supports the replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies only characterized short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an interval of approximately 7-10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors. We also identified that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect HAE from the basolateral side, and the dominant SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial cells are ciliated cells and goblet cells, whereas virus replication in basal cells and club cells was not detectable. Notably, virus infection immediately damaged the HAE, which is demonstrated by dispersed Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression without clear tight junctions and partial loss of cilia. Importantly, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 productive infection of HAE requires a high viral load of 2.5 x 105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of a high viral load and that epithelial renewal initiates and maintains a recurrent infection of HAE with SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siyuan Hao","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kang Ning","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Cagla Aksu Kuz","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kai Vorhies","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Ziying Yan","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Jianming Qiu","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Pin Chen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Adam Harding","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Javier Gilbert-Jaramillo","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Xu Liu","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Knight","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa Schimanski","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memori"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chun Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chien-Yu Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Shu-Hsing Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yhu-Chering Huang","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Tzou-Yien Lin","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Rolle Rahikainen","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark Howarth","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Jia-Tsrong Jan","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Che Ma","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

The only SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, for emergency use, is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. PF-00835231 is a pre-clinical lead compound with an alternate target, the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231 and remdesivir in A549+ACE2 cells, using isolates of two major SARS-CoV-2 clades. PF-00835231 is antiviral for both clades, and, in this assay, statistically more potent than remdesivir. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps and validates PF-00835231s time of action. Both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective antiviral for SARS-CoV-2, addresses concerns from non-human in vitro models, and supports further studies with this compound.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maren de Vries","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adil Mohamed","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachel Anne Prescott","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana Valero-Jimenez","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ludovic Desvignes","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Claire Steppan","author_inst":"Pfizer Discovery Sciences"},{"author_name":"Annaliesa Anderson","author_inst":"Pfizer Vaccine Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Joseph Binder","author_inst":"Pfizer Oncology Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Meike Dittmann","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xu Liu","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Knight","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa Schimanski","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memori"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chun Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chien-Yu Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Shu-Hsing Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yhu-Chering Huang","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Tzou-Yien Lin","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Rolle Rahikainen","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark Howarth","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Jia-Tsrong Jan","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Che Ma","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

Here we examine the properties of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations at the S protein cleavage site that undergo inefficient proteolytic cleavage. Virus variants with S gene mutations generated smaller plaques and exhibited a more limited range of cell tropism compared to the wild-type strain. These alterations were shown to result from their inability to utilize the entry pathway involving direct fusion mediated by the host type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2. Notably, viruses with S gene mutations emerged rapidly and became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in TMPRSS2-deficient cells including Vero cells.

In this study, we established a SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including a SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Moreover, based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris (CHPV) and a compound, suramin, displayed potent inhibitory effects on both wild type and mutant (G614) SCoV-2 SP pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs)-mediated infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for CHPV and suramin on SCoV-2-SP-PVs are 30, and 40 g\/ml, respectively. To define the mechanisms of their actions, we demonstrated that both CHPV and suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2-SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, our results also showed that CHPV or suramin can efficiently reduce levels of cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19\/Canada\/ON-VIDO-01\/2020) infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the combination of CHPV\/suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs. Overall, this study provides evidence that CHPV and suramin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhujun Ao","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Mable Chan","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Maggie Jing Ouyang","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Titus Abiola Olukitibi","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Mona Mahmoudi","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Darwyn Kobasa","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Yao","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Sawa","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Meike Dittmann","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xu Liu","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Knight","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa Schimanski","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memori"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chun Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chien-Yu Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Shu-Hsing Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, and Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yhu-Chering Huang","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Tzou-Yien Lin","author_inst":"Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Rolle Rahikainen","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark Howarth","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU, UK"},{"author_name":"Jia-Tsrong Jan","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Che Ma","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

It has affected the whole world including Odisha, a state in eastern India. Many people migrated in the state from different countries as well as states during this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As per the protocol laid by ICMR and Health & Family welfare of India, all the suspected cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to analyze the RNA binding domain (RBD) sequence of spike protein from the isolates collected from the throat swab samples of COVID-19 positive cases and further to assess the RBD affinity with ACE2 of different species including human.\n\nWhole genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive patients was performed using ARTIC amplicon based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the Spike and RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor of five different species was also analysed.\n\nExcept three isolates, spike region of 32 isolates showed one\/multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison to the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutation at 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C) in the RBD of spike protein was identified which depicted a stronger binding affinity with human ACE2 receptor compared to the wild type RBD. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates are capable of binding to ACE2 of human, bat, hamster and pangolin.\n\nAs mutated RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. The study shows that RBDs of all the studied isolates have binding affinity for all the five species, which suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pujarini Dash","author_inst":"ICMR-RMRC, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Jyotirmayee Turuk","author_inst":"ICMR-RMRC, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Santosh Ku.

In COVID-19, the infection and immune hyperactivation causes accumulation of inflammatory immune cells, blood clots, and protein aggregates in lung fluid, increased lung alveolar wall thickness, and upregulation of serum cytokine levels. A serum protein called serum amyloid P (SAP) has a calming effect on the innate immune system and shows efficacy as a therapeutic for fibrosis in animal models and clinical trials. In this report, we show that aspiration of the GU-rich ssRNA oligonucleotide ORN06 into mouse lungs induces all of the above COVID-19-like symptoms. Men tend to have more severe COVID-19 symptoms than women, and in the aspirated ORN06 model, male mice tended to have more severe symptoms than female mice. Intraperitoneal injections of SAP starting from day 1 post ORN06 aspiration attenuated the ORN06-induced increase in the number of inflammatory cells and formation of clot-like aggregates in the mouse lung fluid, reduced ORN06-increased alveolar wall thickness and accumulation of exudates in the alveolar airspace, and attenuated an ORN06-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in serum.

Although vaccines against the virus are under development, the antigen epitopes on the virus and their immunogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we simulated the three-dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with high performance computer, predicted the B cell epitopes on spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches, and then validated the epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induced antibody production, six of which were immunodominant epitopes in patients identified via the binding of epitopes with the sera from domestic and imported COVID-19 patients, and 23 were conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We also found that the immunodominant epitopes of domestic SARS-CoV-2 were different from that of the imported, which may be caused by the mutations on S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we validated that eight epitopes on S protein elicited neutralizing antibodies that blocked the cell entry of both D614 and G614 pseudo-virus of SARS-CoV-2, three and nine epitopes induced D614 or G614 neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Our present study shed light on the immunodominance, neutralization, and conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 which are potently used for the diagnosis, virus classification and the vaccine design tackling inefficiency, virus mutation and different species of coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xi-xiu Xie","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Bin Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ting-rui Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guang-wen Yang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Mei Ji","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Cui-ping Lv","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jian Xue","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Er-hei Dai","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xi-ming Fu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Dong-qun Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

A potent orally bioavailable antiviral for early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed. We focused on making simple orally bioavailable lipid analogs of Remdesivir nucleoside (RVn, GS-441524) that are processed to RVn-monophosphate, the precursor of the active RVn-triphosphate, by a single step intracellular cleavage.

Since there is no therapy available that is proven as fully protective against COVID-19, a vaccine to protect against deadly COVID-19 is urgently needed. Nucleocapsid protein (N protein), is one of the most abundant proteins in coronaviruses and is a potential target for both vaccine development and point of care diagnostics. The variable mass of N protein (45 to 60 kDa), suggests the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and it is critical to clearly define these PTMs to gain the structural understanding necessary for further vaccine research. There have been several reports suggesting that the N protein is phosphorylated but lacks glycosylation. Our comprehensive glycomics and glycoproteomics experiments confirm that the N protein is highly O-glycosylated and also contains significant levels of N-glycosylation. We were able to confirm the presence of O-glycans on seven sites with substantial glycan occupancy, in addition to less abundant O-glycans on four sites. We also detected N-glycans on two out of five potential N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, we were able to confirm one phosphorylation site. Recent studies have indicated that the N protein can serve as an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and a major immunogen by priming protective immune responses. Thus, detailed structural characterization of the N protein may provide useful insights for understanding the roles of glycosylation on viral pathogenesis and also in vaccine design and development.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nitin T Supekar","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia,"},{"author_name":"Asif Shajahan","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Anne Gleinich","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Daniel Rouhani","author_inst":"The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Christian Heiss","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Parastoo Azadi","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Geert van Amerongen","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Leon de Waal","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Koert J Stittelaar","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Judith van den Brand","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

As spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in receptor binding and membrane fusion inside the host, it could be a suitable target for designing of an epitope-based vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and thus has a property to mutate. So, a conserved peptide region of spike glycoprotein was used for predicting suitable B cell and T cell epitopes. 4 T cell epitopes were selected based on stability, antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity. Further, MHC-I were found from the immune database that could best interact with the selected epitopes. Population coverage analysis was also done to check the presence of identified MHC-I, in the human population of the affected countries. The T cell epitope that binds with the respective MHC-I with highest affinity was chosen. Molecular dynamic simulation results show that the epitope is well selected. This is an in-silico based study that predicts a novel T cell epitope from the conserved spike glycoprotein that could act as a target for designing of the epitope-based vaccine. Further, B cell epitopes have also been found but the main work focuses on T cell epitope as the immunity generated by it is long lasting as compared to B cell epitope.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vidhu Agarwal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Akhilesh Tiwari","author_inst":"Indian Insitute of Information Technology, Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Pritish Kumar Varadwaj","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Daniel Rouhani","author_inst":"The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Christian Heiss","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Parastoo Azadi","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Geert van Amerongen","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Leon de Waal","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Koert J Stittelaar","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Judith van den Brand","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

Ongoing studies using CRISIS include international studies of COVID-related ill health conducted during different phases of the pandemic and follow-up studies of cohorts characterized before the COVID pandemic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aki Nikolaidis","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Diana Paksarian","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lindsay Alexander","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob DeRosa","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Dunn","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Dylan M Nielson","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Irene Droney","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Minji Kang","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Ioanna Douka","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Bromet","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Michael P Milham","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

ORF8 is a rapidly evolving accessory protein that has been proposed to interfere with immune responses. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 was determined at 2.04 [A] resolution by x-ray crystallography. The structure reveals a ~60 residue core similar to SARS-CoV ORF7a with the addition of two dimerization interfaces unique to SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. A covalent disulfide-linked dimer is formed through an N-terminal sequence specific to SARS-CoV-2, while a separate non-covalent interface is formed by another SARS-CoV-2-specific sequence, 73YIDI76. Together the presence of these interfaces shows how SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 can form unique large-scale assemblies not possible for SARS-CoV, potentially mediating unique immune suppression and evasion activities.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas G Flower","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Cosmo Z Buffalo","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Richard M Hooy","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Marc Allaire","author_inst":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Xuefeng Ren","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"James H Hurley","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Irene Droney","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Minji Kang","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Ioanna Douka","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Bromet","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Michael P Milham","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

Here, we describe an analysis procedure where genome composition and its variables are related, through the genetic code, to molecular mechanisms based on understanding of RNA replication and its feedback loop from mutation to viral proteome sequence fraternity including effective sites on replicase-transcriptase complex. Our analysis starts with primary sequence information and identity-based phylogeny based on 22,051 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluation of sequence variation patterns as mutation spectrum and its 12 permutations among organized clades tailored to two key mechanisms: strand-biased and function-associated mutations. Our findings include: (1) The most dominant mutation is C-to-U permutation whose abundant second-codon-position counts alter amino acid composition toward higher molecular weight and lower hydrophobicity albeit assumed most slightly deleterious. (2) The second abundance group includes: three negative-strand mutations U-to-C, A-to-G, G-to-A and a positive-strand mutation G-to-U generated through an identical mechanism as C-to-U. (3) A clade-associated and biased mutation trend is found attributable to elevated level of the negative-sense strand synthesis. (4) Within-clade permutation variation is very informative for associating non-synonymous mutations and viral proteome changes. These findings demand a bioinformatics platform where emerging mutations are mapped on to mostly subtle but fast-adjusting viral proteomes and transcriptomes to provide biological and clinical information after logical convergence for effective pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications. Such thoughts and actions are in desperate need, especially in the middle of the War against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xufei Teng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qianpeng Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhao Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuansheng Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guangyi Niu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jingfa Xiao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jun Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhang Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shuhui Song","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Bromet","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Michael P Milham","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.

About 39% of these were associated with a religious mass gathering event held in Kuala Lumpur between February 27 and March 1, 2020, which drove community transmission during Malaysias main wave. We analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Malaysia to understand the molecular epidemiology.\n\nMethodsWe obtained whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 58 COVID-19 patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and performed phylogenetic analyses on these and a further 50 Malaysian sequences available in the GISAID database. Malaysian lineage B.6 sequences were further analysed with all available worldwide lineage B.6 sequences.\n\nResultsNine different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.36, B.2, B.3 and B.6) were detected in Malaysia. The B.6 lineage was first reported a week after the mass gathering and became predominant (63%) despite being relatively rare (1.4%) among available global sequences. Increases in reported cases and community-acquired B.6 lineage strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 lineages were mainly associated with travel and showed limited onward transmission. There were also temporally-correlated increases in B.6 sequences in other Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia, linked to participants returning from this event. We also report the presence of a nsp3-C6310A substitution found in 40.5% of global B.6 sequences which has associated with reduced sensitivity in a commercial assay.\n\nConclusionLineage B.6 became the predominant cause of community transmission in Malaysia after likely introduction during a religious mass gathering. This event also contributed to spikes of lineage B.6 in other countries in the region.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia was driven mainly by transmission following a religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur at the end of February. To study the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Malaysia, we analysed 50 available and 58 newly-generated Malaysian whole genome virus sequences. We found that lineage B.6, rare (1.4%) globally, first appeared after the mass gathering and became the most predominant (62.9%) in Malaysia. Increases in COVID-19 cases and locally-acquired B.6 strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 viruses were mainly associated with travel and showed limited spread. Increases in B.6 viruses in Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia were linked to participants returning from this mass gathering. Altogether, 95.3% of global B.6 sequences originated in Asia or Australia. We also report a mutation in the virus nsP3 gene found in 40.5% of global B.6 sequences and associated with reduced detection by a commercial diagnostic test. In conclusion, the religious mass gathering in Kuala Lumpur was associated with the main wave of COVID-19 cases of predominantly B.6 lineage in Malaysia, and subsequent spread of B.6 viruses regionally. Genome sequence data provides valuable insight into virus spread and is important for monitoring continued accuracy of diagnostic kits.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yoong Min Chong","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"I-Ching Sam","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Chong","author_inst":"University of Malaya Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Maria Kahar Bador","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sasheela Ponnampalavanar","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sharifah  Faridah Syed Omar","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adeeba Kamarulzaman","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vijayan Munusamy","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chee Kuan Wong","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fadhil Hadi Jamaluddin","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yoke Fun Chan","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rodney Daniels","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; Centre for Translational Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michel Salzet","author_inst":"Univ.
