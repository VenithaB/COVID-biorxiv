The ACE2 gene, identified as the SARS-CoV2 receptor, has been shown to facilitate the viral invasion and people with higher ACE2 expression generally are more severely affected2, 3. As there is a lot of variability in ACE2 expression between individuals we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation profiles could be (one of) the confounding factors explaining this variability. Here we show that epigenetic profiling of host tissue, especially in the ACE2 promoter region and its homologue ACE1, may be important risk factors for COVID-19. Our results propose that variable methylation can explain (part of) the differential susceptibility, symptom severity and death rate for COVID-19. Our findings are a promising starting point to further evaluate the potential of ACE1\/2 methylation and other candidates as a predictor for clinical outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sandra Steyaert","author_inst":"doc.ai Inc. 636 Waverley Street, Palo Alto, CA 94301"},{"author_name":"Geert Trooskens","author_inst":"doc.ai Inc. 636 Waverley Street, Palo Alto, CA 94301"},{"author_name":"Joris R Delanghe","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Van Criekinge","author_inst":"Biobix, Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.250076","rel_title":"In Silico Design of siRNAs Targeting Existing and Future Respiratory Viruses with VirusSi","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.250076","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed global inadequacies in therapeutic options against both the COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus and other newly emerged respiratory viruses. In this study, we present the VirusSi computational pipeline, which facilitates the rational design of siRNAs to target existing and future respiratory viruses. Mode A of VirusSi designs siRNAs against an existing virus, incorporating considerations on siRNA properties, off-target effects, viral RNA structure and viral mutations. It designs multiple siRNAs out of which the top candidate targets >99% of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the combination of the top four siRNAs is predicted to target all SARS-CoV-2 strains. Additionally, we develop Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (GAR) and Similarity-weighted Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (SGAR) to support the Mode B of VirusSi, which pre-designs siRNAs against future emerging viruses based on existing viral sequences. Time-simulations using known coronavirus genomes as early as 10 years prior to the COVID-19 outbreak show that at least three SARS-CoV-2-targeting siRNAs are among the top 30 pre-designed siRNAs. Before-the-outbreak pre-design is also possible against the MERS-CoV virus and the 2009-H1N1 swine flu virus. Our data support the feasibility of pre-designing anti-viral siRNA therapeutics prior to viral outbreaks. We propose the development of a collection of pre-designed, safety-tested, and off-the-shelf siRNAs that could accelerate responses toward future viral diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dingyao Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jun Lu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Joris R Delanghe","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Van Criekinge","author_inst":"Biobix, Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.251496","rel_title":"Rational Design of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins To Increase Immunogenicity By T Cell Epitope Engineering","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.251496","rel_abs":"The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of confirmed cases and thousands of deaths globally. Extensive efforts and progress have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A primary target of these vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many studies utilized structural vaccinology techniques to either stabilize the protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In this study, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface conformation and B cell epitopes of the S protein. We then evaluated the mutated S protein candidates based on predicted MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes as well as the epitopes similarity to human peptides. The presented strategy aims to improve the S proteins immunogenicity and antigenicity by inducing stronger CD4 T cell response while maintaining the proteins native structure and function. The top EvoDesign S protein candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out of 32 MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, in which two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. This newly designed S protein also introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes and showed high structural similarity to its native conformation. The proposed structural vaccinology method provides an avenue to rationally design the antigens structure with increased immunogenicity, which could be applied to the rational design of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edison Ong","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Huang","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA"},{"author_name":"Robin Pearce","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yongqun He","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.250480","rel_title":"Discovery of Clioquinol and Analogues as Novel Inhibitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection, ACE2 and ACE2 - Spike Protein Interaction In Vitro","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.250480","rel_abs":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as an ongoing global pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in respiratory epithelial cells motivating the development of alternative and rapidly scalable vaccine inducing mucosal protective and long-lasting immunity. We have previously developed an immunologically optimized multi-neoepitopes-based peptide vaccine platform which has already demonstrated tolerance and efficacy in hundreds of lung cancer patients. Here, we present a multi-target CD8 T cell peptide COVID-19 vaccine design targeting several structural (S, M, N) and non-structural (NSPs) SARS-CoV-2 proteins with selected epitopes in conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that a single subcutaneous injection of a serie of epitopes induces a robust immunogenicity in-vivo as measured by IFN{gamma} ELIspot. Upon tetramer characterization we found that this serie of epitopes induces a strong proportion of virus-specific CD8 T cells expressing CD103, CD44, CXCR3 and CD49a, the specific phenotype of tissue-resident memory T lymphocytes (Trm). Finally, we observed broad cellular responses, as characterized by IFN{gamma} production, upon restimulation with structural and non-structural protein-derived epitopes using blood T cells isolated from convalescent asymptomatic, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. These data provide insights for further development of a second generation of COVID-19 vaccine focused on inducing lasting Th1-biased memory CD8 T cell sentinels protection using immunodominant epitopes naturally observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution.\n\nStatement of SignificanceHumoral and cellular adaptive immunity are different and complementary immune defenses engaged by the body to clear viral infection. While neutralizing antibodies have the capacity to block virus binding to its entry receptor expressed on human cells, memory T lymphocytes have the capacity to eliminate infected cells and are required for viral clearance. However, viruses evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (phenomenon named  antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral peptides from any viral proteins presented by virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting several proteins and conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. We designed a multi-target T cell-based vaccine containing epitope regions optimized for CD8+ T cell stimulation that would drive long-lasting cellular immunity with high specificity, avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and antibody-induced macrophages hyperinflammation that could be observed in subjects with severe COVID-19. Our in-vivo results showed that a single injection of selected CD8 T cell epitopes induces memory viral-specific T-cell responses with a phenotype of tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm). Trm has attracted a growing interest for developing vaccination strategies since they act as immune sentinels in barrier tissue such as the respiratory tract and the lung. Because of their localization in tissues, they are able to immediately recognize infected cells and, because of their memory phenotypes, they rapidly respond to viral infection by orchestrating local protective immune responses to eliminate pathogens. Lastly, such multiepitope-based vaccination platform uses robust and well-validated synthetic peptide production technologies that can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vanessa Gauttier","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Aurore Morello","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Girault","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Caroline Mary","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Lyssia Belarif","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Arianne Desselle","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Wilhelm","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Thomas Bourquard","author_inst":"MabSilico"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Pengam","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Geraldine Teppaz","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Virginie Thepenier","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Kevin Biteau","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Estelle De Barbeyrac","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Delphine Kiepferle","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Berangere Vasseur","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Francois-Xavier Le Flem","author_inst":"Bataillon de Marins Pompiers de Marseille (BMPM)"},{"author_name":"Didier Debieuvre","author_inst":"groupe hospitalier regional Mulhouse-Sud Alsace (GHRMSA)"},{"author_name":"Dominique Costantini","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Poirier","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.249433","rel_title":"Ex vivo detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells: rapid induction, prolonged contraction, and formation of functional memory","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.249433","rel_abs":"CD8+ T cells are critical for the elimination and long-lasting protection of many viral infections, but their role in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unclear. Emerging data indicates that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are detectable in the majority of individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, optimal virus-specific epitopes, the role of pre-existing heterologous immunity as well as their kinetics and differentiation program during disease control have not been defined in detail. Here, we show that both pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, our results can be summarized as follows: First, immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes are targeted in the majority of individuals with convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, MHC class I tetramer analyses revealed the emergence of phenotypically diverse and functionally competent pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells that showed similar characteristics compared to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells. Third, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are more robustly detectable than antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein. This was confirmed in a longitudinal analysis of acute-resolving infection that demonstrated rapid induction of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells within a week followed by a prolonged contraction phase that outlasted the waning humoral immune response indicating that CD8+ T-cell responses might serve as a more precise correlate of antiviral immunity than antibody measurements after convalescence. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the fine specificity, heterogeneity, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells, potentially informing the rational development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isabel Schulien","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Janine Kemming","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Valerie Oberhardt","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Katharina Wild","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Lea M.

Potential drugs identified for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection include chloroquine (CQ), its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and the anesthetic propofol. Their mechanism of action in SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. Recently, anesthetics, both general and local, were shown to disrupt ordered lipid domains. These same lipid domains recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point and their disruption by cholesterol depletion decreases ACE2 recruitment and viral entry.\n\nMethodsViral entry was determined using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (SARS2-PV) and a luciferase reporter gene expressed by the virus after treatment of the cells with 50 M propofol, tetracaine, HCQ, and erythromycin. HCQ disruption of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) domains, and ACE2 receptor at nanoscale distances was monitored by direct stochastic reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then labeled with either fluorescent cholera toxin B (CTxB) or antibody and then fixed again prior to imaging. Cluster analysis of dSTORM images was used to determine size and number and cross pair correlation was used to determine trafficking of endogenously expressed ACE2 in and out of lipid domains.\n\nResultsPropofol, tetracaine, and HCQ inhibit SARS2-PV viral entry. HCQ directly perturbs both GM1 lipid rafts and PIP2 domains. GM1 rafts increased in size and number similar to anesthetic disruption of lipid rafts; PIP2 domains decreased in size and number. HCQ blocked both GM1 and PIP2 domains ability to attract and cluster ACE2.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts GM1 lipid rafts similar to propofol and other local or general anesthetics. Furthermore, we conclude disruption of GM1 raft function, and not the concentration of GM1 raft molecules, governs the antiviral properties of HCQ.

However, an important question arises about the strategies of release of isolated persons to avoid overloaded hospitals and increased deaths. Sao Paulo State (Brazil) implemented the isolation of the population in non- essential activities on March 24, and the progressive flexibilization considering the characteristics of each location (release of the isolated population) initiated on June 15. A mathematical model based on the natural history of covid-19 was applied to describe the epidemiological scenario with isolation in Sao Paulo State, and assess the impact of release on the covid-19 epidemic. Using data collected from Sao Paulo State, we estimated the model parameters to obtain the curves of the epidemic, the number of deaths, and the clinical evolution of covid-19. The epidemic under isolation was the framework to evaluate the strategies of the release, that is, how these curves are changed with the release of isolated persons. We evaluated three strategies of release. First two strategies considered four releases in the isolated population in four equal proportions, but successive releases elapsed by 14 and 21 days. In each strategy the beginning of the release was on June 29 and July 13, when the effective reproduction number Ref was evaluated. The third strategy aimed at the protection of the elder subpopulation. We observed that the delay to begin the release and the increased elapse between successive releases resulted in a better scenario by decreasing severe covid-19 cases and, consequently, to avoid overloaded hospitals. We also observed that the release delayed to achieve lower values for Ref and infectious persons retarded in several months the quick increasing phase of the forthcoming epidemic. However, this epidemic can be flattened or even suppressed by isolation of infectious persons by mass testing and\/or by rigid adoption of protective measures and social distancing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyun Mo Yang","author_inst":"Unicamp"},{"author_name":"Luis Pedro Pedro Lombardi Junior","author_inst":"State University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Ariana Campos Yang","author_inst":"General Hospital of the Medicine School of University of S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fabio Fernandes Morato Castro","author_inst":"General Hospital of the Medicine School of University of S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Lea M.

Design Retrospective observational study, analysing routinely collected clinical data from CPME reports in a rapid response to the pandemic lockdown. Setting Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, which provides all routine CPME for Birmingham, England, population 1.1 million including 288,000 children. Participants Children aged under 18 years attending CPME during an 18 week period from late February to late June during the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Main Outcome Measures Numbers of referrals, source of disclosure and outcomes from CPME Results There were 78 CPME referrals in 2018, 75 in 2019 and 47 in 2020, this was a 39.7% (95%CI 12.4-59.0) reduction in referrals from 2018 to 2020, and a 37.3% (95%CI 8.6-57.4) reduction from 2019 to 2020. There were fewer CPME referrals initiated by school staff in 2020, 12(26%) compared to 36 (47%) and 38 (52%) in 2018 and 2019 respectively. In all years 75.9% of children were known to social care prior to CPME, and 94% of CPME concluded that there were significant safeguarding concerns. Conclusions School closure due to covid-19 may have harmed children as child abuse has remained hidden. There needs to be either mandatory attendance at schools in future or viable alternatives found. There may be a significant increase in safeguarding referrals when schools fully re-open as children disclose the abuse they have experienced at home.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joanna Garstang","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare Trust"},{"author_name":"Geoff Debelle","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Indu Anand","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jane Armstrong","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emily Botcher","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Helen Chaplin","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nutmeg Hallett","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Clare Morgans","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Price","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ern Ern Henna Tan","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emily Tudor","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Julie Taylor","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Dominik Bettinger","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Oezlem Sogukpinar","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Siegbert Rieg","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Marcus Panning","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniela Huzly","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Schwemmle","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Georg Kochs","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Cornelius F.

However, we know little about the practical relevance of these challenges for Research Ethics Committees (RECs). Methods: We conducted a qualitative survey across all 52 German RECs on the challenges and potential solutions with reviewing proposals for COVID-19 studies. We de-identified the answers and applied thematic text analysis for the extraction and synthesis of challenges and potential solutions that we grouped under established principles for clinical research ethics. Results: We received an overall response rate of 42%. The 22 responding RECs reported that they had assessed a total of 441 study proposals on COVID-19 until 21 April 2020. For the review of these proposals the RECs indicated a broad spectrum of challenges regarding i) social value (e.g. lack of coordination), ii) scientific validity (e.g. provisional study planning), iii) favourable risk-benefit ratio (e.g. difficult benefit assessment), iv) informed consent (e.g. strict isolation measures), v) independent review (e.g. lack of time), vi) fair selection of trial participants (e.g. inclusion of vulnerable groups), and vii) respect for study participants (e.g. data security). Mentioned solutions ranged from improved local\/national coordination, over guidance on modified consent procedures, to priority setting across clinical studies. Conclusions: RECs are facing a broad spectrum of pressing challenges in reviewing COVID-19 studies. Some challenges for consent procedures are well known from research in intensive care settings but are further aggravated by infection measures. Other challenges such as reviewing several clinical studies at the same time that potentially compete for the recruitment of in-house COVID-19 patients are unique to the current situation. For some of the challenges the proposed solutions in our survey could relatively easy be translated into practice. Others need further conceptual and empirical research. Our findings together with the increasing body of literature on COVID-19 research ethics, and further stakeholder engagement should inform the development of hands-on guidance for researchers, funders, RECs, and further oversight bodies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alice Faust","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin \/ BIH Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Anna Sierawska","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin \/ BIH Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Katharina Krueger","author_inst":"Association of Medical Ethics Committees in Germany (AKEK, Arbeitskreis der Medizinischen Ethik-Kommissionen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland e.V.), Berlin"},{"author_name":"Anne Wisgalla","author_inst":"Association of Medical Ethics Committees in Germany (AKEK, Arbeitskreis der Medizinischen Ethik-Kommissionen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland e.V.), Berlin"},{"author_name":"Joerg Hasford","author_inst":"Association of Medical Ethics Committees in Germany (AKEK, Arbeitskreis der Medizinischen Ethik-Kommissionen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland e.V.), Berlin; In"},{"author_name":"Daniel Strech","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin \/ BIH Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Nutmeg Hallett","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Clare Morgans","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Price","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ern Ern Henna Tan","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emily Tudor","author_inst":"Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Julie Taylor","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Dominik Bettinger","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Oezlem Sogukpinar","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Siegbert Rieg","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Marcus Panning","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniela Huzly","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Schwemmle","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Georg Kochs","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Cornelius F.

Most histologic studies come from post-mortem analysis, with existing data indicating that histologic features of acute respiratory distress syndrome are typically present in fatal cases. However, this observation may be misleading, due to confounding factors in pre-terminal disease, including injury resulting from prolonged mechanical ventilation. Ante-mortem lung biopsy may provide major pathogenetic insights, potentially providing a basis for novel treatment approaches. AIM This comparative, multicenter, prospective, observational study was planned to identify ante-mortem histological profile and immunohistochemical features of lung tissue in patients with Covid-19 in early and late phases of the disease, including markers of inflammatory cells and major pathways involved in the cytokine storm triggering. METHODS Enrolled patients underwent lung biopsy, according to the study protocol approved by local Ethical Committee, either within 15 days of the first symptoms appearing (early phase) or after > 15 days (more advanced disease). Key exclusion criteria were excessive or uncorrectable bleeding risk and cardiovascular disease with heart failure. Lung samples were obtained by conventional trans-bronchialbiopsy, trans-bronchial lung cryobiopsy or surgical lung biopsy. RESULTS 23 patients were enrolled: 12 patients underwent lung biopsy within 15 days and 11 patients more than 15 days after the onset of symptoms. Early biopsies were characterized by spots of patchy acute lung injury (ALI) with alveolar type II cells hyperplasia and significant vascular abnormalities (disordered angiogenesis with alveolar capillary hyperplasia, luminal enlargement and thickened walls of pulmonary venules, perivascularCD4-T-cell infiltration), with no hyaline membranes. In the later stages, the alveolar architecture appeared disrupted, with areas of organizing ALI, venular congestion and capillary thromboembolic microangiopathy. Striking phenotypic features were demonstrated in hyper plastic pneumocytes and endothelial cells, including the expression of phospho-STAT3 and molecules involved in immunoinhibitory signals (PD-L1 and IDO1). Alveolar macrophages exhibited macrophage-related markers (CD68, CD11c, CD14) together with unusual markers, such as DC-Lamp\/CD208, CD206, CD123\/IL3AR. CONCLUSION A morphologically distinct Covid pattern was identified in the earlier stages of the disease, with prominent epithelial and endothelial cell abnormalities, that may be potentially reversible, differing strikingly from findings in classical diffuse alveolar damage. These observations may have major therapeutic implications, justifying studies of early interventions aimed at mitigating inflammatory organ injury.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio Doglioni","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, University Vita-Salute, Milan and San Raffaele Scientific Institute.

To describe the incidence, clinical course, and predictive factors of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection in a cohort of rheumatological patients residing in New Delhi (National Capital Region), India. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional, random telephonic survey from 20th April to 20th July 2020 on patients with rheumatic diseases. Patients were interviewed with a predesigned questionnaire. The incidence of COVID-19 in the general population was obtained from open access government data repository. Report of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction report was taken as confirmatory of COVID-19 infection. Results. Among the 900 contacted patients 840 responded (713 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 100 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 20 with spondylarthritis (SpA) and 7 with others; mean age 45 years, mean duration 11.3 years; 86% female). Among them 29 reported flu-like symptoms and four RA patients had confirmed COVID-19 infection. All of them were hospitalized with uneventful recovery. Rheumatological drugs were discontinued during the infectious episode. Disease modifying agents and biologics were equally received by those with or without COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was similar to general Delhi population (0.476% vs 0.519% respectively, p=0.86). Two patients had relapse of rheumatic disease after recovery. After recovery from COVID-19 or Flu-like illness, eight patients (27.6%, 95% confidence interval 14.7-45.7) reported disease flare. Conclusion. Patients with rheumatic diseases in India have similar incidence of COVID-19 infection compared to the community. Relapse of underlying rheumatic disease after recovery is not uncommon and continuation of glucocorticoid through the infection should be considered.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Uma Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rudra Prosad Goswami","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Danveer Bhadu","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Maumita Kanjilal","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Nagar","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Pallavi Vij","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Mittal","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Lakshman Meena","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Debaditya Roy","author_inst":"AIIMS"},{"author_name":"Stefano Maitan","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, G.B.

Several infection control strategies have been implemented. Particularly, evidence shows that universal masking can mitigate COVID-19 infection, though existing research is limited by secular trend bias. Aims: To investigate the effect of hospital universal masking on COVID-19 incidence among HCWs compared to the general community population. Methods: We compared the 7-day averaged incidence rates between a Massachusetts (USA) healthcare system and Massachusetts residents statewide. The study period was from March 17 (the date of first incident case in the healthcare system) to May 6 (the date Massachusetts implemented public masking). The healthcare system implemented universal masking on March 26, we allotted a 5-day lag for effect onset, and peak COVID-19 incidence in Massachusetts was April 20. Thus, we categorized March 17-31 as the pre-intervention phase, April 1-20 the intervention phase, and April 21-May 6 the post-intervention phase. Temporal incidence trends (i.e. 7-day average slopes) were compared using standardized coefficients from linear regression models. Results: The standardized coefficients were similar between the healthcare system and the state in both the pre- and post-intervention phases. During the intervention phase, the healthcare system's epidemic slope became negative (standardized {beta}: -0.68, 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.31), while Massachusetts' slope remained positive (standardized {beta}: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.05). Conclusions: Universal masking at the healthcare system was associated with flattening the COVID-19 curve among HCWs, while the infection rate continued to rise in the surrounding community.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan-Yun Lan","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, Harvard University T.H.

In this situation, the Spanish Government declared the lockdown of the country with the aim of flattening the epidemic curve. The variations of air pollution in terms of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in 8 cities of Spain are analyzed here considering the effect of meteorology during the COVID-19 lockdown period (from March 15th to April 12th 2020). The results of the analysis show that the 4-week Spanish lockdown was not long enough to reduce the PM2.5 levels in all the cities considered. These reductions were less than those expected, despite the drastically reduced human activity. Furthermore, no associations between COVID-19 accumulated cases and PM2.5 exposure or environmental conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, sunlight hours, maximum pressure) were found during the early spread of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alvaro Briz-Redon","author_inst":"City Council of Valencia"},{"author_name":"Carolina Belenguer-Sapina","author_inst":"University of Valencia"},{"author_name":"Angel Serrano-Aroca","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Valencia San Vicente Martir"},{"author_name":"Eirini Iliaki","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Medicine, Cambridge Health Alliance, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lou Ann Bruno-Murtha","author_inst":"Infection Prevention & Infectious Diseases, Cambridge Health Alliance, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Assaad J.

Transient production of spike in both HEK and CHO cells mediated by PEI was increased significantly (up to 10.9-fold) by a reduction in culture temperature to 32C to permit extended duration cultures. Based on these data GS-CHO pools stably producing spike trimer under the control of a strong synthetic promoter were cultured in hypothermic conditions with combinations of bioactive small molecules to increase yield of purified spike product 4.9-fold to 53 mg\/L. Purification of recombinant spike by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography initially yielded a variety of co-eluting protein impurities identified as host cell-derived by mass spectrometry, which were separated from spike trimer using a modified imidazole gradient elution. Purified CHO spike trimer antigen was used in ELISA format to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in sera from patient cohorts previously tested for viral infection by PCR, including those who had displayed COVID-19 symptoms. The antibody assay, validated to ISO 15189 Medical Laboratories standards, exhibited a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 92.3%.

Valves allow material release, but we theorised that valve design may direct material downwards towards patient and surrounding environment. Limiting transmission of diseases with aerosolised spread is a current and serious concern within healthcare worldwide. Filtering face piece masks (FFP) are an essential piece of protective equipment when treating patients with ongoing infection. However, valved masks in other settings such as elective theatre and by the general public may have unforeseen negative effects. Methods: A heating coil-based vaporiser was used to produce visible water vapour. A healthy test subject was then filmed wearing a variety of different masks and exhaling the water vapour. Results: Flexible pleated and solid-shell FFP masks direct exhaled material downwards in plumes exceeding 25 cm. Duckbill-shaped masks appear to direct exhaled vapour laterally, with a smaller plume. The effect is influenced by mask design and type of valve. Fluid repellent surgical masks reduce material directed downwards, and when used in conjunction with an FFP3 mask, appear to reduce the size and density of the exhaled vapour plume. The use of a visor was ineffective in reducing plume expulsion. Conclusion: A properly fit-tested FFP3-rated protective mask may only moderately limit expulsion of aerosolised particles from asymptomatic healthcare workers to patients, particularly in cases where procedures are being performed in close proximity to patients or in cases where mucosal surfaces are exposed. Further research in this area is needed.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Stubington","author_inst":"Royal Derby Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raguwinder Sahota","author_inst":"Royal Derby Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nima Mottacki","author_inst":"Sahlgrenska Academy University of Gothenberg Institute of medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Johnston","author_inst":"Royal Derby Hospital"},{"author_name":"Owen Judd","author_inst":"Royal Derby Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thilo H Pohle","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Sheetal Maisuria","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amina Bhayat-Cammack","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, U.K."},{"author_name":"Adam J Brown","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Kang Lan Tee","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Philip J Jackson","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Tuck Seng Wong","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Mark J Dickman","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Ravishankar Sargur","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, U.K."},{"author_name":"David C James","author_inst":"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, U.K."},{"author_name":"Luca Donati","author_inst":"Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

A total of 16,912 staff members were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 10 and June 24, 2020 with 1,799 (10.6%) testing positive. Nurses and midwives had the highest number of infections (33.2% of all infected HCWs) followed by non-clinical support service staff (31.3%), administrative staff (14.6%), allied health professionals (12.7%), physicians (5.2% and other clinical support staff (2.9%). Among 671 infected HCW surveyed by the infection prevention and control team immediately after the positive COVID-19 test was reported, exposure to a family member or roommate with confirmed infection each were reported by 9.5%. Two-thirds of the infected HCWs were symptomatic with fever (34.6%), cough (32.2%) and sore throat (15.8%) being the most commonly reported symptoms. Among the survey respondents, 78 (11.6%) were hospitalized, 9 (1.3%) required supplemental oxygen, 4 (0.6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit) and 2 (0.3%) required mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths. To understand the transmission dynamics and impact of facility designation as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 facility, we conducted a focused follow-up telephone survey on 393 COVID-19 positive HCW 1-6 weeks after diagnosis. Only 5% of respondents reported acquiring the virus from working at a COVID-19 designated facility while the remaining 95% reported working at a non-COVID-19 facility and acquired the infection from accidental exposure to a colleague (45%) or to a patient (29%). Among infected HCW at COVID-19 designated facilities, 82% reported used full PPE at all times while 68% of infected HCW at non-COVID-19 facilities reported using PPE as directed.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jameela Alajmi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew M.

Most current tests for SARS-CoV-2 are based on RNA extraction followed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assays that involve a separate RNA extraction and qPCR reaction for each sample with a fixed cost and reaction time. While automation and improved logistics can increase the capacity of these tests, they cannot exceed this lower bound dictated by one extraction and reaction per sample. Multiplexed next generation sequencing (NGS) assays provide a dramatic increase in throughput, and hold the promise of richer information on viral strains and host immune response. Here, we establish a significant improvement of existing RNA-seq detection protocols. Our workflow, ApharSeq, includes a fast and cheap RNA capture step, that is coupled to barcoding of individual samples, followed by sample-pooling prior to the reverse transcription, PCR and massively parallel sequencing. Thus, only one step is performed before pooling hundreds of barcoded samples for subsequent steps and further analysis. We characterize the quantitative aspects of the assay, and test ApharSeq on dozens of clinical samples in a robotic workflow. Our proposed workflow is estimated to reduce costs by 10-50 fold, labor by 5-100 fold, automated liquid handling by 5-10 fold, and reagent requirements by 100-1000 fold compared to existing testing methods.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alon Chappleboim","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Daphna Joseph-Strauss","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Ayelet Rahat","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Israa Sharkia","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Miriam Adam","author_inst":"Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, H"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kitsberg","author_inst":"Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, H"},{"author_name":"Gavriel Fialkoff","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Matan Lotem","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Omer Gershon","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Anna-Kristina Schmidtner","author_inst":"Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, H"},{"author_name":"Esther Oiknine-Djian","author_inst":"Hadassah - Hebrew University Medical Centre, Jerusalem 9112001, Israel; The Lautenberg Centre for Immunology and Cancer Research, IMRIC, Faculty of Medicine, Th"},{"author_name":"Agnes Klochendler","author_inst":"Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer Research, IMRIC, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9112001, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ronen Sadeh","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer Research, IMRIC, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9112001, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dana Wolf","author_inst":"Hadassah - Hebrew University Medical Centre, Jerusalem 9112001, Israel; The Lautenberg Centre for Immunology and Cancer Research, IMRIC, Faculty of Medicine, Th"},{"author_name":"Naomi Habib","author_inst":"Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, H"},{"author_name":"Nir Friedman","author_inst":"Silberman Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel; Rachel and Selim Benin School of Computer Science, Hebrew Univer"},{"author_name":"Carmela Grosso","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, GB Morgagni Hospital.

We performed a systematic review to determine the demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological factors associated with severity and mortality in COVID-19. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and WHO database for English language articles from inception until May 8, 2020. We included Observational studies with direct comparison of clinical characteristics between a) patients who died and those who survived or b) patients with severe disease and those without severe disease. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two authors independently. Results: Among 15680 articles from the literature search, 109 articles were included in the analysis. The risk of mortality was higher in patients with increasing age, male gender (RR 1.45; 95%CI 1.23,1.71), dyspnea (RR 2.55; 95%CI 1.88,2.46), diabetes (RR 1.59; 95%CI 1.41,1.78), hypertension (RR 1.90; 95%CI 1.69,2.15). Congestive heart failure (OR 4.76; 95%CI 1.34,16.97), hilar lymphadenopathy (OR 8.34; 95%CI 2.57,27.08), bilateral lung involvement (OR 4.86; 95%CI 3.19,7.39) and reticular pattern (OR 5.54; 95%CI 1.24,24.67) were associated with severe disease. Clinically relevant cut-offs for leukocytosis(>10.0 x109\/L), lymphopenia(< 1.1 x109\/L), elevated C-reactive protein(>100mg\/L), LDH(>250U\/L) and D-dimer(>1mg\/L) had higher odds of severe disease and greater risk of mortality.

The problem is not only that they are difficult to identify and test, but also that it is believed that they may constitute the bulk of the cases and could be crucial in the pandemic equation. We present a novel and simple algorithm to extract the number of these mild cases by correlating a COVID-line phone calls to reported cases in given districts. The key assumption is to realize that, being a highly contagious disease, the number of calls by mild cases should be proportional to the number of reported cases. Whereas a background of calls not related to infected people should be proportional to the district population. We present the plain mathematics of the method and as a working example we apply it to Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), where it is being currently used.

Here we characterize transmission risk between 1,178 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and their 15,648 close contacts based on detailed contact tracing data from Hunan, China. We find that 80% of secondary transmissions can be traced back to 14% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, indicating substantial transmission heterogeneities. Regression analysis suggests a marked gradient of transmission risk scales positively with the duration of exposure and the closeness of social interactions, after adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. Population-level physical distancing measures confine transmission to families and households; while case isolation and contact quarantine reduce transmission in all settings. Adjusted for interventions, the reconstructed infectiousness profile of a typical SARS-CoV-2 infection peaks just before symptom presentation, with ~50% of transmission occurring in the pre-symptomatic phase. Modelling results indicate that achieving SARS-CoV-2 control would require the synergistic efforts of case isolation, contact quarantine, and population-level physical distancing measures, owing to the particular transmission kinetics of this virus.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lidong Gao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiwei Luo","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Lingshuang Ren","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhifei Zhan","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Huang","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Qianlai Sun","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Liu","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA; ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

During this period, web interest in the novel coronavirus has undergone a drastic surge. Objective: The aim of this study was to quantitatively analyze the impact of COVID-19 on Web searches related to hygiene-preventive measures and emotional-psychological aspects as well as to estimate the effectiveness and limits of online information during an epidemic. We looked for significant correlations between COVID-19 relative search volumes and cases per region to understand the interest of the average Italian Web user during international, national, and regional COVID-19 situations. By doing so, from the analysis of Web searches, it will be possible to deduce the mental and physical health of the population. Methods: To conduct this research, we used the \"Google Trends\" tool, which returns normalized values, called \"relative search volumes\" (RSVs), ranging from 0 to 100 according to the Web popularity of a group of queries. By comparing the RSVs in periods before and after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Italy, we derived the impact of COVID-19 on the activity of Italian netizens towards novel coronavirus itself, specifically regarding hygiene, prevention, and psychological well-being. Furthermore, we calculated Pearson's correlations {rho} ; between all these queries and COVID-19 cases for each region. We chose a p-value (p) threshold =.1. Results: After the two initial spikes that occurred on February 23 and March 9, 2020, the general web interest in COVID-19 in Italy waned, as did the correlation with the official number of cases per region (p< .1 only until March 14, 2020). However, web interest was similarly distributed across the regions (ASV=92,SD=6). We also found that all trends depend significantly on the number of COVID-19 cases at national but not international or regional levels. Between February 20 and June 10, 2020, web interest relating to hygiene and prevention increased by 116% and 901%, respectively, compared to those from January 1 to February 19, 2020 (95% CIs: [115.3,116.3],[850.3,952,2]). Significant correlations between regional cumulative web searches and COVID-19 cases were found only between February 26 and March 7, 2020 ({rho}-best= .43, 95% CI:[.42.44],p= .07). During the COVID-19 pandemic until June 10, 2020, national web searches of the generic terms \"fear\" and \"anxiety\" grew by 8% and 21%, respectively (95% CIs: [8.0,8.2],[20.4,20.6]) compared to those of the period January 1, 2018 - December 29, 2019. We found cyclically significant correlations between negative emotions related to the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 official data. Conclusions: Italian netizens showed a marked interest in the COVID-19 pandemic only when this became a direct national problem. In general, web searches have rarely been correlated with the number of cases per region; we conclude that the danger, once it arrived in the country, was perceived similarly in all regions. We can state that the period of maximum effectiveness of online information, in relation to this type of situation, is limited to 3-4 days from a specific key event. If such a scenario were to occur again, we suggest that all government agencies focus their web disclosure efforts over that time. Despite this, we found cyclical correlations with web searches related to negative feelings such as anxiety, depression, fear, and stress. Therefore, to identify mental and physical health problems among the population, it suffices to observe slight variations in the trend of related web queries.

Mortality indicators are among the most salient measures of the impact of COVID-19. While demographers favor age-standardized death rates to track the pandemic, those are expressed in unintuitive metrics: deaths per 1,000 or fraction thereof. Declines in life expectancies provide more intuitive indicators of the impact of COVID-19 on the individual lifespan. Derived under the assumption that future mortality conditions will indefinitely repeat those observed during a reference period, however, life expectancies intuitive interpretation becomes problematic when that reference period is only a temporary phase in the diffusion of an epidemic. To avoid making any assumption about future mortality, I propose measuring instead the Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL), defined as the average difference between the actual and otherwise expected ages at death in an actual death cohort. For fine-grained tracking of the pandemic, I also provide an empirical shortcut to MUL estimation for small areas or short periods. I estimate quarterly MUL values for the first half of 2020 in 144 national populations and 122 sub-national populations in Italy, Mexico, Spain and the US. Across national populations, the highest quarterly values were reached in the second quarter in Peru (3.90 years) and in Ecuador (4.59 years). Higher quarterly values still were found in New York and New Jersey, where individuals died respectively 5.41 and 5.56 years younger on average than their expected age at death. Using a shorter, seven-day rolling window, I estimate the MUL peaked at 7.32 years in Lombardy, 8.96 years in Madrid, and 8.93 years in New York, and even reached 12.86 years for the entire month of April in Guayas (Ecuador). These results illustrate how the MUL provides an intuitive metric to track the pandemic without requiring assumptions about future mortality.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Heuveline","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ravi Kumar Arya","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Animesh Animesh","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ravi Dugh","author_inst":"The University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Zuber Khan","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lingshuang Ren","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhifei Zhan","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Huang","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Qianlai Sun","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Liu","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA; ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

In previous studies and reports from the UK and US evidence emerged that poverty related indicators had a significant statistical effect on case and mortality rates on district level. For Germany, it has largely been assumed that poverty is an equally relevant factor influencing the transmission rates of the outbreak mostly due to anecdotal evidence from local outbreaks in meat processing plants and reported incidents in poorer city districts. This paper addresses the lack of statistical evidence and investigates thoroughly the link between poverty related indicators and case and mortality rates of the outbreak using multivariate, multilevel regression while also considering the urban-rural divide of the country. As proxies for poverty the unemployment rate, the per capita presence of general practitioners (physicians), per capita GDP, and the rate of employees with no professional job training is evaluated in relation to the accumulated case and mortality numbers on district level taken from RKI data of June and July 2020. Interestingly, the study finds no evidence for a poverty-related effect on mortality for German districts. Furthermore, only employment in low qualification jobs approximated by the job training variable consistently affected case numbers in urban districts in the expected direction.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felix Ettensperger","author_inst":"Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Ravi Kumar Arya","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Animesh Animesh","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ravi Dugh","author_inst":"The University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Zuber Khan","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lingshuang Ren","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhifei Zhan","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Huang","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Qianlai Sun","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Liu","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA; ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.

Methods A multivariate model for the log10 of viral reproductive rate was constructed for each country using lockdown stringency (Oxford University tracker), temperature and humidity, for the 1st 110 days of 2020. This was validated by extrapolating to the following 51 days, and comparing the predicted viral rate and cumulative mortality with WHO data. The country models was extrapolated to July 2021 using projected weather forecast for four scenarios; continuing with the 11\/6\/2020 lockdown policy, 100% lockdown, 20% lockdown and no lockdown. Results From pooled data (40 countries), lockdown stringency had a strong negative correlation with log10viral reproductive rate (-0.648 at 21 days later). Maximum temperature correlated at -0.14, 14 days later and humidity correlated at +0.25, 22 days later. Predictive Models were generated for 11 countries using multivariate regression of these parameters. The R2 correlation for log10R0 ranged from 0.817 to 0.987 for the model generation period. For the validation period, the Pearson's coefficient of correlation for log10R0 ranged from 0.344 to 0.984 and for cumulative mortality from 0.980 to 1.000. Forward extrapolation of these models for 5 nations, demonstrate, that removing the lockdown will result in rapid spread of the disease ranging from as soon as July 2020 for Russia, UK, Italy and India to January 2021 for the USA. The current (11\/6\/20) lockdown in the USA, Spain, UK, France, Germany, Turkey can control the disease but other nations will need to intensify their lockdowns to prevent future resurgence. Most nations will require more stringent lockdowns in January than in July. Conclusion The viral reproductive rate is highly predicted by a combination of lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity. Country specific predictive models can provide useful forecast of policy requirements.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David SJ Ellis","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminister NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Dimitris I Papadopoulos","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ivo Donkov","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminister NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Samuel Bishara","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminister NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Zuber Khan","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lingshuang Ren","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhifei Zhan","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Huang","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Qianlai Sun","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Liu","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, China"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA; ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pranita Neupane","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Heng Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Miao Pu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Syed Ali","author_inst":"Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Arshad","author_inst":"Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheriza Baksh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Petros Karakousis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagis Galiatsatos","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"1) Pulmonology Unit, Thoracic Diseases Department.
