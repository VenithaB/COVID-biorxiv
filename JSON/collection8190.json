On January 21, 2020, the CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center and the WHO released its first situation report about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), sparking significant media attention. How Twitter content and sentiment has evolved in the early stages of any outbreak, including the COVID-19 epidemic, has not been described. Objective: To quantify and understand early changes in Twitter activity, content, and sentiment about the COVID-19 epidemic. Design: Observational study. Setting: Twitter platform. Participants: All Twitter users who created or sent a message from January 14th to 28th, 2020. Measurements: We extracted tweets matching hashtags related to COVID-19 and measured frequency of keywords related to infection prevention practices, vaccination, and racial prejudice. We performed a sentiment analysis to identify emotional valence and predominant emotions. We conducted topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. Results: We evaluated 126,049 tweets from 53,196 unique users. The hourly number of COVID-19-related tweets starkly increased from January 21, 2020 onward. Nearly half (49.5%) of all tweets expressed fear and nearly 30% expressed surprise. The frequency of racially charged tweets closely paralleled the number of newly diagnosed cases of COVID-19. The economic and political impact of the COVID-19 was the most commonly discussed topic, while public health risk and prevention were among the least discussed. Conclusion: Tweets with negative sentiment and emotion parallel the incidence of cases for the COVID-19 outbreak. Twitter is a rich medium that can be leveraged to understand public sentiment in real-time and target public health messages based on user interest and emotion.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard J.

As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS CoV 2. Methods and findings We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID DB01072) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions. Conclusions Our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID 19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sovesh Mahapatra","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Prathul Nath","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Manisha Chatterjee","author_inst":"Subharti Medical College Meerut"},{"author_name":"Neeladrisingha Das","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Deepjyoti Kalita","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Science Rishikesh"},{"author_name":"Partha Roy","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Soumitra Satapathi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20054627","rel_title":"Investigating the likely association between genetic ancestry and COVID-19 manifestation","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20054627","rel_abs":"Background The novel coronavirus: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly throughout the world leading to catastrophic consequences. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown discernible variability across the globe. While in some countries people are recovering relatively quickly, in others, recovery times have been comparatively longer and number of individuals succumbing to it are high. This variability in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility is suggestive of a likely association between the genetic make up of affected individuals modulated by their ancestry and the severity of COVID-19 manifestations. Objective In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential association between an individual's genetic ancestry and the extent of COVID-19 disease presentation employing Europeans as the case study. In addition, using a genome wide association (GWAS) approach we sought to discern the putative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and genes that may be likely associated with differential COVID-19 manifestations by comparative analyses of the European and East Asian genomes. Method To this end, we employed 10,215 ancient and modern genomes across the globe assessing 597,573 SNPs obtained from the databank of Dr. David Reich, Harvard Medical School, USA to evaluate the likely correlation between European ancestry and COVID-19 manifestations. Ancestry proportions were determined using qpAdm program implemented in AdmixTools v5.1. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between various ancestry proportions of European genomes and COVID-19 death\/recovery ratio was calculated and its significance was statistically evaluated. Genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed in PLINK v1.9 to investigate SNPs with significant allele frequency variations among European and East Asian genomes that likely correlated with differential COVID-19 infectivity. Results We found significant positive correlation (r=0.58, P=0.03) between West European hunter gatherers (WHG) ancestral fractions and COVID-19 death\/recovery ratio for data as of 5th April 2020. This association discernibly amplified (r=0.77, P=0.009) upon reanalyses based on data as of 30th June 2020, removing countries with small sample sizes and adding those that are a bridge between Europe and Asia. Using GWAS we further identified 404 immune response related SNPs by comparing publicly available 753 genomes from various European countries against 838 genomes from various Eastern Asian countries. Prominently, we identified that SNPs associated with immune-system related pathways such as interferon stimulated antiviral response, adaptive and innate immune system and IL-6 dependent immune responses show significant differences in allele frequencies [Chi square values (Chi square values >1500; P=0)] between Europeans and East Asians. Conclusion So far, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the likely association between host genetic ancestry and COVID-19 severity. These findings improve our overall understanding of the putative genetic modifiers of COVID-19 clinical presentation. We note that the development of effective therapeutics will benefit immensely from more detailed analyses of individual genomic sequence data from COVID-19 patients of varied ancestries.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ranajit Das","author_inst":"Yenepoya (Deemed to be University)"},{"author_name":"Sudeep D Ghate","author_inst":"Yenepoya Research Centre, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University)"},{"author_name":"Manisha Chatterjee","author_inst":"Subharti Medical College Meerut"},{"author_name":"Neeladrisingha Das","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Deepjyoti Kalita","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Science Rishikesh"},{"author_name":"Partha Roy","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Soumitra Satapathi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20053058","rel_title":"Indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20053058","rel_abs":"Background: By early April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected nearly one million people and had spread to nearly all countries worldwide. It is essential to understand where and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted. Methods: Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural cities (municipalities) in China, not including Hubei province, between 4 January and 11 February 2020. We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and associated indoor environmental issues. Results: Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases. Conclusions: All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Te Miao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Li LIU","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohong Zheng","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Danting Luo","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Soumitra Satapathi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052860","rel_title":"Portable and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19: Combined use of the miniPCR thermocycler and a well-plate reader for SARS-Co2 virus detection","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052860","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has crudely demonstrated the need for massive and rapid diagnostics. By the first week of July, more than 10,000,000 positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, although this number could be greatly underestimated. In the case of an epidemic emergency, the first line of response should be based on commercially available and validated resources. Here, we demonstrate the use of the miniPCR, a commercial compact and portable PCR device recently available on the market, in combination with a commercial well-plate reader as a diagnostic system for detecting genetic material of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19. We used the miniPCR to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences using the sets of initiators recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for targeting three different regions that encode for the N protein. Prior to amplification, samples were combined with a DNA intercalating reagent (i.e., EvaGreen Dye). Sample fluorescence after amplification was then read using a commercial 96-well plate reader. This straightforward method allows the detection and amplification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of ~625 to 2X105 DNA copies. The accuracy and simplicity of this diagnostics strategy may provide a cost-efficient and reliable alternative for COVID-19 pandemic testing, particularly in underdeveloped regions where RT-QPCR instrument availability may be limited. The portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of the miniPCR makes it a reliable alternative for deployment in point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection efforts during pandemics.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Everardo Gonzalez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Grissel Trujillo-de Santiago","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Itzel Montserrat Lara-Mayorga","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Sergio Omar Martinez-Chapa","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Mario Moises Alvarez","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Soumitra Satapathi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20053280","rel_title":"Longitudinal analysis of laboratory findings during the process of recovery for patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20053280","rel_abs":"Objective To explore longitudinal change patterns of key laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19, and to identify independent prognostic factors by examining the associations between laboratory findings and outcomes of patients. Methods The multicenter study prospectively included 59 patients with COVID-19 treated at Jilin province from January 21, 2020 to May 5, 2020. Laboratory tests were included haematological, biochemical, and immunological tests. Results Laboratory findings, the characteristics of epidemiological and demographic data were extracted from electronic medical records. Eosinopenia was shown in 52.6% cases at onset, and the average value of eosinophil continued to significantly increase thereafter. Lymphopenia was found in 40.4% cases at onset, and the average value of lymphocyte was slowly elevated after day 5. Thrombocytopenia was shown in 12.3% cases at onset, and the average value of mean platelet volume was decreased sharply after day 7. The values of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, creatinine kinase-muscle\/brain activity, and cardiac troponin I, serum cardiac markers, were beyond the upper limit of RI from 6.1% to 30.6% at onset. The abnormity of liver function tests, kidney function tests, electrolytes was 2.0%~59.2%, 2.0%~4.1%, 6.0%~30.0%, respectively.

We studied the exponential phase of the pandemic in Italy, Spain, and South Korea, and found the R0 to be 2.56 (95% CrI, 2.41-2.71), 3.23 (95% CrI, 3.06-3.4), and 2.36 (95% CrI, 2.22-2.5) if we use Bayesian priors that assume a large portion of cases are not detected. Weaker priors regarding the detection rate resulted in R0 values of 9.22 (95% CrI, 9.01-9.43), 9.14 (95% CrI, 8.99-9.29), and 8.06 (95% CrI, 7.82-8.3) and assumes nearly 90% of infected patients are identified. Given the mounting evidence that potentially large fractions of the population are asymptomatic, the weaker priors that generate the high R0 values to fit the data required assumptions about the epidemiology of COVID-19 that do not fit with the biology, particularly regarding the timeframe that people remain infectious. Our results suggest that models of transmission assuming a relatively lower R0 value that do not consider a large number of asymptomatic cases can result in misunderstanding of the underlying dynamics, leading to poor policy decisions and outcomes.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gary Lin","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Alexandra T Strauss","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Pinz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Diego A Martinez","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Katie K Tseng","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Emily Schueller","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Oliver Gatalo","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Yupeng Yang","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Simon A Levin","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Eili Y Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University, Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"For the CDC MInD-Healthcare Program","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20053769","rel_title":"Validation of reported risk factors for disease classification and prognosis in COVID-19: a descriptive and retrospective study","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20053769","rel_abs":"Risk indicators viral load (ORF1ab Ct), lymphocyte percentage (LYM%), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactic acid (LA) in COVID-19 patients have been proposed in recent studies. However, the predictive effects of those indicators on disease classification and prognosis remains largely unknown. We dynamically measured those reported indicators in 132 cases of COVID-19 patients including the moderate-cured (moderated and cured), severe-cured (severe and cured) and critically ill (died). Our data showed that CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, lactic acid and viral load could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients in different degrees. CRP, IL-6 and LYM% were more effective than other three factors in predicting prognosis. For disease classification, CRP and LYM% were sensitive in identifying the types between critically ill and severe (or moderate). Notably, among the investigated factors, LYM% was the only one that could distinguish between the severe and moderate types. Collectively, we concluded that LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable predictor for disease typing and prognosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the precise classification and prognosis prediction are critical for saving the insufficient medical resources, stratified treatment and improving the survival rate of critically ill patients. We recommend that LYM% be used independently or in combination with other indicators in the management of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Li Tan","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University)"},{"author_name":"Xinran Ji","author_inst":"Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital (301 Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Qi Wang","author_inst":"General hospital of Central Threater Command,PRC"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng li","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University)"},{"author_name":"Qiongshu Wang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Hongming Miao","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University)"},{"author_name":"Yupeng Yang","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Simon A Levin","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Eili Y Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University, Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"For the CDC MInD-Healthcare Program","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052878","rel_title":"Search for trends of Covid-19 infection in India, China, Denmark, Brazil, France.

NPIs are considered to be critical in order to at least delay the peak number of infected individuals and to prevent the health care system becoming overwhelmed by the number of patients to treat in hospitals or in intensive care units (ICUs). However, there is also increasing concern that the NPIs in place would increase mortality because of other diseases, increase the frequency of suicide and increase the risk of an economic recession with unforeseeable implications. It is therefore instrumental to evaluate the necessity of NPIs and to monitor the progress of containment of virus spreading. We used a data-driven estimation of the evolution of the reproduction number for viral spreading in Germany as well as in all its federal states. Based on an extended infection-epidemic model, parameterized with data from the Robert Koch Institute and, alternatively, with parameters stemming from a fit to the initial phase of COVID-19 spreading in different regions of Italy, we found that the reproduction number was decreased to a range below 1 in all federal states. The development in Germany suggests that NPIs can be partially released based on an established new culture of social distancing, face masks and mutual care within the population. However, any release of measures delays reaching low incidence numbers. The strategy to reduce daily new cases to a sufficiently low level to be controlled by contact tracing and testing turned out to work in Germany. This requires a responsible behaviour of the population, optimised contact tracing techniques and extended testing capacities in contact clusters.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sahamoddin Khailaie","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Tanmay Mitra","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Arnab Bandyopadhyay","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Marta Schips","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Pietro Mascheroni","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Binder","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Michael Meyer-Hermann","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Eili Y Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University, Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"For the CDC MInD-Healthcare Program","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20053017","rel_title":"A mechanistic population balance model to evaluate the impact of interventions on infectious disease outbreaks: Case for COVID19","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20053017","rel_abs":"Infectious diseases can be devastating, especially when new and highly contagious, producing epidemic outbreaks that can become pandemics.

In this work a deterministic model was developed, using elements from the SIR-type models, that describes individuals in a population in compartments by infection stage and age group. The model assumes a close well-mixed community with no migrations. Infection rates and clinical and epidemiological information govern the transitions between stages of the disease. The present model provides a platform to build upon and its current low complexity retains accessibility to both experts and non-experts as well as policy makers to comprehend the variables and phenomena at play. The impact of several possible interventions that have been or may be applied to slow the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak is evaluated. Key findings in our model simulation results indicate that (i) universal social isolation measures may be effective in reducing total fatalities only if they are strict and the average number of daily social interactions is reduced to very low numbers; (ii) selective isolation of only the age groups most vulnerable to the disease (i.e. older than 60) appears almost as effective in reducing total fatalities but at a much lower economic damage; (iii) the use of protective equipment (PPE) appears capable of very significantly reducing total fatalities if implemented extensively and to a high degree; (iv) extensive random testing of the population leading to infection recognition and subsequent immediate (self) isolation of the infected individuals, appears to be an ineffective intervention due to the required (unreachable with existing test sensitivities) high percentage of infection detections and the incapability to be sustained over time; (v) an increase in the number of critical care beds to directly save significant numbers of lives with a direct reduction in total final fatalities per each extra available critical care bed unit.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Rodriguez","author_inst":"Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Paton","author_inst":"Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Joao M Uratani","author_inst":"Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Juan M Acuna","author_inst":"Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Pietro Mascheroni","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Binder","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Michael Meyer-Hermann","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Eili Y Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University, Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"For the CDC MInD-Healthcare Program","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20053579","rel_title":"Adaptive cyclic exit strategies from lockdown to suppress COVID-19 and allow economic activity","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20053579","rel_abs":"Many countries have applied lockdown that helped suppress COVID-19, but with devastating economic consequences.

We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants, can prevent resurgence of the epidemic while providing part-time employment. The cycle pushes the reproduction number R below one by reduced exposure time and by exploiting the virus latent period: those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. The number of work days can be adapted in response to observations. Throughout, full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing, compartmentalization, testing and contact tracing. This conceptual framework, when combined with other interventions to control the epidemic, can offer the beginnings of predictability to many economic sectors.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omer Karin","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yinon M.

The amount of virus in a swab is likely to vary between patients, sample location (nasal, throat or sputum) and through time as infection progresses. Here, we analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. We identify that the probability of a positive test decreases with time after symptom onset, with throat samples less likely to yield a positive result relative to nasal samples. Empirically derived distributions of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation allowed us to comment on the likely false negative rates in cohorts of patients who present for testing at different clinical stages. We further estimate the expected numbers of false negative tests in a group of tested individuals and show how this is affected by the timing of the tests. Finally, we assessed the robustness of these estimates of false negative rates to the probability of false positive tests.

Controlling for population size, we find more viral infections in those areas afflicted by Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Higher mortality was also correlated with poor air quality, namely with high PM2.5, CO and NO2 values. In Italy, the correspondence between poor air quality and SARS-CoV-2 appearance and induced mortality was the starkest.

However, the effect of each of these measures remains hard to quantify. We design a multi-scale model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We describe the motion of individual agents using a social force model. Each agent can be either susceptible, infected, quarantined, immunized or deceased. The model considers both mechanisms of direct and indirect transmission. We parameterize the model to reproduce the early dynamics of disease spread in Italy. We show that panic situations increase the risk of infection transmission in crowds despite social distancing measures. Next, we suggest that pre-symptomatic transmission could be a significant driver of the infection spread. Then, we show that the restricted movement of the individuals flattens the epidemic curve. Finally, model predictions suggest that measures stricter than social distancing and lockdown were used to control the epidemic in Wuhan, China.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anass Bouchnita","author_inst":"Complex Systems and Interactions Team, Ecole Centrale Casablanca, Ville Verte, Bouskoura, Casablanca, Morocco"},{"author_name":"Aissam Jebrane","author_inst":"Complex Systems and Interactions Team, Ecole Centrale Casablanca, Ville Verte, Bouskoura, Casablanca, Morocco"},{"author_name":"Mahan Ghafari","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jose Lourenco","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Boaz Dudovich","author_inst":"Applied Materials"},{"author_name":"Eran Yashiv","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Amos J.

Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death in the United States. Design: A nationwide, cross-sectional study using county-level data. Data sources: COVID-19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. Main outcome measures: We fit negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county-level long-term average of PM2.5 as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state issuance of the stay-at-home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses. Results: We found that an increase of only 1 g\/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the COVID-19 death rate (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2%, 15%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: A small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate. Despite the inherent limitations of the ecological study design, our results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. The data and code are publicly available so our analyses can be updated routinely.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Wu","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Rachel C.

The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic. Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID 19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome. In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus (COVID 19) infections are infectious during the incubation period. In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g. droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus. By considering the above two factors, a modified SEIR (Susceptibility Exposure Infection Recovery) method have been used for predicting the spread of the infections in the state of Tamil Nadu which is located in the southern part of India.

Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to correlate with recovery and protection of this disease. However, the characteristics of these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical manifestations in patients. Methods Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time. Findings SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were unable to cross-reactive with SARS-CoV virus. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1, RBD, and S2 regions. The titers of NAbs were variable in different patients. Elderly and middle-age patients had significantly higher plasma NAb titers (P<0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P=0.0003) than young patients. Notably, among these patients, there were ten patients whose NAb titers were under the detectable level of our assay (ID50: < 40); while in contrast, two patients, showed very high titers of NAb, with ID50 :15989 and 21567 respectively. The NAb titers were positive correlated with plasma CRP levels but negative correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between humoral response and cellular immune response. Interpretation The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.

Its severity is best described by two parameters: its ability to spread and its lethality. Here, we combine a mathematical model with a cohort analysis approach to determine the range of case fatality rates (CFR). We use a logistical function to describe the exponential growth and subsequent flattening of COVID-19 CFR that depends on three parameters: the final CFR (L), the CFR growth rate (k), and the onset-to-death interval (t0). Using the logistic model with specific parameters (L, k, and t0), we calculate the number of deaths each day for each cohort. We build an objective function that minimizes the root mean square error between the actual and predicted values of cumulative deaths and run multiple simulations by altering the three parameters. Using all of these values, we find out which set of parameters returns the lowest error when compared to the number of actual deaths. We were able to predict the CFR much closer to reality at all stages of the viral outbreak compared to traditional methods. This model can be used far more effectively than current models to estimate the CFR during an outbreak, allowing for better planning. The model can also help us better understand the impact of individual interventions on the CFR. With much better data collection and labeling, we should be able to improve our predictive power even further.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charit S Narayanan","author_inst":"Mission San Jose High School"},{"author_name":"Aojie Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Mei Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Qimin Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Jun Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Shuai Xia","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yun Ling","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yuling Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Jingna Xun","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Hongzhou Lu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yumei Wen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Jinghe Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20045401","rel_title":"A case of SARS-CoV-2 carrier for 32 days with several times false negative nucleic acid tests","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20045401","rel_abs":"In 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei, China, causing severe respiratory disease in humans, and has been identified as a public health emergency of international concern.

In this paper, we collected the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, outcomes, laboratory results and images of a SARS-CoV-2 carrier with no significant past medical history. The patient was quarantined because of her colleague had been diagnosed. After the onset of clinical symptoms, chest CT results showed patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) in her lungs, but it took a total of nine nucleic acid tests to confirm the diagnosis, among which the first eight RT-PCR results were negative or single-target positive. In addition to coughing up phlegm during her stay in the hospital, she did not develop chills, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other clinical symptoms. Since initial antiviral treatment, the lung lesions were absorbed. But the sputum nucleic acid test was still positive. In combination with antiviral and immune therapy, the patient tested negative for the virus. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was detected only in the lower respiratory tract samples (sputum) throughout the diagnosis and treatment period. This is a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with common symptoms, and her diagnosis has undergone multiple false negatives ,suggesting that it is difficult to identify certain carriers of the virus and that such patients may also increase the spread of the SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lingjie Song","author_inst":"Non-coding RNA and Drug Discovery Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."},{"author_name":"Guibao Xiao","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Ziyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianqin Zhang","author_inst":"Chengdu medical college"},{"author_name":"Zhan Gao","author_inst":"Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shixia Sun","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Ziyang City"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Shaoxing Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Youjun Feng","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Guangxin Luan","author_inst":"Chengdu medical college"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lin","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Ziyang City"},{"author_name":"Miao He","author_inst":"Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."},{"author_name":"Xu Jia","author_inst":"Non-coding RNA and Drug Discovery Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."},{"author_name":"Hongzhou Lu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yumei Wen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Jinghe Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20051763","rel_title":"Virologic and clinical characteristics for prognosis of severe COVID-19: a retrospective observational study in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20051763","rel_abs":"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has progressed to a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The WHO and the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued interim clinical guidance for management of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but there is limited data on the virologic and clinical characteristics for prognosis of severe COVID-19. Methods: A total of 50 patients with severe COVID-19 were divided into good and poor recovery groups. The dynamic viral shedding and serological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were explored. The risk factors associated with poor recovery and lung lesion resolutions were identified. In addition, the potential relationships among the viral shedding, the pro-inflammatory response, and lung lesion evolutions were characterized. Results: A total of 58% of the patients had poor recovery and were more likely to have a prolonged interval of viral shedding. The longest viral shedding was 57 days after symptom onset. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid therapy, consolidation on chest computed-tomography (CT), and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive were all associated with poor recovery. Additionally, the odds of impaired lung lesion resolutions were higher in patients with hypoproteinemia, hyperlipemia, and elevated levels of IL-4 and ferritin. Finally, viral shedding and proinflammatory responses were closely correlated with lung lesion evolutions on chest CT. Conclusions Patients with severe COVID-19 have prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed intermittent viral shedding. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid usage, and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive might be utilized as predicative factors for the patients with poor recovery.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sha Fu","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Fu","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yang Song","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Health Management, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Pin-hua Pan","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chunhu Zhang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Jiang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Deming Tan","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuegong Fan","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinping Sha","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jingdong Ma","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Health Management, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yan Huang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shaling Li","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yixiang Zheng","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhaoxin Qian","author_inst":"Xiangya hospital, Central South Univrsity"},{"author_name":"Zeng Xiong","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Lizhi Xiao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Huibao Long","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianghai Chen","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi Ouyang","author_inst":"Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University,Changsha,China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20051557","rel_title":"Modelling fatality curves of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of intervention strategies","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20051557","rel_abs":"The main objective of the present paper is twofold: first, to model the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease, as represented by the cumulative number of deaths as a function of time; and second, to use the corresponding mathematical model to study the effectiveness of possible intervention strategies. We applied the Richards growth model (RGM) to the COVID-19 fatality curves from several countries, where we used the data from the Johns Hopkins University database up to May 8, 2020. Countries selected for analysis with the RGM were China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea, and Spain. The RGM was shown to describe very well the fatality curves of China, which is in a late stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as of the other above countries, which supposedly are in the middle or towards the end of the outbreak at the time of this writing. We also analysed the case of Brazil, which is in an initial sub-exponential growth regime, and so we used the generalised growth model which is more appropriate for such cases. An analytic formula for the efficiency of intervention strategies within the context of the RGM is derived. Our findings show that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, after the onset of the epidemic, during which effective countermeasures can be taken. We applied our intervention model to the COVID-19 fatality curve of Italy of the outbreak to illustrate the effect of several possible interventions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovani L.

This diagnostic nomogram was assessed by the internal and external validation data set. Further, we plotted decision curves and clinical impact curve to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this diagnostic nomogram. RESULTS: The predictive factors including the epidemiological history, wedge-shaped or fan-shaped lesion parallel to or near the pleura, bilateral lower lobes, ground glass opacities, crazy paving pattern and white blood cell (WBC) count were contained in the nomogram. In the primary cohort, the C-statistic for predicting the probability of the COVID-19 pneumonia was 0.967, even higher than the C-statistic (0.961) in initial viral nucleic acid nomogram which was established using the univariable regression. The C-statistic was 0.848 in external validation cohort. Good calibration curves were observed for the prediction probability in the internal validation and external validation cohort. The nomogram both performed well in terms of discrimination and calibration. Moreover, decision curve and clinical impact curve were also beneficial for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

Countries need rapid data on the prevalence of the virus in communities to enable rapid containment. However, the equipment, human and laboratory resources required for conducting individual RT-PCR is prohibitive. One technique to reduce the number of tests required is the pooling of samples for analysis by RT-PCR prior to testing. Methods: We conducted a mathematical analysis of pooling strategies for infection rate classification using group testing and for the identification of individuals by testing pooled clusters of samples. Findings: On the basis of the proposed pooled testing strategy we calculate the probability of false alarm, the probability of detection, and the average number of tests required as a function of the pool size. We find that when the sample size is 256, with a maximum pool size of 64, with only 7.3 tests on the average, we can distinguish between prevalences of 1% and 5% with a probability of detection of 95% and probability of false alarm of 4%. Interpretation: The pooling of RT-PCR samples is a cost-effective technique for providing much-needed course-grained data on the prevalence of COVID-19. This is a powerful tool in providing countries with information that can facilitate a response to the pandemic that is evidence-based and saves the most lives possible with the resources available.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishna Narayanan","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Frost","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Anoosheh Heidarzadeh","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Katie K Tseng","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Sayantan Banerjee","author_inst":"World Health Organization, South East Asia Regional Office"},{"author_name":"Jacob John","author_inst":"Christian Medical College, Vellore, India"},{"author_name":"Ramanan Laxminarayan","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ting Yang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daqing Chen","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liang Wang","author_inst":"College of Public Health, East Tennessee State University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Liu","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xian Shen","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shengwei Jin","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"E Fabian Cardozo-Ojeda","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Boeckh","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Joshua T Schiffer","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Zeng Xiong","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Lizhi Xiao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Huibao Long","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianghai Chen","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi Ouyang","author_inst":"Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University,Changsha,China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052183","rel_title":"Clinical meanings of rapid serological assay in patients tested for SARS-Co2 RT-PCR","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052183","rel_abs":"Background RT-PCR test for identifiction of viral nucleic acid is the current standard diagnostic method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease but technical reasons limit the utilization of this assay on large scale screenings.

Since modern ICU ventilators are powerful devices that can deliver very high gas flow rates and pressures, multiple physicians have attempted to ventilate more than one patient on a single ventilator -- so-called 'vent splitting'. Early applications of this approach have utilized simple concatenations of ventilator tubing and T-pieces, to provide flow to more than one patient. Additional approaches using custom flow splitters -- sometimes made using 3D printing technologies -- have also advanced into the clinic with FDA approval. However, heretofore there has been less progress made on controlling individual ventilatory pressures for patients with severe lung disease. Given the inherent variability and instability of lung compliance amongst patients with COVID-19, there remains an important need to provide a means of extending ventilator usefulness to more than one patient, but in a way that provides more tailored pressures that can be titrated over time. In this descriptive report, we provide the basis for a ventilator circuit that can support two patients with individualized peak inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures. The circuit is comprised of exclusively 'off the shelf' materials and is inexpensive to produce. The circuit can be used with typical ICU ventilators, and with anesthesia ventilators used in operating rooms. Inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures for each patient can be titrated over time, without changes for one patient affecting the ventilation parameters of the other patient. Using in-line spirometry, individual tidal volumes can be measured for each patient. This Pressure-Regulated Ventilator Splitting (PReVentS) Yale University protocol operates under a pressure-control ventilatory mode, and may function optimally when patients are not triggering breaths from the ventilator. This method has been tested thus far only in the laboratory with mock lungs, and has not yet been deployed in animals or in patients. However, given the novelty and potential utility of this approach, we deemed it appropriate to provide this information to the broader critical care community at the present time. In coming days and weeks, we will continue to characterize and refine this approach, using large animal models and proof-of-principle human studies.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Micha Sam Brickman Raredon","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Clark Fisher","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Paul Heerdt","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Ranjit Deshpande","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steven Nivison","author_inst":"Yale-New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elaine Fajardo","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Shamsuddin Akhtar","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Raredon","author_inst":"HB\/TR Collaborative Inc."},{"author_name":"Laura E.
