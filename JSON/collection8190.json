Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not been reported yet. Methods In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The cases were confirmed by real-time PCR and the demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was defined as hospitalization, discharged survivor and death, which was followed up until March 12, 2020. Results Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male. No significant differences in age and sex were identified between patients with and without diabetes. Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease condition with more complications at presentation, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%). Cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21) and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the fatality of COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions Diabetes mellitus is associated with greater disease severity and a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Primary and secondary prevention strategies are needed for COVID-19 patients with diabetes.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yanhui Cui","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Minxue Shen","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Xiangya Hospital; Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jianchu Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ben Liu","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Minhui Dai","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Linli Chen","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Duoduo Han","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Fan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wen Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Fengyu Lin","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Sha Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Pinhua Pan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042408","rel_title":"Acute kidney injury at early stage as a negative prognostic indicator of patients with COVID-19: a hospital-based retrospective analysis","rel_date":"2020-03-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20042408","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been pandemic all over the world. This study described acute kidney injury (AKI) at early stage of COVID-19 and its clinical significance. Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-+19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P<0.001). In conclusion, male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes are more susceptible to AKI. AKI at early stage may be a negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shen Xu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical Unversity"},{"author_name":"Lin Fu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Fei","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui-Xian Xiang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical Unversity"},{"author_name":"Ying Xiang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical Unversity"},{"author_name":"Zhu-Xia Tan","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical Unversity"},{"author_name":"Meng-Die Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical Unversity"},{"author_name":"Fang-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical Unversity"},{"author_name":"Ying Li","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ming-Feng Han","author_inst":"Second People's Hospital of Fuyang City"},{"author_name":"Xiu-Yong Li","author_inst":"Second People's Hospital of Fuyang City"},{"author_name":"De-Xin Yu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pinhua Pan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"urology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20037127","rel_title":"A Multicentre Study of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outcomes of Cancer Patients in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20037127","rel_abs":"Background: At present, there is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Two previous case series from China have suggested that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, but the reports were limited by small numbers and few clinical information. Objective: To study clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Four designated COVID-16 hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Medical records of 67 cancer patients admitted to hospitals between Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were included. Measurements: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected. Survival data of the cohort was cut-off on Mar 10, 2020. Results: Of the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients who had severe illness was older than that of patients who had mild symptoms (P<0.001). Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent chronic diseases, and the proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004). Twenty-three (34.3%) patients were still at the anticancer treatment phase, but no tumour progression and recurrence was observed for all the patients during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. About 70% of these patients had fever (n=53, 79.1%) and\/or cough (n=50, 74.6%). Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) with COVID-19 was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5\/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095). Limitation: This is a retrospective study with only 67 cases from four hospitals. And some specific clinical information was insufficient. Conclusion: This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. The tendency of poor prognosis was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase. We should pay more intensive attentions to cancer patients infected with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong-Yan Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lin-Wei Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Yuan Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Kun Shen","author_inst":"Convalife (Shanghai) Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Qun Wang","author_inst":"the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"You-Qin Yan","author_inst":"the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Yi Yu","author_inst":"Han Kou Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Qiuji Wu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ya-Hua Zhong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Melvin Chua Lee Kiang","author_inst":"National Cancer Centre Singapore"},{"author_name":"Cong-Hua Xie","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"De-Xin Yu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pinhua Pan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040600","rel_title":"Human leukocyte antigen susceptibility map for SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-03-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20040600","rel_abs":"We probe how genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across all known HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (1). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Austin Nguyen","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Julianne K David","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Sean K Maden","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Mary A Wood","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R Weeder","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Nellore","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Reid F Thompson","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Qiuji Wu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ya-Hua Zhong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Melvin Chua Lee Kiang","author_inst":"National Cancer Centre Singapore"},{"author_name":"Cong-Hua Xie","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"De-Xin Yu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pinhua Pan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042903","rel_title":"COVID-19 clinical characteristics, and sex-specific risk of mortality: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-03-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20042903","rel_abs":"Objectives: The rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. It was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China and has spread globally resulting in substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified the different aspects of this disease. Up to this date, no comprehensive systematic review for the clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic and mortality findings has been published. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis for a better understanding of COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. Publication bias was assessed and p <0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias. Results: Out of 1102 studies, 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 4789 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5 to 87.6), cough (65.2%, CI 58.6 to 71.2) and myalgia\/fatigue (34.7, CI 26.0 to 44.4) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7 to 24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9 %, CI 6.0 to 23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0% (CI 54.3 to 84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0 to 62.4) were the most common findings. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1 to 78.0) was the most common CT-Scan presentation. Pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1, P = 0.01). Conclusion: COVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory findings. Mortality associated with COVID19 was higher than that reported in studies in China with Males having a 3-fold higher risk of mortality in COVID19 compared to females.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Javad Nasiri","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sara Haddadi","author_inst":"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Azin Tahvildari","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yeganeh Farsi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahta Arbabi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Saba Hasanzadeh","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Parnian Jamshidi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mukunthan Murthi","author_inst":"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Mirsaeidi","author_inst":"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melvin Chua Lee Kiang","author_inst":"National Cancer Centre Singapore"},{"author_name":"Cong-Hua Xie","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"De-Xin Yu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pinhua Pan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042382","rel_title":"Viral Kinetics and Antibody Responses in Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20042382","rel_abs":"Background A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading over the world. However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and stools, respectively. Only 13 urines (5.6%) and 12 plasmas (5.7%) were viral positive. Prolonged viral shedding was observed in severe patients than that of non-severe patients. Cough but not fever, aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory specimens, meanwhile the positive stool-RNA appeared to align with the proportion who concurrently had cough and sputum production, but not diarrhea. Typical coronaviral particles could be found directly in sputum by TEM. The anti-nucleocapsid-protein IgM started on day 7 and positive rate peaked on day 28, while that of IgG was on day 10 and day 49 after illness onset. IgM and IgG appear earlier, and their titers are significantly higher in severe patients than non-severe patients (p<0.05). The weak responders for IgG had a significantly higher viral clearance rate than that of strong responders (p= 0.011). Conclusions Nasopharyngeal, sputum and stools rather than blood and urine, were the major shedding routes for SARS-CoV-2, and meanwhile sputum had a prolonged viral shedding. Symptom cough seems to be aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory and fecal specimens. Stronger antibody response was associated with delayed viral clearance and disease severity.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenting Tan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious

SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Guangzhou and elsewhere in China. Modes of contact and risk of transmission among close contacts have not been well estimated. Methods We included 4950 closes contacts from Guangzhou, and extracted data including modes of contact, laboratory testing, clinical characteristics of confirmed cases and source cases. We used logistic regression analysis to explore the risk factors associated with infection of close contacts. Results Among 4950 closes contacts, the median age was 38.0 years, and males accounted for 50.2% (2484). During quarantine period, 129 cases (2.6%) were diagnosed, with 8 asymptomatic (6.2%), 49 mild (38.0%), and 5 (3.9%) severe to critical cases. The sensitivity of throat swab was 71.32% and 92.19% at first to second PCR test. Among different modes of contact, household contacts were the most dangerous in catching with infection of COVID-19, with an incidence of 10.2%. As the increase of age for close contacts and severity of source cases, the incidence of COVID-19 presented an increasing trend from 1.8% (0-17 years) to 4.2% (60 or over years), and from 0.33% for asymptomatic, 3.3% for mild, to 6.2% for severe and critical source cases, respectively. Manifestation of expectoration in source cases was also highly associated with an increased risk of infection in their close contacts (13.6%). Secondary cases were in general clinically milder and were less likely to have common symptoms than those of source cases. Conclusions In conclusion, the proportion of asymptomatic and mild infections account for almost half of the confirmed cases among close contacts. The household contacts were the main transmission mode, and clinically more severe cases were more likely to pass the infection to their close contacts. Generally, the secondary cases were clinically milder than those of source cases.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Luo","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Dan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-long Liao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xian-bo Wu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qin-long Jing","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jia-zhen Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fang-hua Liu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shi-gui Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The"},{"author_name":"Bi Bi","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhi-hao Li","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jian-ping Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei-qi Song","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zheng-he Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xi-ru Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei-liang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hua-min Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042218","rel_title":"Estimating the ascertainment rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China: implications for management of the global outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20042218","rel_abs":"We sought to estimate the ascertainment ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China, using a modified Bayesian SEIR model with publicly reported case data.

SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bin Ju","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Ruoke Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Sisi Shan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Jinfang Yu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Jiwan Ge","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Lan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Youchun Wang","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Xuanling Shi","author_inst":"Tsinghua University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Linqi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zheng-he Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xi-ru Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei-liang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hua-min Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.20041475","rel_title":"An international comparison of the second derivative of COVID-19 deaths after implementation of social distancing measures","rel_date":"2020-03-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.20041475","rel_abs":"This work compares deaths for confirmed COVID-19 cases in China to eight other countries, Italy, Spain, France, USA, UK, Germany, Netherlands and South Korea.

Besides, post-translational modifications of the protein on 3D structure should be revealed in order to understand the protein function since these modifications are responsible for the host-pathogen interaction. Based on these, we predicted O-glycosylation and phosphorylation positions using full amino acid sequence of S1 protein. Candidate positions were further analyzed with enzyme binding activity, solvent accessibility, surface area parameters and the positions determined with high accuracy rate were used to design full 3D glycoprotein structure of the S1 protein using carbohydrate force field. In addition, the interaction between the C-type lectin CD209L and -mannose residues was examined and carbohydrate recognition positions were predicted. We suggest these positions as a potential target for the inhibition of the initial binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein to the host cell.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammet Uslupehlivan","author_inst":"Ege University"},{"author_name":"Ecem Sener","author_inst":"Ege University"},{"author_name":"Ruoke Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Sisi Shan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Jinfang Yu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Jiwan Ge","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Lan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Youchun Wang","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Xuanling Shi","author_inst":"Tsinghua University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Linqi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zheng-he Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xi-ru Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei-liang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hua-min Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.20043711","rel_title":"Estimating the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases manageable by a healthcare system","rel_date":"2020-03-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.20043711","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 Acute and Intense Resource Tool (CAIC-RT) is an interactive online tool capable of estimating the maximum daily number of incident COVID- 19 cases that a healthcare system could manage given age-based case distribution and severity.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasily Giannakeas","author_inst":"Women's College Research Institute, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Deepit Bhatia","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Matthew T.

There is no therapeutic treatment specific for COVID-19. It is highly desirable to identify potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 from existing drugs available for other diseases and, thus, repurpose them for treatment of COVID-19. In general, a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. Here we report a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions and its use in identifying drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The accurate FEP-ABFE predictions were based on the use of a new restraint energy distribution (RED) function designed to accelerate the FEP-ABFE calculations and make the practical FEP-ABFE-based virtual screening of the existing drug library possible for the first time. As a result, out of twenty-five drugs predicted, fifteen were confirmed as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The most potent one is dipyridamole (Ki=0.04 M) which has showed promising therapeutic effects in subsequently conducted clinical studies for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine (Ki=0.36 M) and chloroquine (Ki=0.56 M) were also found to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the first time. We anticipate that the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts.\n\nSignificance StatementDrug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. It has been demonstrated that a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions can reach an unprecedently high hit rate, leading to successful identification of 16 potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) from computationally selected 25 drugs under a threshold of Ki = 4 M. The outcomes of this study are valuable for not only drug repurposing to treat COVID-19, but also demonstrating the promising potential of the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhe Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xin Li","author_inst":"Ocean University of China"},{"author_name":"Yi-You Huang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Yaoxing Wu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Lingli Zhou","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Runduo Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Deyan Wu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Hao Liu","author_inst":"Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM)"},{"author_name":"Ximing Xu","author_inst":"Ocean University of China"},{"author_name":"Jun Cui","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Chang-Guo Zhan","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Ocean University of China"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xi-ru Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei-liang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hua-min Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.006544","rel_title":"Analysis of Serologic Cross-Reactivity Between Common Human Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 Using Coronavirus Antigen Microarray","rel_date":"2020-03-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.006544","rel_abs":"The current practice for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on PCR testing of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk.

Here, we describe the development of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates overall high IgG reactivity to common human coronaviruses and low IgG reactivity to epidemic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, with some cross-reactivity of conserved antigenic domains including S2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. This array can be used to answer outstanding questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, including whether baseline serology for other coronaviruses impacts disease course, how the antibody response to infection develops over time, and what antigens would be optimal for vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rie Nakajima","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Aarti Jain","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rafael Ramiro de Assis","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Alguimantas Jasinskas","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Joshua Miago Obiero","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Oluwasanmi Adenaiye","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Sheldon Tai","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Filbert Hong","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Donald K Milton","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Huw Davies","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Philip L Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"- Prometheus Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xi-ru Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei-liang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hua-min Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.002832","rel_title":"scRNA-seq reveals ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in TROP2+ Liver Progenitor Cells: Implications in COVID-19 associated Liver Dysfunction","rel_date":"2020-03-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.002832","rel_abs":"The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 was first reported in China (December 2019) and now prevalent in [~]170 countries across the globe. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into mammalian cells require the binding of viral Spike (S) proteins to the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor. Once entered the S protein is primed by a specialised serine protease, TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2) in the host cell. Importantly, beside respiratory symptoms, consistent with other common respiratory virus infection when patients become viraemic, a significant number of COVID-19 patients also develop liver comorbidities. We explored if specific target cell-type in the mammalian liver, could be implicated in disease pathophysiology other than the general deleterious response to cytokine storms. Here we employed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to survey the human liver and identified potentially implicated liver cell-type for viral ingress. We report the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a TROP2+ liver progenitor population. Importantly, we fail to detect the expression of ACE2 in hepatocyte or any other liver (immune and stromal) cell types. These results indicated that in COVID-19 associated liver dysfunction and cell death, viral infection of TROP2+ progenitors in liver may significantly impaired liver regeneration and could lead to pathology.\n\nHighlights- EPCAM+ Liver progenitors co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2\n- ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression is highest in TROP2high progenitors\n- ACE2 and TMPRSS2 cells express cholangiocyte biased fate markers\n- ACE2 and TMPRSS2 positive cells are absent in human fetal liver","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justine Jia Wen Seow","author_inst":"Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, 60 Biopolis Street, Genome, #02-01, Singapore 138672, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Rhea Pai","author_inst":"Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, 60 Biopolis Street, Genome, #02-01, Singapore 138672, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Archita Mishra","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), A*STAR, 8A Biomedical Grove, Immunos Building, Level 3 and 4, Singapore 138648, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Edwin Shepherdson","author_inst":"Department of Reproductive Medicine, KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Tony Kiat Hon Lim","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore 169608, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Brian K P Goh","author_inst":"Department of Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary and Transplant Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore 169608, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jerry KY Chan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Pierce KH Chow","author_inst":"Division of Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Centre, Singapore 169610, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Florent Ginhoux","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), A*STAR, 8A Biomedical Grove, Immunos Building, Level 3 and 4, Singapore 138648, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ramanuj DasGupta","author_inst":"Genome Institute of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ankur Sharma","author_inst":"Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, 60 Biopolis Street, Genome, #02-01, Singapore 138672, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Philip L Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"- Prometheus Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xi-ru Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei-liang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hua-min Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20038919","rel_title":"The impact of temperature and absolute humidity on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak - evidence from China","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20038919","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the impact of temperature and absolute humidity on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.

RESULTS The number of new confirm COVID-19 cases in mainland China peaked on Feb 1, 2020. COVID-19 daily incidence were lowest at -10  and highest at 10 ,while the maximum incidence was observed at the absolute humidity of approximately 7 g\/m3. COVID-19 incidence changed with temperature as daily incidence decreased when the temperature rose. No significant association between COVID-19 incidence and absolute humidity was observed in distributed lag nonlinear models. Additionally, A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model confirmed that transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature, leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak scale. CONCLUSION Temperature is an environmental driver of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Lower and higher temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence. M-SEIR models help to better evaluate environmental and social impacts on COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peng Shi","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Yinqiao Dong","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Huanchang Yan","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Li","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Chenkai Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Miao He","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Shixing Tang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shuhua Xi","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Ramanuj DasGupta","author_inst":"Genome Institute of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ankur Sharma","author_inst":"Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, 60 Biopolis Street, Genome, #02-01, Singapore 138672, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Philip L Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"- Prometheus Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xi-ru Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei-liang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hua-min Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040774","rel_title":"Hypertension and Diabetes Delay the Viral Clearance in COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20040774","rel_abs":"Objectives: Comorbidities have significant indications for the disease outcome of COVID-19, however which underlying diseases that contribute the most to aggravate the conditions of COVID-19 patients is still largely unknown. SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is a golden standard for defining the recovery of COVID-19 infections. To dissect the underlying diseases that could impact on viral clearance, we enrolled 106 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China between Jan 5 and Feb 25, 2020. Methodology: We comprehensively analyzed demographic, clinical and laboratory data, as well as patient treatment records. Survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modelling were employed to identify factors influencing the viral clearance negatively. Results: We found that increasing age, male gender, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) associated factors (including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases) adversely affected the viral clearance. Furthermore, analysis by a random forest survival model pointed out hypertension, cortisone treatment, gender, and age as the four most important variables. Conclusions: We conclude that patients at old age, males, and\/or having diseases associated with high expression of ACE2 will have worse prognosis during a COVID-19 infections.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoping Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Hu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxin Ling","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Zoonosis Science Center, University of Uppsala"},{"author_name":"Pingzheng Mo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yongxi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qunqun Jiang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Ma","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qian Cao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liping Deng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shihui Song","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ruiying Zheng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, 171 65, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johanna F Lindahl","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Zoonosis Science Center, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040782","rel_title":"A comparative multi-centre study on the clinical and imaging features of comfirmed and uncomfirmed patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20040782","rel_abs":"Background Previous studies had described the differences in clinical characteristics between ICU and non-ICU patients. However, seldom study focused on confirmed and unconfirmed groups. Our aim was to compare clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside Hubei province between confirmed and unconfirmed group. Methods We retrospectively enrolled 163 consecutive adult patients with suspected COVID-19 from three tertiary hospitals in two provinces outside Hubei province from January 12, 2020 to February 13, 2020 and the differences in epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics between the two groups were compared. Results This study enrolled 163 patients with 62 confirmed cases and 101 unconfirmed cases. Most confirmed patients were clustered (31, 50.0%) and with definite epidemiological exposure. Symptoms of COVID-19 were nonspecific, largely fever and dry cough. Laboratory findings in confirmed group were characterized by normal or reduced white blood cell count, reduced the absolute value of lymphocytes, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and accelerated Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The typical chest CT imaging features of patients with confirmed COVID-19 were peripherally distributed multifocal GGO with predominance in the lower lung lobe. Compared with unconfirmed patients, confirmed patients had significantly higher proportion of dry cough, leucopenia, lymphopenia and accelerated ESR (P<0.05); but not with alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, and myoglobin (P>0.05). Proportion of peripheral, bilateral or lower lung distribution and multi-lobe involvement, GGO, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram and pleural thickening in the confirmed group were also higher (P<0.05). Conclusions Symptoms of COVID-19 were nonspecific. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and ESR, as well as chest CT could be used as a clue for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Congliang Miao","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Jinqiang Zhuang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mengdi Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huanwen Xiong","author_inst":"High-tech Hospital, First Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Peng Huang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Yichun city"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Li Miao","author_inst":"High-tech Hospital, First Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Du","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xinying Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peijie Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Hong","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, 171 65, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johanna F Lindahl","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Zoonosis Science Center, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20040154","rel_title":"Predicting the number of reported and unreported cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea, Italy, France and Germany","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20040154","rel_abs":"We model the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic in South Korea, Italy, France, and Germany.

The questions we address are these: (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much? (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity? (3) When should such strategies be implemented? Our answers are as follows: (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten. (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late. (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion that it exists and will soon be closed. Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation\/lockdown implemented in the next week at the latest. If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and then strong mitigation\/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too late.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergei Maslov","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Nigel Goldenfeld","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Mengdi Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huanwen Xiong","author_inst":"High-tech Hospital, First Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Peng Huang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Yichun city"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Li Miao","author_inst":"High-tech Hospital, First Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Du","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xinying Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peijie Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Hong","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, 171 65, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johanna F Lindahl","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Zoonosis Science Center, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041079","rel_title":"Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041079","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is straining healthcare resources worldwide, prompting social distancing measures to reduce transmission intensity.

Intermittent distancing measures can maintain control of the epidemic, but without other interventions, these measures may be necessary into 2022. Increasing critical care capacity could reduce the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic while ensuring that critically ill patients receive appropriate care.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

The actual number of infected cases in France is probably higher than the observations: we find here a factor x 8 (95%-CI: 5-12) which leads to an IFR in France of 0.5% (95%-CI: 0.3-0.8) based on hospital death counting data. Adjusting for the number of deaths in nursing homes, we obtain an IFR of 0.8% (95%-CI: 0.45-1.25). Conclusions.

This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between exposure of infector and infectee), serial interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19. Methods Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI. To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates. Additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (< 0.3 day). Depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented. Findings In total, 1155 cases from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Malaysia were included for the final analysis. The mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6.70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before symptom onset of infector) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before the symptom onsets of infectors. In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, symptom onsets of infectees occurred before those of infectors. Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed. Interpretation This study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. The findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggests a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shujuan Ma","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jiayue Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Minyan Zeng","author_inst":"Peking University Shenzhen Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingping Yun","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Wei Guo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yixiang Zheng","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shi Zhao","author_inst":"JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, the Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Maggie H Wang","author_inst":"JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, the Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Zuyao Yang","author_inst":"JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, the Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peijie Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Hong","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, 171 65, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johanna F Lindahl","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Zoonosis Science Center, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20040121","rel_title":"Myocardial injury is associated with in-hospital mortality of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A single center retrospective cohort study","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20040121","rel_abs":"[Background] Since December 2019, a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread rapidly from China to other countries. In-hospital mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients are scarce. [Objectives] To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. [Methods] Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th February, 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. [Results] A total of 110 patients with confirmed (n=80) or suspected (n=30) COVID-19 were screened and 48 patients (female 31.3%, mean age 70.58{+\/-}13.38 year old) among them with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) test within 48 hours after admission were included, of whom 17 (17\/48, 35.4%) died in hospital while 31 (31\/48, 64.6%) were discharged or transferred to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was levated in 13 (13\/48, 27.1%) patents. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation (SpO2) on admission (HR 0.704, 95% CI 0.546-0.909, per 1% decrease, p=0.007), elevated hs-cTnI (HR 10.902, 95% 1.279-92.927, p=0.029) and elevated d-dimer (HR 1.103, 95%CI 1.034-1.176, per 1mg\/L increase, p=0.003) on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. [Conclusions] Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deyan Yang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Gao","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Taibo Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Kangan Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Quan Fang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Pan","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunfeng Yi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongru Fan","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liwei Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Fang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guowei Tian","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liqun He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20039867","rel_title":"A New, Simple Projection Model for COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20039867","rel_abs":"With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, an accurate model to predict how the coronavirus pandemic will evolve becomes important and urgent to help policy makers in different countries address the epidemic outbreak and determine policies to control spread more efficiently and effectively.

The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. In the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. Intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two ``zero\" points, respectively. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at a early stage of the outbreak. Method. To address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. Specially, we first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread, yielding four periods of the whole process corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two ``zero\" points. Then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. Finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the COVID-19 using the public available data for mainland China beyond Hubei Province from the China Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during the period of Jan 29th, 2020, to Feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. Results. Results show that our model can clearly outline the development of the epidemic at a very early stage. The first prediction results on Jan 29th reveal that the first and second milepost moments for mainland China beyond Hubei Province would appear on Jan 31st and Feb 14th respectively, which are only one day and three days behind the real world situations. Forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-late March, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-March and mid-April in mainland China beyond Hubei Province. The framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in counties where COVID-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huiwen Wang","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Beihang University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yanwen Zhang","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Beihang University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shan Lu","author_inst":"School of Statistics and Mathematics, Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Wang","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Taibo Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Kangan Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Quan Fang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Pan","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunfeng Yi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongru Fan","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liwei Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Fang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guowei Tian","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liqun He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20034504","rel_title":"High risk of infection caused posttraumatic stress symptoms in individuals with poor sleep quality: A study on influence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20034504","rel_abs":"The influence of the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on mental health was poorly understood.

These results indicate that keeping good sleep quality in individuals with high infectious risk is a way to prevent PTSS.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhilei Shang","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haiying Ma","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanpu Jia","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luna Sun","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Guo","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lili Wu","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhuoer Sun","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaoguang Zhou","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nianqi Liu","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Weizhi Liu","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liwei Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Fang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guowei Tian","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liqun He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040899","rel_title":"Analysis of psychological state and clinical psychological intervention model of patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20040899","rel_abs":"Background:Patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have different degrees of psychological pain, such as anxiety and depression, which may related to their prognosis. Psychological intervention can be conducted in different ways to improve psychological pain and improve the treatment effect. Objective:The present study aimed to investigate and analyze the psychological status of patients with COVID-19 during the course of illness, and to evaluate the effect and influencing factors of psychological crisis intervention, so as to explore the effective mode of clinical psychological intervention in acute patients under isolation environment. Methods:A total of 143 persons participated in the study, including 26 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward (COVID-19 group), 87 patients with general pneumonia in the observation ward (General Pneumonia group) and 30 healthy volunteers (Normal group). All the patients in the ward received comprehensive psychological intervention, including telephone psychological counseling (active and passive), self-adjustment of written materials and one-to-one psychological crisis intervention. Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate the mental health status of all patients on the day of admission and 1 week after treatment. Results:The scores of HAMA and HAMD of all patients (including isolation ward and observation ward) were significantly higher than the healthy volunteers at the time of admission. The total score of HAMA and HAMD in CVOID-19 group were both higher than that General Pneumonia group. After 1 week`s hospitalization with comprehensive psychological intervention, the scores of HAMA and HAMD in CVOID-19 group were significantly decreased. Conclusion:Patients those who diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward and\/or general pneumonia in observation ward have different degrees of anxiety, depression and sleep problems. While receiving antiviral treatment, patients also need psychological intervention. Comprehensive psychological intervention model has been proved to be effective.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lu Yang","author_inst":"Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo Hospital of Zhejiang University, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315211, P.R.

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged [&ge;]30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https:\/\/caliberresearch.org\/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. Findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged [&le;]70 years with [&ge;]1 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of [&ge;]2 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age>70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with [&ge;]3 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 80% in the UK population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. Interpretation: We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (do nothing) scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura Pasea","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Steve Harris","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Arturo Gonzalez-Izquierdo","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Ana Torralbo","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura Shallcross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Christina Pagel","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wai Keong Wong","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Claudia Langenberg","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bryan Williams","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Juan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guowei Tian","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liqun He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20031336","rel_title":"Characterizing occupations that cannot work from home: a means to identify susceptible worker groups during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20031336","rel_abs":"Objectives: Not all workers are employed in occupations in which working from home is possible. These workers are at an increased risk for exposure to infectious disease during a pandemic event, and are more likely to experience events of job displacement and disruption during all types of public health emergencies. Here, I characterized which occupational sectors in the United States are most able to work from home during a public health emergency such as COVID-19. Methods: 2018 national employment and wage data maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with measures from the BLS O*NET survey data. The measures utilized rank the importance of using a computer at work, and the importance of working with or performing for the public, which relate to the ability to complete work at home. Results: About 25% (35.6 M) of the U.S. workforce are employed in occupations which could be done from home, primarily in sectors such as technology, computer, management, administrative, financial, and engineering. The remaining 75% of U.S. workers (including healthcare, manufacturing, retail and food services, et al.) are employed in occupations where working from home would be difficult. Conclusions: The majority of U.S. workers are employed in occupations that cannot be done at home, putting 108.4 M U.S. workers at increased risk for adverse health outcomes related to working during a public health emergency. These workers tend to be lower paid than workers who can work from home. During COVID-19, this could result in a large increase in the burden of mental health disorders in the U.S., in addition to increased cases of COVID-19 due to workplace transmission. Public health guidance to work from home is not applicable to the majority of the U.S. workforce, emphasizing the need for additional guidance for workers during public health emergencies.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marissa G.
