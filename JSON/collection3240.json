The mechanisms by which this viral infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. In this brief report, we present data indicating that stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells by AngII leads to increased expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for the synthesis of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE). We suggest that increased expression of these chondroitin sulfotransferases and the ensuing production of chondroitin sulfates may contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to the progression of respiratory disease in Covid-19. The enzyme Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase), which removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate residues, is required for degradation of C4S and CSE. In hypoxic conditions or following treatment with chloroquine, ARSB activity is reduced. Decline in ARSB can contribute to ongoing accumulation and airway obstruction by C4S and CSE. Decline in ARSB leads to increased expression of Interleukin(IL)-6 in human bronchial epithelial cells, and IL-6 is associated with cytokine storm in Covid-19. These findings indicate how chondroitin sulfates, chondroitin sulfotransferases, and chondroitin sulfatases may participate in the progression of hypoxic respiratory insufficiency in Covid-19 disease and suggest new therapeutic targets.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sumit Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago and Jesse Brown VAMC"},{"author_name":"Kumar Kotlo","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago and Jesse Brown VAMC"},{"author_name":"Joanne Kramer Tobacman","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago and Jesse Brown VAMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.170936","rel_title":"Cellular exocytosis gene (EXOC6\/6B): a potential molecular link for the susceptibility and mortality of COVID-19 in diabetic patients","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.170936","rel_abs":"Diabetes is one of the most critical comorbidities linked to an increased risk of severe complications in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A better molecular understanding of COVID-19 in people with type diabetes mellitus (T2D) is mandatory, especially in countries with a high rate of T2D, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make T2D patients prone to aggressive course of the disease can help in the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve our response to the disease pandemic. Herein, we employed a system genetics approach to explore potential genomic, transcriptomic alterations in genes specific to lung and pancreas tissues, affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and study their association with susceptibility to T2D in Emirati patients. Our results identified the Exocyst complex component, 6 (EXOC6\/6B) gene (a component for docks insulin granules to the plasma membrane) with documented INDEL in 3 of 4 whole genome sequenced Emirati diabetic patients. Publically available transcriptomic data showed that lung infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed significantly lower expression of EXOC6\/6B compared to healthy lungs.\n\nIn conclusion, our data suggest that EXOC6\/6B might be an important molecular link between dysfunctional pancreatic islets and ciliated lung epithelium that makes diabetic patients more susceptible to severe SARS-COV-2 complication.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jalal Taneera","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Mahmood Yaseen Hachim","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Yaseen Hachim","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Saba Al Heialy","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sulaiman","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.167072","rel_title":"Molecular features similarities between SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS and key human genes could favour the viral infections and trigger collateral effects","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.167072","rel_abs":"In December 2019 rising pneumonia cases caused by a novel {beta}-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, which has rapidly spread worldwide causing thousands of deaths. The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern therefore several scientists are dedicated to the study of the new virus. Since human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on host cell machinery for replication and co-evolution, we selected the genes that are highly expressed in the tissue of human lungs to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. In our studies, we analysed 91 molecular features for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677873 codon positions. Hereby, we found that A\/T bias in viral genes could propitiate the viral infection favoured by a host dependant specialization using the host cell machinery of only some genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could have been further benefited by a high rate of A\/T in the third codon position. Thereby, the mistranslation or de-regulation of protein synthesis could produce collateral effects, as a consequence of viral occupancy of the host translation machinery due tomolecular similarities with viral genes. Furthermore, we provided a list of candidate human genes whose molecular features match those of SARS-CoV-2, SARSand MERS genes, which should be considered to be incorporated into genetic population studies to evaluate thesusceptibility to respiratory viral infections caused by these viruses. The results presented here, settle the basis for further research in the field of human genetics associated with the new viral infection, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 and for the development of antiviral preventive methods.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Maldonado Sr.","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiologia y Parasitologia Medica IMPAM-UBA-CONICET"},{"author_name":"Laura Kamenetzky","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiologia y Parasitologia Medica IMPAM-UBA-CONICET"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Yaseen Hachim","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Saba Al Heialy","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sulaiman","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.171744","rel_title":"Chasing the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada's COVID-19 cases: A genomics study","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.171744","rel_abs":"The emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has had profound social and economic consequences and has shed light on the importance of continued and additional investment in global health and infectious disease surveillance. Identifying changes in viral genomes provides key insights into viral diversity, how viruses spread within populations, and viral strategies for evasion of host immune systems. Here we report twenty-five SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected from some of the first COVID-19 cases in eastern Ontario, Canada (March 18-30, 2020). The reported genomes belong to the S-clade (n=2) and G-clade (n=23) of SARS-CoV-2 and contain 45 polymorphic sites including one shared missense and three unique synonymous variants in the gene encoding the spike protein. A phylogenetic analysis enabled the tracing of viral origin and potential transmission into and within Canada. There may be as many as sixteen unique infection events represented in these samples, including at least three that were likely introduced from Europe and seven from the USA. In addition, four separate genomes are each shared by multiple patients, suggesting a common origin or community spread even during this early stage of infection. These results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like SARS-CoV-2. Earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to prevent future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Maldonado Sr.","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiologia y Parasitologia Medica IMPAM-UBA-CONICET"},{"author_name":"Laura Kamenetzky","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiologia y Parasitologia Medica IMPAM-UBA-CONICET"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Yaseen Hachim","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Saba Al Heialy","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sulaiman","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.150326","rel_title":"Antiviral Drug Screen of Kinase inhibitors Identifies Cellular Signaling Pathways Critical for SARS-CoV-2 Replication","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.150326","rel_abs":"Emergence of a highly contagious novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, has precipitated the current global health crisis with over 479,000 deaths and more than 9.3 million confirmed cases. Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies. Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus, identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials. Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells. Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR\/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.\n\nDisclosuresNone declared.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gustavo Garcia Jr.","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Arun Sharma","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arunachalam Ramaiah","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Chandani Sen","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Donald Kohn","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Gomperts","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Clive N Svendsen","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Robert D Damoiseaux","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.170332","rel_title":"Comparison of 12 molecular detection assays for SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.170332","rel_abs":"Molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 is the mainstay for accurate diagnosis of the infection, but the diagnostic performances of available assays have not been defined.

Four structural proteins, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) glycoprotein, play a key role in controlling the entry into human cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2. However, how these genes evolve during its human to human transmission is largely unknown. In this study, we screened and analyzed roughly 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from GenBank database. The distribution of the four gene alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades based on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination event isnt detected among different alleles. However, purifying selection has conducted on the evolution of these genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8, M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure and a persistent D614G mutation is identified. The definitive positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy package. In addition, another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of the S protein is also identified. The allele containing D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability of isolates with the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural modeling shows that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of salt bridge among S protein monomers increase their flexibility, and in turn promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, virus attachment and entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein as it is, L5F mutation may facilitate the protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. This is the first evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to a better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this virus and help to provide insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches as well as effective vaccines by targeting on mutation sites.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Zhan","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xuefu Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ke Huang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Qian","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yang Leng","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Leping Yan","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Bihui Huang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yulong He","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.170639","rel_title":"The discovery of potential natural products for targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by virtual screening","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.170639","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters into the cells through its spike proteins binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein and causes virus infection in host cells.

This may have negative consequences for peoples health and wellbeing. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and COVID-19 disease attributable to training facilities. Methods: we randomized members 18 to 64 years with no COVID-19 relevant comorbidities at five training facilities in Oslo, Norway to access or no access to their facility. Facilities were opened from May 22, 2020 for individuals randomized to training, applying increased social distancing (1 meter for floor exercise, 2 meters for high-intensity classes), enhanced hand and surface hygiene. Locker rooms were open, showers and saunas were closed. We compared SARS-CoV-2 PCR status by self-administered naso-, oropharyngeal and sputum sampling after two weeks and clinical disease by linkage to electronic patient records after three weeks. Results: 3,764 individuals were randomized and included in analyses; 1,896 in the training and 1,868 in no-training arms. In the training arm, 81.8 percent trained at least once at the facilities. Out of 3,016 individuals who returned the SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, there was one positive test. The positive individual was randomized to training, but had not used the facility before testing day. Contact tracing revealed the workplace as transmission source. A total of 106 individuals had outpatient hospital visits, and six individuals were admitted to hospital during the three weeks after intervention start, with no differences between arms. There were no outpatient visits or hospital admissions due to COVID-19 in either group. Conclusions: Provided good hygiene and social distancing measures, there was no increased COVID-19 spread at training facilities.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- TRAiN study group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Michael Bretthauer","author_inst":"University of Oslo"},{"author_name":"Patrick Deelen","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Henry Wiersma","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Judith M Vonk","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Anil PS Ori","author_inst":"University Medical Center Groningen"},{"author_name":"Soesma A Jankipersadsing","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Robert Warmerdam","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Irene van Blokland","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Floranne Boulogne","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marjolein XL Dijkema","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Johanna C Herkert","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Annique Claringbould","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Olivier Bakker","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Esteban A Lopera Maya","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Ute Bultmann","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, Community and Occupational Medicine, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Zhernakova","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Sijmen A Reijneveld","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, Community and Occupational Medicine, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Elianne Zijlstra","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, Community and Occupational Medicine, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Morris Swertz","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Sandra Brouwer","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, Community and Occupational Medicine, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Raun van Ooijen","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, Community and Occupational Medicine, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Viola Angelini","author_inst":"Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Groningen, Nettelbosje 2, 9747AE Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Louise Dekker","author_inst":"Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Groningen, Nettelbosje 2, 9747AE Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Anna Sijtsma","author_inst":"Lifelines Cohort Study, Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Sicco A Scherjon","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jackie Dekens","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jochen O Mierau","author_inst":"Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Groningen, Nettelbosje 2, 9747AE Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"H.

However, the advantages and challenges of online-RDD for contact tracing (CT) have not yet been investigated from the perspective of public health professionals (PHPs). Therefore, it remains unclear if, and under what circumstances, PHPs are willing to apply online-RDD for contact tracing. Methods: First, between March and April 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch PHPs responsible for CT in practice. Questions were derived from the diffusion of innovations theory. Second, between May and June 2019 we distributed an online questionnaire to 260 Dutch PHPs to quantify the main qualitative findings. Using hypothetical scenarios that involved close-contact pathogens (scabies, shigella, and mumps), we assessed anticipated advantages and challenges of online-RDD and PHPs intention to apply online-RDD for contact tracing. Results: Twelve interviews were held and 70 PHPs filled in the online questionnaire. A majority of questionnaire respondents (71%) had a positive intention towards using online-RDD for contact tracing. Anticipated advantages of online-RDD were related to accommodating easy and autonomous participation in contact tracing of patients and contact persons, and reaching contact persons more efficiently. Anticipated challenges with online-RDD were related to limited opportunities for PHPs to support, motivate, and coordinate the execution of contact tracing, adequately conveying measures to patients and contact persons, and anticipated unrest among patients and contact persons. Online-RDD was considered more applicable when patients and their contact persons are reluctant to share sensitive information directly with PHPs, digitally skilled and literate persons are involved, and the scope of contact tracing is large. Online-RDD was considered less applicable when consequences of missing information or individuals are severe for individuals - or public health, when measures that patients and contact persons need to undertake are complex or impactful, and when a disease is perceived as particularly severe or sensitive by patients and their contact persons. Conclusions: PHPs generally perceived online-RDD as beneficial to public health practice. The method can help overcome challenges present in regular CT and could be used during outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via close-contact, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We propose a staggered implementation study to further investigate the application of online-RDD for enhanced CT during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yannick B.

Three months on, the disease and our understanding have both evolved significantly. As we now tackle a pandemic in very different contexts and with increased knowledge, we sought to build on the work of the WHO to gain a more current and global perspective on these initial priorities. Methods We undertook a mixed methods study seeking the views of the global research community to i) assess which of the early WHO roadmap priorities are still most pressing; ii) understand whether they are still valid in different settings, regions or countries; and iii) identify any new emerging priorities. Results Thematic analysis of the significant body of combined data shows the WHO roadmap is globally relevant, however, new important priorities have emerged, in particular, pertinent to low and lower-middle income countries (less resourced countries), where health systems are under significant competing pressures. We also found a shift from prioritising vaccine and therapeutic development towards a focus on assessing the effectiveness, risks, benefits and trust in the variety of public health interventions and measures. Our findings also provide insight into temporal nature of these research priorities, highlighting the urgency of research that can only be undertaken within the period of virus transmission, as well as other important research questions but which can be answered outside the transmission period. Both types of studies are key to help combat this pandemic but also importantly to ensure we are better prepared for the future. Conclusion We hope these findings will help guide decision making across the broad research system including the multi-lateral partners, research funders, public health practitioners, clinicians and civil society.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alice Norton","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"Arancha De La Horra Gozalo","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Nicole Feune de Colombi","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Moses Alobo","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Juliete Mutheu Asego","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Zainab Al-Rawni","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Emila Antonio","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"James Parker","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Wayne Mwangi","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Colette Adhiambo","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Kevin Marsh","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Marta Tufet Bayona","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"Peter Piot","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"Trudie A.

A main consequence of inactivity is a poorer general health and a higher mortality rate. Therefore, it is important to inform the public about practical recommendations for staying physically active, especially during the current Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Through a systematic review of literature in two databases (Pubmed\/Medline; Web of Science), studies were analysed which include practical recommendations for staying active during Covid-19 (Q1), or if they did not explicitly deal with Covid-19, research with useful results regarding the adaption to the present situation (Q2). Results: Currently, there are 6 studies published which are related to the first research question. In total, 26 papers, were found to correlate to the second one. Conclusion: Researchers need to be more specific in the exact recommendations for different age-groups and various health statuses. Key sources are the websites of the World Health Organization and the American Heart Association. In addition, exergames need to be adaptable to restrictions by product designers and to integrate social interaction-functions. Furthermore, it is essential that governmental actions need to be taken, with the help of researchers, to inform citizens about possible physical activities, with precise examples, clarification of benefits of the exercises, the exact exercise with duration, intensity and other substitute tasks for different age-groups and for people with diseases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Achraf Ammar","author_inst":"Otto-von-Guericke University, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hamdi Chtourou","author_inst":"Observatoire National du Sport; Universite de Sfax, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Khaled Trabelsi","author_inst":"Universite de Sfax, ; Sport et Sante, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Germany"},{"author_name":"James Parker","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Wayne Mwangi","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Colette Adhiambo","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Kevin Marsh","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Marta Tufet Bayona","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"Peter Piot","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"Trudie A.

This study aims to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and case-fatality rate of AKI in patients with documented COVID-19. Methods We reviewed the health medical records of 307 consecutive patients hospitalized for symptoms of COVID-19 at the University Hospital of Modena, Italy. Results AKI was diagnosed in 69 out of 307 (22.4%) patients. The stages of AKI were stage 1 in 57.9%, stage 2 in 24.6% and stage 3 in 17.3%. Hemodialysis was performed in 7.2% of the subjects. AKI patients had a mean age of 74.7 {+\/-} 9.9 years and higher serum levels of the main marker of inflammation and organ involvement (lung, liver, hearth and liver) than non-AKI patients. AKI events were more frequent in subjects with severe lung comprise. Two peaks of AKI events coincided with in-hospital admission and death of the patients. Kidney injury was associate with a higher rate of urinary abnormalities including proteinuria (0.448{+\/-} 0.85 vs 0.18 {+\/-} 0.29; P=<0.0001) and hematuria (P=0.032) compared to non-AKI patients. At the end of follow-up, 65.2% of the patients did not recover their renal function after AKI. Risk factors for kidney injury were age, male sex, CKD and non-renal SOFA. Adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that AKI was independently associated with in-hospital death (hazard ratio [HR]=3.74; CI 95%, 1.34-10.46) compared to non-AKI patients. Groups of patients with AKI stage 2-3 and failure to recover kidney function were associated with the highest risk of in-hospital mortality. Lastly, long-hospitalization was positively associated with a decrease of serum creatinine, likely due to muscle depletion occurred with prolonged bed rest. Conclusions AKI was a dire consequence of patients with COVID-19. Identification of patients at high-risk for AKI and prevention of kidney injury by avoiding dehydration and nephrotoxic agents is imperative in this vulnerable cohort of patients.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaetano Alfano","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Annachiara Ferrari","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Francesco Fontana","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Mori","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Magistroni","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Meschiari Marianna","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Franceschini Erica","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Marianna Menozzi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Cuomo","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Orlando","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Antonella Santoro","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Margherita Di Gaetano","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Puzzolante","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Federica Carli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Andrea Bedini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Jovana Milic","author_inst":"Policlinico di  Modena"},{"author_name":"Paolo Raggi","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology 4A7.050 Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute"},{"author_name":"Massimo Girardis","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cristina Mussini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianni Cappelli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Guaraldi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Raun van Ooijen","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, Community and Occupational Medicine, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Viola Angelini","author_inst":"Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Groningen, Nettelbosje 2, 9747AE Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Louise Dekker","author_inst":"Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Groningen, Nettelbosje 2, 9747AE Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Anna Sijtsma","author_inst":"Lifelines Cohort Study, Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Sicco A Scherjon","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jackie Dekens","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jochen O Mierau","author_inst":"Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Groningen, Nettelbosje 2, 9747AE Groningen, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"H.

We aimed to investigate correlations between clinical variables, cluster COVID-19 patients into subtypes, and generate a computational classification model for discriminating between COVID -19 patients and influenza patients based on clinical variables alone. We discovered several novel associations between clinical variables, including correlations between being male and having higher levels of serum lymphocytes and neutrophils. We found that COVID-19 patients could be clustered into subtypes based on serum levels of immune cells, gender, and reported symptoms. Finally, we trained an XGBoost model to achieve a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 97.9% in discriminating COVID-19 patients from influenza patients. We demonstrated that computational methods trained on large clinical datasets could yield ever more accurate COVID-19 diagnostic models to mitigate the impact of lack of testing.

COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness but an increasing number of clinical reports describe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. This is particularly true in children in whom GI symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. By contrast, fetuses seem to be rarely affected by COVID-19, although the virus has been detected in placentas of affected women. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can infect and replicate within the stomach once ingested. Moreover, it is not yet clear whether active replication of SARS-CoV-2 is possible in the stomach of children or in fetuses at different developmental stages. Here we show the novel derivation of fetal gastric organoids from 8-21 post-conception week (PCW) fetuses, and from pediatric biopsies, to be used as an in vitro model for SARS-CoV-2 gastric infection. Gastric organoids recapitulate human stomach with linear increase of gastric mucin 5AC along developmental stages, and expression of gastric markers pepsinogen, somatostatin, gastrin and chromogranin A. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection with minimal perturbation and under steady-state conditions, we induced a reversed polarity in the gastric organoids (RP-GOs) in suspension. In this condition of exposed apical polarity, the virus can easily access viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The pediatric RP-GOs are fully susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, where viral nucleoprotein is expressed in cells undergoing programmed cell death, while the efficiency of infection is significantly lower in fetal organoids. The RP-GOs derived from pediatric patients show sustained robust viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, compared with organoids derived from fetal stomachs. Transcriptomic analysis shows a moderate innate antiviral response and the lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, we established the first expandable human gastric organoid culture across fetal developmental stages, and we support the hypothesis that fetal tissue seems to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in early stages of development. However, the virus can efficiently infect gastric epithelium in pediatric patients, suggesting that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuseppe Giobbe","author_inst":"University College London - GOS Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Francesco Bonfante","author_inst":"izsvenezie"},{"author_name":"Elisa Zambaiti","author_inst":"University College London - GOS Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Onelia Gagliano","author_inst":"VIMM"},{"author_name":"Brendan C.

Controlling the pandemic requires a multifaceted approach including whole genome sequencing to support public health interventions at local and national levels. One of the most widely used methods for sequencing is the ARTIC protocol, a tiling PCR approach followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing (ONT) of up to 24 samples at a time. There is a need for a higher throughput method to reduce cost per genome. Here we present CoronaHiT, a method capable of multiplexing up to 95 small genomes on a single Nanopore flowcell, which uses transposase mediated addition of adapters and PCR based addition of symmetric barcodes. We demonstrate the method using 48 and 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per flowcell, amplified using the ARTIC protocol, and compare performance with Illumina and ARTIC ONT sequencing. Results demonstrate that all sequencing methods produce inaccurate genomes when the RNA extract from SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical sample has a cycle threshold (Ct) >= 32. Results from set same set of 23 samples with a broad range of Cts show that the consensus genomes have >90% coverage (GISAID criteria) for 78.2% of samples for CoronaHiT-48, 73.9% for CoronaHiT-94, 78.2% for Illumina and 73.9% for ARTIC ONT, and all have the same clustering on a maximum likelihood tree. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can multiplex up to 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per nanopore flowcell without compromising the quality of the resulting genomes while reducing library preparation complexity and significantly reducing cost. This protocol will aid the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing globally, to help control the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David J Baker","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Gemma L Kay","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Alp Aydin","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Thanh Le-Viet","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Steven Rudder","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Ana P Tedim","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience, Grupo de Investigacion Biomedica en Sepsis - BioSepsis.

Repurposing existing entities is one attractive approach. The heparan sulfate mimetic pixatimod is a clinical-stage synthetic sulfated compound that is a potent inhibitor of the glycosidase heparanase, and has known anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and also antiviral properties. Here we show that pixatimod binds directly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) and alters its conformation. Notably, this site overlaps with the known ACE2 binding site in the S1 RBD. We find that pixatimod inhibits binding of recombinant S1 RBD to Vero cells which express the ACE2 receptor. Moreover, in assays with three different isolates of live SARS-CoV-2 virus we show that pixatimod effectively inhibits viral infection of Vero cells. Importantly, its potency is well within its safe therapeutic dose range. These data provide evidence that pixatimod is a potent antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2. Together with its other known activities this provides a strong rationale for its clinical investigation as a new multimodal therapeutic for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Scott E Guimond","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Courtney J Mycroft-West","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Neha S Gandhi","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Julia A Tree","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karen R Buttigieg","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Naomi Coombes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kristina Nystrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Joanna Said","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Yin Xiang Setoh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alberto Amarilla","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"H.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays are the gold standard for detecting viral RNA in patient samples and are used extensively in clinical settings. Most currently used quantitative PCR (RT-qPCRs) rely upon real-time detection of PCR product using specialized laboratory equipment. To enable the application of PCR in resource-poor or non-specialist laboratories, we have developed and evaluated a nested PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using simple agarose gel electrophoresis for product detection. Using clinical samples tested by conventional qPCR methods and RNA transcripts of defined RNA copy number, the nested PCR based on the RdRP gene demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in clinical samples, but showed variable and transcript length-dependent sensitivity for RNA transcripts. Samples and transcripts were further evaluated in an additional N protein real-time quantitative PCR assay. As determined by 50% endpoint detection, the sensitivities of three RT-qPCRs and nested PCR methods varied substantially depending on the transcript target with no method approaching single copy detection. Overall, these findings highlight the need for assay validation and optimization and demonstrate the inability to precisely compare viral quantification from different PCR methodologies without calibration.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dung Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Uinversity of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Karen R Buttigieg","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Naomi Coombes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kristina Nystrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Joanna Said","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Yin Xiang Setoh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alberto Amarilla","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"H.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the virus surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients suffering from stroke are particularly susceptible to severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus forming a defined risk group. However, a mechanistic explanation for this finding is lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce lymphocytopenia and systemic inflammation that might modulate the expression levels of surface proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following stroke can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in the lung has not been investigated.\n\nMethodsMice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min and sacrificed after 24 h and 72 h for analysis of brain and lung tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1{beta} were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nResultsStrikingly, 24 h after stroke, we observed a substantial increase in the expression of ACE2 both on the transcriptional and protein levels in the lungs of MCAO mice compared to sham-operated mice. This increased expression persisted until day 3 after stroke. In addition, MCAO increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} in the lungs. Higher gene expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} was found in ischemic brain hemispheres and a reduced number of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate significantly augmented ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings might explain the clinical observation that patients with pre-existing stroke represent a high-risk group for the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our studies call for further investigations into the underlying signaling mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions.\n\nHighlightsBrain tissue injury increases ACE2 levels in the lungs\n\nBrain injury induces pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the lungs\n\nBrain injury causes parenchymal inflammation and systemic lymphopenia","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vikramjeet Singh","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Beer","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Kraus","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Xiaoni Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jinhua Xue","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dirk M Hermann","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Gunzer","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Joanna Said","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Yin Xiang Setoh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alberto Amarilla","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"H.

Various research groups are working toward development of vaccines and drugs, and many have published genomic and transcriptomic data related to this viral infection. The power inherent in publicly available data can be demonstrated via comparative transcriptome analyses. In the current study, we collected high-throughput gene expression data related to human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory viruses (SARS, H1N1, rhinovirus, avian influenza, and Dhori) and compared the effect of these viruses on the human transcriptome. The analyses identified fifteen genes specifically expressed in cells transfected with SARS-CoV-2; these included CSF2 (colony-stimulating factor 2) and S100A8 and S100A9 (calcium-binding proteins), all of which are involved in lung\/respiratory disorders. The analyses showed that genes involved in the Type1 interferon signaling pathway and the apoptosis process are commonly altered by infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Furthermore, results of protein-protein interaction analyses were consistent with a functional role of CSF2 in COVID-19 disease. In conclusion, our analysis has revealed cellular genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human lung epithelium; these are potential therapeutic targets.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Darshan S Chandrashekar","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Upender Manne","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sooryanarayana Varambally","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Xiaoni Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jinhua Xue","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dirk M Hermann","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Gunzer","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Joanna Said","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Yin Xiang Setoh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alberto Amarilla","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"H.

We searched for polymorphisms acting, in non-diseased lung tissue of 408 patients, as eQTLs for 15 candidate COVID-19 susceptibility genes, selected for their roles in virus cell entry and host antiviral responses. Seven cis-eQTLs were detected for APOBEC3D and APOBEC3G genes, which encode enzymes that interfere with virus replication. No significant eQTLs were identified for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes. Therefore, the identified eQTLs may represent candidate loci modulating interindividual differences in risk or severity of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chiara E.

The N-glycan structure and composition of this glycoprotein influence how the virus interacts with host cells.Objective To identify a putative N-glycan biosynthesis pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293 cell recombinant) from previously published mass spectrometric studies, and to identify what effect blocking some enzymes has on the overall glycoprotein profile. Finally, our goal was to provide the biosynthesis network, and glycans in easy-to-use format for further glycoinformatics work.Methods We reconstructed the glycosylation network based on previously published empirical data using GNAT, a glycosylation network analysis tool. Our compilation of the network tool had 23 glycosyltransferase and glucosidase enzymes, and could infer the pathway of glycosylation machinery based on glycans identified in the virus spike protein. Once the glycan biosynthesis pathway was generated, we simulated the effect of blocking specific enzymes - Mannosidase-II and alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase to see how they would affect the biosynthesis network.Results Of the 23 enzymes, a total of 12 were involved in glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 - Man-Ia, MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT4, MGAT5, B4GalT, B4GalT, Man II, SiaT, ST3GalI, ST3GalVI and FucT8. Blocking enzymes resulted in a substantially modified glycan profile of the protein.Conclusions A network analysis of N-glycan biosynthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows an elaborate enzymatic pathway with several intermediate glycans, along with the ones identified by mass spectrometric studies. Variations in the final N-glycan profile of the virus, given its site-specific microheterogeneity, could be a factor in the host response to the infection and response to antibodies. Here we provide all the resources generated - the glycans derived from mass spectrometry and intermediate glycans in glycoCT xml format, and the biosynthesis network for future drug and vaccine development work.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sridevi Krishnan","author_inst":"University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Giri P Krishnan","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Tommaso A.

Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD.\n\nWe collected (un)inflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing data, and microarrays from tissue pre\/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed.\n\nIn inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas colonic ACE2 expression was higher in inflamed colon of CD\/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression. Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2 dysregulation in responders.\n\nIntestinal inflammation alters SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors in the intestine, with opposing effects in ileum and colon. HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene, is an important upstream regulator of ACE2 in ileum, whereas interferon signaling dominates in colon. Our data support the importance of adequate control of IBD in order to reduce risk of (complicated) COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bram Verstockt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Sare Verstockt","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Saeed Adbu Rahiman","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Bo-Jun Ke","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Kaline Arnauts","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cleynen","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Joao Sabino","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Marc Ferrante","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Matteoli","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Severine Vermeire","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"H.

ACE2 is also the receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONProliferative (n = 9) and secretory (n = 6) phase endometrium biopsies from healthy reproductive-age women and primary human endometrial stromal cells from proliferative phase endometrium were used in the study.\n\nPARTICIPANTS\/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSACE2 expression and localization were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in both human endometrial samples and mouse uterine tissue. The effect of ACE2 knockdown on morphological and molecular changes of human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were assessed. Ovariectomized mice were treated with estrogen or progesterone to determine the effects of these hormones on ACE2 expression.\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEIn human tissue, ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA (P < 0.0001) and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA were less able to decidualize than controls, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 (P < 0.05). In mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced expression of Ace2 mRNA in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen (P < 0.05).\n\nLARGE SCALE DATAN\/A.\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONExperiments assessing the function of ACE2 in human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were in vitro. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can enter human endometrial stromal cells and affect decidualization have not been assessed.\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSExpression of ACE2 in the endometrium allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, which could impair in vivo decidualization, embryo implantation, and placentation. If so, women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of early pregnancy loss.\n\nSTUDY FUNDINGS\/COMPETING INTEREST(S)This study was supported by National Institutes of Health \/ National Institute of Child Health and Human Development grants R01HD065435 and R00HD080742 to RK and Washington University School of Medicine start-up funds to RK.

This virus causes COVID-19 disease, has infected millions of people, and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths across the globe. While the best interventions to control and ultimately stop the pandemic are prophylactic vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are important to limit morbidity and mortality in those already infected. At this time, only one FDA approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, remdesivir, is available and unfortunately, its efficacy appears to be limited. Thus, the identification of new and efficacious antivirals is of highest importance. In order to facilitate rapid drug discovery, flexible, sensitive, and high-throughput screening methods are required. With respect to drug targets, most attention is focused on either the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the main viral protease, 3CLpro. 3CLpro is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics as it is essential for processing newly translated viral proteins, and the viral lifecycle cannot be completed without protease activity. In this work, we present a new assay to identify inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. Our reporter is based on a GFP-derived protein that only fluoresces after cleavage by 3CLpro. This experimentally optimized reporter assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible protocols. Using this screening approach in combination with existing drug libraries may lead to the rapid identification of novel antivirals to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic has already led to more than 400,000 deaths and innumerable changes to daily life worldwide. Along with development of a vaccine, identification of effective antivirals to treat infected patients is of the highest importance. However, rapid drug discovery requires efficient methods to identify novel compounds that can inhibit the virus. In this work, we present a method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. This reporter-based assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible sample processing and analysis. This assay may help identify novel antivirals to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Heather M Froggatt","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Brook E Heaton","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Ramakrishna Kommagani","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kaline Arnauts","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cleynen","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Joao Sabino","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Marc Ferrante","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Matteoli","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Severine Vermeire","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"H.

An area of research interest is coronavirus transcription regulation that uses an RNA-RNA mediated template-switching mechanism. It is not known how different transcriptional stoichiometries of each viral gene are generated. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing data from whole RNA transcriptomes identified TRS dependent and independent transcripts. Integration of transcripts and 5-UTR sequence motifs identified that the pentaloop and the stem-loop 3 were also located upstream of spliced genes. TRS independent transcripts were detected as likely non-polyadenylated. Additionally, a novel conserved sequence motif was discovered at either end of the TRS independent splice junctions. While similar both SARS viruses generated similar TRS independent transcripts they were more abundant in SARS-CoV-2. TRS independent gene regulation requires investigation to determine its relationship to viral pathogenicity.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian J.
