Method: This study enrolled a total of 178 patients at Huangshi Central Hospital from January to February, 2020. Among them, 68 patients were SARS-COV-2 infected confirmed with nucleic acid test (NAT) and CT imaging. 9 patients were in the suspected group (NAT negative) with fever and other respiratory symptoms. 101 patients were in the control group with other diseases and negative to SARS-COV-2 infection. After serum samples were collected, SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for all patients. Results: The specificity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-COV-2 were 99.01% (100\/101) and 96.04% (97\/101) respectively, and the sensitivity were 88.24% (60\/68) and 97.06% (66\/68) respectively. The combined detection rate of SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were 98.53% (67\/68). Conclusion: Combined detection of serum SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies had better sensitivity compared with single IgM or IgG test, which can be used as an important diagnostic tool for SARS-COV-2 infection and a screening tool of potential SARS-COV-2 carriers in clinics, hospitals and accredited scientific laboratory.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fang Hu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Huangshi Central Hospital, Edong Healthcare Group (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Shang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Huangshi Central Hospital, Edong Healthcare Group (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"},{"author_name":"Meizhou Chen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Huangshi Central Hospital, Edong Healthcare Group (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"},{"author_name":"Changliang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Huangshi Central Hospital, Edong Healthcare Group (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.20148106","rel_title":"Novel SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody and neutralization assays reveal wide range of humoral immune response during COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.20148106","rel_abs":"Development of antibody protection during SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) infection is a pressing question for public health and for vaccine development. We developed highly sensitive CoV-2-specific antibody and neutralization assays. CoV-2 Spike protein or Nucleocapsid protein specific IgG antibodies at titers more than 1:100,000 were detectable in all PCR+ subjects (n=87) and were absent in the negative controls. Other isotype antibodies (IgA, IgG1-4) were also detected. CoV-2 neutralization was determined in COVID-19 and convalescent plasma up to 10,000-fold dilution, using Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses, which was also blocked by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Hospitalized patients had up to 3000-fold higher antibody and neutralization titers compared to outpatients or convalescent plasma donors. Further, subjects who donated plasma further out from the diagnosis of COVID-19 appeared to have lower titers. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients also contained NAbs against SARS Spike protein pseudovirus. Together these results demonstrate the high specificity and sensitivity of our assays, which may impact understanding the quality or duration of the antibody response during COVID-19 and in determining the effectiveness of potential vaccines.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mikail Dogan","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lina Kozhaya","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Placek","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Courtney Gunter","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Mesut Yigit","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hardy","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Matt Plassmeyer","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Paige Coatney","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Kimberleigh Lillard","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Zaheer Bukhari","author_inst":"Suny Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Kleinberg","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Chelsea Hayes","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Moshe Arditi","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ellen Klapper","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Noah Merin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bruce T Liang","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Raavi Gupta","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oral Alpan","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Derya Unutmaz","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.20148510","rel_title":"Modeling reductions in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and hospital burden achieved by prioritizing testing using a clinical prediction rule","rel_date":"2020-07-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.20148510","rel_abs":"Prompt identification of cases is critical for slowing the spread of COVID-19. However, many areas have faced diagnostic testing shortages, requiring difficult decisions to be made regarding who receives a test, without knowing the implications of those decisions on population-level transmission dynamics. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are commonly used tools to guide clinical decisions. We used data from electronic health records to develop a parsimonious 5-variable CPR to identify those who are most likely to test positive, and found that its application to prioritize testing increases the proportion of those testing positive in settings of limited testing capacity. To consider the implications of these gains in daily case detection on the population level, we incorporated testing using the CPR into a compartmentalized disease transmission model. We found that prioritized testing led to a delayed and lowered infection peak (i.e. 'flattens the curve'), with the greatest impact at lower values of the effective reproductive number (such as with concurrent social distancing measures), and when higher proportions of infectious persons seek testing. Additionally, prioritized testing resulted in reductions in overall infections as well as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) burden. In conclusion, we present a novel approach to evidence-based allocation of limited diagnostic capacity, to achieve public health goals for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jody R Reimer","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sharia M Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Brintz","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Rashmee U Shah","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Lindsay T Keegan","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Ferrari","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T Leung","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Paige Coatney","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Kimberleigh Lillard","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Zaheer Bukhari","author_inst":"Suny Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Kleinberg","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Chelsea Hayes","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Moshe Arditi","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ellen Klapper","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Noah Merin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bruce T Liang","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Raavi Gupta","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oral Alpan","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Derya Unutmaz","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.06.20147199","rel_title":"Ranking the effectiveness of worldwide COVID-19 government interventions","rel_date":"2020-07-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.06.20147199","rel_abs":"Assessing the effectiveness of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to inform future preparedness response plans.

Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. Methods: Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >= 37.5C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the baseline case fatality ratio (CFR), which was adjusted for delays and under-ascertainment, then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. Results: Based on reported cases and deaths, we estimated that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.4% (Bangladesh) to 100% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6th July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 18 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. As of the 7th June, our seroprevalence estimates range from 0% (many countries) to 13% (95% CrI: 5.6% - 24%) (Belgium). Conclusions: We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nick Golding","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute and Curtin University"},{"author_name":"Joel Hellewell","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Wright","author_inst":"Defence Science and Technology Laboratory\/Sopra Steria, Fareham, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hamish Gibbs","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John W Edmunds","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ellen Klapper","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Noah Merin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bruce T Liang","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Raavi Gupta","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oral Alpan","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Derya Unutmaz","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.179028","rel_title":"Genes associated with liver damage signalling pathways may impact the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in Spanish and Italian populations","rel_date":"2020-07-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.179028","rel_abs":"AimThe novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has infected more than 10 million people and caused 500K deaths worldwide. In Europe, over 2 million confirmed cases have been reported, while nearly 200K people have died from the disease. Despite strict containment measures in Spain and Italy after the first reported COVID-19 patient, these two countries have remained in the top five European nations with the highest mortality rate for over two months. We hypothesised that a genetic mechanism could partially explain the poor survival outcome observed in these two countries.\n\nMethodsAn extensive literature search to identify human candidate genes linked to SARS-CoV infection, host immune evasion and disease aggressiveness was carried out. Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to select the most significantly associated canonical signalling pathways with the genes of interest. The genetic variants at these genes with {+\/-}1Mb flanking region was extracted (GRCh37\/hg19 built). Over 80 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in genome-wide data of 2,504 individuals (1000 genomes, phase III, https:\/\/www.internationalgenome.org\/). Principal component (PC) analysis was performed, ancestry by the whole genome was inferred and subsets of the regions of interest were extracted (PLINK v1.9b, http:\/\/pngu.mgh.harvard.edu\/purcell\/plink\/). PC1 to PC20 values from five European ancestries, including the Spanish and Italian populations, were used for PC analysis. Gene function predictions were run with our genes of interest as a query to the GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin (https:\/\/genemania.org\/).\n\nResultsA total of 437 candidate genes associated with SARS were identified, including 21 correlated with COVID-19 aggressiveness. The two most significant pathways associated with all 437 genes (Caveolar-mediated Endocytosis and MSP-RON Signalling) did not show any segregation at the population level. However, the most significant canonical pathway associated with genes linked to COVID-19 aggressiveness, the Hepatic Fibrosis and Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation, showed population-specific segregation. Both the Spanish and Italian populations clustered together from the rest of Europe. This was also observed for the Finnish population but in the opposite direction. These results suggest some of the severe COVID-19 cases reported in Spain and Italy could be partially explained by a pre-existing liver condition (especially liver cancer) and\/or may lead to further COVID-19 related liver complications.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leire Moya","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology, Translational Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Samaneh Farashi","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology and Translational Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Suravajhala","author_inst":"Birla Institute of Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Panchadsaram Janaththani","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology and Translational Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jyotsna Batra","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology, Translational Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hamish Gibbs","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John W Edmunds","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ellen Klapper","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Noah Merin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bruce T Liang","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Raavi Gupta","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oral Alpan","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Derya Unutmaz","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.186122","rel_title":"Towards the design of multiepitope-based peptide vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.186122","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 is a current pandemic health threat especially for elderly patients with comorbidities. This respiratory disease is caused by a beta coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease can progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome that can be fatal. Currently, no specific drug or vaccine are available to combat this pandemic outbreak. Social distancing and lockdown have been enforced in many places worldwide. The spike protein of coronavirus 2 is essential for viral entry into host target cells via interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. This viral protein is considered a potential target for design and development of a drug or vaccine. Previously, we have reported several potential epitopes on coronavirus 2 spike protein with high antigenicity, low allergenicity and good stability against specified proteases. In the current study, we have constructed and evaluated a peptide vaccine from these potential epitopes by using in silico approach. This construct is predicted to have a protective immunogenicity, low allergenicity and good stability with minor structural flaws in model build. The population coverage of the used T-cells epitopes is believed to be high according to the employed restricted alleles. The vaccine construct can elicit efficient and long-lasting immune response as appeared through simulation analysis.

The CD4 helper cell responses were skewed predominantly toward a Th1 response in blood, lung, and lymph nodes, reflective of the interferon-rich cytokine environment following infection.

We have re-analyzed previous cryo-EM data combining 3D clustering approaches with ways to explore a continuous flexibility space based on 3D Principal Component Analysis. These advanced analyses revealed a concerted motion involving the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), and subdomain 1 and 2 (SD1 &amp; SD2) around the previously characterized 1-RBD-up state, which have been modeled as elastic deformations. We show that in this dataset there are not well-defined, stable, spike conformations, but virtually a continuum of states moving in a concerted fashion. We obtained an improved resolution ensemble map with minimum bias, from which we model by flexible fitting the extremes of the change along the direction of maximal variance. Moreover, a high-resolution structure of a recently described biochemically stabilized form of the spike is shown to greatly reduce the dynamics observed for the wild-type spike. Our results provide new detailed avenues to potentially restrain the spike dynamics for structure-based drug and vaccine design and at the same time give a warning of the potential image processing classification instability of these complicated datasets, having a direct impact on the interpretability of the results.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberto Melero","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Oscar S Sorzano","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Brent Foster","author_inst":"Dept. of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA"},{"author_name":"Jose Luis Vilas","author_inst":"Dept. of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Martinez","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Roberto Marabini","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Erney Ramirez-Aportela","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ruben Sanchez-Garcia","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"David Herreros","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Laura del Cano","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Patricia Losana","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Yunior C.

There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process. Here, we experimentally determined structural maps of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded RNA structures for SARS-CoV-2 and 6 other coronaviruses. Our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells. Importantly, we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep-learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, none of which were known previously. Thus, our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus RNA biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat COVID-19.HIGHLIGHTSWe mapped the in vivo structure and built secondary structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genomeWe discovered functionally impactful structural features in the RNA genomes of multiple coronavirusesWe predicted and validated host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome based on our in vivo RNA structural data using a deep-learning toolCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Sun","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pan Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Ju","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jian Rao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wenze Huang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Shaojun Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Tuanlin Xiong","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kui Xu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Zhou","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Lili Ren","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiangfeng Cliff Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wrapp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA"},{"author_name":"Pablo Chacon","author_inst":"Instituto Rocasolano-CSIC, c\/Serrano, 119, 28006, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jason S.

Only a single sequence was found to belong to lineage B. A mean of 6 nucleotide substitutions per viral genome was observed, without significant differences between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, indicating genetic drift as a major source for virus evolution. tMRCA estimation confirmed the probable origin of the epidemic between the end of January and the beginning of February with a rapid increase in the number of infections between the end of February and mid-March. Since early February, an effective reproduction number (Re) greater than 1 was estimated, which then increased reaching the peak of 2.3 in early March, confirming the circulation of the virus before the first COVID-19 cases were documented. Continuous use of state-of-the-art methods for molecular surveillance is warranted to trace virus circulation and evolution and inform effective prevention and containment of future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessia Lai","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Annalisa Bergna","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Sara Caucci","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Virology Unit, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy."},{"author_name":"Nicola Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Ilaria Vicenti","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy."},{"author_name":"Filippo Dragoni","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy."},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Cattelan","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria di Padova, Padua, Italy."},{"author_name":"Stefano Menzo","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Virology Unit, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Angelo Pan","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases, ASST Cremona, Cremona (MI), Italy."},{"author_name":"Annapaola Callegaro","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Laboratory, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adriano Tagliabracci","author_inst":"Section of Legal Medicine, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arnaldo Caruso","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Caccuri","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ronchiadin","author_inst":"Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center, AI LAB, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Balotta","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Maurizio Zazzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy."},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

A multi-omic approach was adopted, and in the discovery phase, global proteome\/metaproteome\/metabolome were analysed in the respiratory specimens of SARS-CoV-2 positive [n=20], negative [n=20], and H1N1 positive [n=5] cases. We identified MX1 (MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1) and WARS (Tryptophan--tRNA ligase) as clues to viral diagnosis and validated in 200 SARS-CoV-2 suspects. MX1 >30pg\/ml and WARS >25ng\/ml segregated virus positives patients [(AUC=94%CI(0.91-0.97)]. Distinct increase in SARS-CoV-2 induced immune activation, metabolic reprograming and a decrease in oxygen transport, wound healing, fluid regulation, vitamin and steroid metabolism was seen (p<0.05). Multi-omics profiling correlated with viraemia and segregated asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the multiomics approach identified increased respiratory pathogens [Burkholderiales, Klebsiella pneumonia] and decreased lactobacillus salivarius (FDR<0.05, p<0.05) in COVID-19 specimens. Conclusion: Novel proteins [MX1 and WARS] can rapidly and reliably diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify asymptomatic and mild disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaswinder Singh Maras","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shvetank Sharma","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Adil Rafiq Bhat","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reshu Aggarwal","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ekta Gupta","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Cattelan","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria di Padova, Padua, Italy."},{"author_name":"Stefano Menzo","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Virology Unit, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Angelo Pan","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases, ASST Cremona, Cremona (MI), Italy."},{"author_name":"Annapaola Callegaro","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Laboratory, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adriano Tagliabracci","author_inst":"Section of Legal Medicine, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arnaldo Caruso","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Caccuri","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ronchiadin","author_inst":"Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center, AI LAB, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Balotta","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Maurizio Zazzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy."},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

Design: Repeated cross-sectional surveys of population-representative households with longitudinal follow-up if consent given. Setting: England. Participants: 34,992 Individuals aged 2 years and over from 16,722 private residential households. Data were collected in a pilot phase of the survey between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Main outcome measures: Percentage of individuals in the community testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using throat and nose swabs. Individuals were asked about any symptoms and potential risk factors. Results: The percentage of people in private-residential households testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 reduced from 0.32% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.19% to 0.52%) on 26 April to 0.08% (95% CrI 0.05% to 0.12%) on 28 June, although the prevalence stabilised near the end of the pilot. Factors associated with an increased risk of testing positive included having a job with direct patient contact (relative exposure (RE) 4.06, 95% CrI 2.42 to 6.77)), working outside the home (RE 2.49, 95% CrI 1.39 to 4.45), and having had contact with a hospital (RE 2.20, 95% CrI 1.09 to 4.16 for having been to a hospital individually and RE 1.95, 95% CrI 0.81 to 4.09 for a household member having been to a hospital). In 133 visits where individuals tested positive, 82 (61%, 95% CrI 53% to 69%) reported no symptoms, stably over time. Conclusion: The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals declined between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported. Working outside your home was an important risk factor, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be essential for early detection of increases in infections following return to work and other relaxations of control measures.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Koen B Pouwels","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas House","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Julie V Robotham","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Paul Birrell","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andrew B Gelman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Nikola Bowers","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Ian Boreham","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Heledd Thomas","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"James Lewis","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Iain Bell","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"John I Bell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Newton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Farrar","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Pete Benton","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Sarah Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

While active surveillance throughout the semester such as widespread testing, contact tracing, and case isolation, may assist in detecting and preventing early outbreaks, these strategies will not be sufficient should a larger outbreak occur. It is therefore necessary to limit the initial number of active cases at the start of the semester. We examine the impact of pre-semester NAT testing on disease spread in a university setting. Methods: We implement simple dynamic transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to explore the effects of pre-semester testing strategies on the number of active infections and occupied isolation beds throughout the semester. We assume an infectious period of 3 days and vary R0 to represent the effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies throughout the semester. We assume the prevalence of active cases at the beginning of the semester is 5%. The sensitivity of the NAT test is set at 90%. Results: If no pre-semester screening is mandated, the peak number of active infections occurs in under 10 days and the size of the peak is substantial, ranging from 5,000 active infections when effective mitigation strategies (R0 = 1.25) are implemented to over 15,000 active infections for less effective strategies (R0 = 3). When one NAT test is mandated within one week of campus arrival, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak to 40 days and 17 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. When two NAT tests are mandated, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak through the end of fall semester and 20 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from less than 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. If maximum occupancy of isolation beds is set to 2% of the student population, then isolation beds would only be available for a range of 1 in 2 confirmed cases (R0 = 1.25) to 1 in 40 confirmed cases (R0 = 3) before maximum occupancy is reached. Conclusion: Even with highly effective mitigation strategies throughout the semester, inadequate pre-semester testing will lead to early and large surges of the disease and result in universities quickly reaching their isolation bed capacity. We therefore recommend NAT testing within one week of campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the outbreak, pre-semester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to reduce the outbreak size.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lior Rennert","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Corey Andrew Kalbaugh","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Lu Shi","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Christopher McMahan","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Andrew B Gelman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Nikola Bowers","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Ian Boreham","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Heledd Thomas","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"James Lewis","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Iain Bell","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"John I Bell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Newton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Farrar","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Pete Benton","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Sarah Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

Acute cardiac related injury (ACRI) is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Objective: To explain the pathological mechanism of ACRI and improve the treatment strategy by retrospectively observing the factors associated with ACRI and factors affecting the prognosis of ACRI with COVID-19 at an early stage. Methods: 619 COVID-19 patients were from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. T test was used for continuous variables while Chi-square test for categorical factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Among the 619 OOS Level-I hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 102 (16.5%) were defined as ACRI (stage-1: 59 cases, stage-2: 43 cases). 50% of ACRI patients developed into severe cases and 25 patients died (CFR=24.5%), 42 times that of non-ACRI patients. Elderly (OR=2.83, P<0.001) , HTN (OR=2.09, P=0.005), {gamma}-globulin (OR=2.08, P=0.004), TCM (OR=0.55, P=0.017), PLT (OR=2.94, P<0.001) and NLR (OR=2.20, P=0.004) were independently correlated with ACRI. SBP[&ge;]140, dyspnea, DM, smoking history were correlated with ACRI-stage2 only. In the prognostic subgroup analysis of ACRI patients,{gamma}-globulin treatment could prolong LOS. TCM (OR=0.26, P=0.006), SBP[&ge;]160 (OR= 22.70, P=0.005), male (OR=2.66, P=0.044) were associated with severe illness while corticosteroids treatment (OR=3.34, P=0.033) and male (OR=4.303, P=0.008) with death. Surprisingly, we found the mortality of non-elderly patients is higher than elderly (32.4% VS 20.0%, P=0.164), and both IKF and RASI treatment were not correlated with any prognostic indicators including severe, death and LOS. Conclusion: This study observed that several non-traditional issues were associated with early cardiac injury in COVID-19 while many traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not. Besides elderly and male, hypertension was confirmed to be the most important risk factor.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Xie","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sichun Chen","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xueli Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Central China Development, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Baige Li","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Tianlu Zhang","author_inst":"zhangtianlu99@163.com"},{"author_name":"Xingwei He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"NingLing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Hypertension at Heart Center, People's Hospital, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Luyan Wang","author_inst":"Heart Center, Peking University Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hesong Zeng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Eye Center, Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"John I Bell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Newton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Farrar","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Pete Benton","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Sarah Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

Since its identification, the COVID-19 infection has caused substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide, but sub-Saharan Africa seems to defy the predictions. We aimed to verify this hypothesis using strong statistical methods. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing the projected and actual numbers as well as population proportions of COVID-19 cases in the 46 sub-Saharan African countries on May 1st, May 29th (4 weeks later) and June 26th (8 weeks later). The source of the projected number of cases was a publication by scientists from the Center for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, whereas the actual number of cases was obtained from the WHO situation reports. We calculated the percentage difference between the projected and actual numbers of cases per country. Further, N-1 chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the projected and actual population proportion of COVID-19 cases, along with the 95% confidence interval of the difference between these population proportions. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with 0.05 used as threshold for statistical significance. Results. On May 1st, May 29th and June 26th, respectively 40 (86.95%), 45 (97.82%) and 41 (89.13%) of the sub-Saharan African countries reported a number of confirmed cases that was lower than the predicted number of 1000 cases for May 1st and 10000 for both May 29th and June 26th. At these dates, the population proportions of confirmed Covid-19 cases were significantly lower (p-value <0.05) than the projected proportions of cases. Across all these dates, South-Africa always exceeded the predicted number and population proportion of COVID-19 infections. Conclusion. Sub-Saharan African countries did defy the dire predictions of the COVID-19 burden. Preventive measures should be further enforced to preserve this positive outcome.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fokoua Maxime Christophe Dongmo","author_inst":"University of New York State - University at Albany School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amor Ndjabo Monique","author_inst":"School of Health Sciences, Catholic University of Central Africa, Yaounde, Cameroon"},{"author_name":"Ankobil Amandus","author_inst":"University of New York State - University at Albany School of Public Health, Albany, USA"},{"author_name":"Kiyung Victor Momah","author_inst":"School of Health Sciences, Catholic University of Central Africa, Yaounde, Cameroon"},{"author_name":"Metomb Franck Steve","author_inst":"Regional Delegation of Public Health for the Center Region, Ministry of Public Health, Yaounde, Cameroon"},{"author_name":"Choukem Simeon Pierre","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine and Specialties, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon"},{"author_name":"NingLing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Hypertension at Heart Center, People's Hospital, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Luyan Wang","author_inst":"Heart Center, Peking University Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hesong Zeng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Eye Center, Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"John I Bell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Newton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Farrar","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Pete Benton","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Sarah Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

Meta-analyses and meta-regressions approaches were applied to official public data reported by the Word Health Organization and governments until May, 2020. A random effect model was used for the meta-analysis and heterogeneity was calculated by I2 statistic. There was not significative difference between men and women to be infected by COVID-19 (P = 0.42), though a significative difference was observed for death rate (P < 0.0001).

By combining cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical experiments, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds to the human 40S subunit in ribosomal complexes including the 43S pre-initiation complex. The protein inserts its C-terminal domain at the entrance to the mRNA channel where it interferes with mRNA binding. We observe potent translation inhibition in the presence of Nsp1 in lysates from human cells. Based on the high-resolution structure of the 40S-Nsp1 complex, we identify residues of Nsp1 crucial for mediating translation inhibition. We further show that the full-length 5\u2019 untranslated region of the genomic viral mRNA stimulates translation in vitro, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 combines inhibition of translation by Nsp1 with efficient translation of the viral mRNA to achieve expression of viral genes3.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katharina Schubert","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Institute of Molecular Biology and Biophysics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Evangelos D.

While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, ~30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to locate regions of high base pair content across this long genome and also identify well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity to stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most highly structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis reveals varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts. The conclusions reported in this study provide a foundation for structure-function hypotheses in SARS-CoV-2 biology, and in turn, may guide the 3D structural characterization of potential RNA drug targets for COVID-19 therapeutics.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael de Cesaris Araujo Tavares","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Gandhar Mahadeshwar","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Anna Marie Pyle","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology & Department of Chemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute"},{"author_name":"Na Young Kim","author_inst":"ABION Inc., R&D Center"},{"author_name":"Euni Sim","author_inst":"ABION Inc., R&D Center"},{"author_name":"Jun Young Choi","author_inst":"ABION Inc., R&D Center"},{"author_name":"Dong Hyun Song","author_inst":"Agency for Defense Development"},{"author_name":"Gyeung Haeng Hur","author_inst":"Agency for Defense Development"},{"author_name":"Young Kee Shin","author_inst":"College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Seong Tae Jeong","author_inst":"Agency for Defense Development"},{"author_name":"John I Bell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Newton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Farrar","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Pete Benton","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Sarah Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

When treatment was initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir had a strong dose effect, leading to dramatic reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlated with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. The antiviral efficacy observed in this study was achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials and was associated with weight losses in animals.

In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection.

These data sets include sequencing libraries from clinically isolated samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and healthy controls.

To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication\/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication\/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPrinciple of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis detection by a fluorescence-based high throughput screening assay\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/192005v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8122dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18557org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d95362org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f15222_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- A new SARS-CoV non radioactive RNA polymerase assay is described\n- The robotized assay is suitable to identify RdRp inhibitors based on HTS","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cecilia Eydoux","author_inst":"AMU"},{"author_name":"Veronique Fattorini","author_inst":"CNRS-AMU"},{"author_name":"Ashleigh Shannon","author_inst":"CNRS-AMU"},{"author_name":"Thi-Tuyet-Nhung Le","author_inst":"CNRS-AMU"},{"author_name":"Bruno Didier","author_inst":"Univ.

This is not a universal sarbecovirus trait; for example, many known sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-1 have two deletions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that render them incapable of using human ACE2. Further, we report three novel sarbecoviruses from Rwanda and Uganda which are phylogenetically intermediate to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate via in vitro studies that they are also unable to utilize human ACE2. Here, we show that recombination is most likely responsible for the observed patterns of ACE2 usage among sarbecoviruses. We show that the lineage that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the progenitor of SARS-CoV-1 at some time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less parsimonious, show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a recombination scenario, and propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this recombination event could have been evolutionarily advantageous. The findings from this study provide important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses. This study also underscores the need for increased surveillance for sarbecoviruses in southwestern China, where ACE2-using viruses have been found to date, as well as other regions including Africa, where these viruses have only recently been discovered.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Heather L Wells","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Michael C Letko","author_inst":"NIH\/NIAID"},{"author_name":"Gorka Lasso","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Benard Ssebide","author_inst":"Gorilla Doctors, Wildlife Health Institute, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Julius Nziza","author_inst":"Gorilla Doctors, Wildlife Health Institute, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Denis K Byarugaba","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Veterinary Medicine"},{"author_name":"Isamara Navarrete-Macias","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Eliza Liang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Michael Cranfield","author_inst":"One Health Institute, Wildlife Health Center, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Barbara A Han","author_inst":"Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies"},{"author_name":"Morgan W Tingley","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Maria Diuk-Wasser","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Tracey Goldstein","author_inst":"One Health Institute, Wildlife Health Center, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Christine Kreuder Johnson","author_inst":"One Health Institute, Wildlife Health Center, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Jonna Mazet","author_inst":"One Health Institute, Wildlife Health Center, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Kartik Chandran","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Gilardi","author_inst":"One Health Institute, Wildlife Health Center, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Simon J Anthony","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.
