Since people are in tremor due to the massive spread of Coronavirus in the major parts of the world, it requires to predict the risk of this infectious disease. In this situation, we develop a model to measure the risk of infectious disease and predict the risk of 2019-nCOV transmission by using data of four countries - United States, Australia, Canada and China. Methods The model underlies that higher the population density, higher the risk of transmission of infectious disease from human to human. Besides, population size, case identification rate and travel of infected passengers in different regions are also incorporated in this model. Results According to the calculated risk index, our study identifies New York State in United States (US) to be the most vulnerable area affected by the novel Coronavirus. Besides, other areas (province\/state\/territory) such as Hubei (China, 2nd), Massachusetts (US, 3rd), District of Columbia (US, 4th), New Jersey (US, 5th), Quebec (Canada, 20th), Australian Capital Territory (Australia, 29th) are also found as the most risky areas in US, China, Australia and Canada. Conclusion The study suggests avoiding any kind of mass gathering, maintaining recommended physical distances and restricting inbound and outbound flights of highly risk prone areas for tackling 2019-nCOV transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore brought together previously established disease modeling estimates of the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various social distancing contact reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care surge response across all US counties. Methods Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand and medical system critical care supply were calculated for all continental US counties. These estimates were statistically summarized and mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. Estimates of COVID-19 infections and patients needing critical care were calculated from March 24, 2020 to April 24, 2020 for three different estimated population levels - 0%, 25%, and 50% - of contact reduction (through actions such as social distancing). Multiple national public and private datasets were linked and harmonized in order to calculate county-level critical care bed counts that included currently available beds and those that could be made available under four surge response scenarios - very low, low, medium, and high - as well as excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care. Results Surge response scenarios ranged from a very low total supply 77,588 critical care beds to a high total of 278,850 critical care beds. Over the four week study period, excess deaths from inaccessible critical care ranged from 24,688 in the very low response scenario to 13,268 in the high response scenario. Northeastern and urban counties were projected to be most affected by excess deaths due to critical care shortages, and counties in New York, Colorado, and Virginia were projected to exceed their critical care bed limits despite high levels of COVID-19 contact reduction. Over the four week study period, an estimated 12,203-19,594 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through greater preventive actions such as travel restrictions, publicly imposed contact precautions, greater availability of rapid testing for COVID-19, social distancing, self-isolation when sick, and similar interventions. An estimated 4,029-11,420 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through aggressive critical care surge response and preparations, including high clearance of ICU and non-ICU critical care beds and extraordinary measures like using a single ventilator for multiple patients. Conclusions Unless the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases is flattened over an extended period of time, the US COVID-19 epidemic will cause a shortage of critical care beds and drive up otherwise preventable deaths. The findings here support value of preventive actions to flatten the epidemic curve, as well as the value of exercising extraordinary surge capacity measures to increase access to hospital critical care for severely ill COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charles C Branas","author_inst":"Gelman Professor of Epidemiology and Chair, Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rundle","author_inst":"Associate Professor of Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"},{"author_name":"Sen Pei","author_inst":"Associate Research Scientist, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"},{"author_name":"Wan Yang","author_inst":"Assistant Professor of Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"},{"author_name":"Brendan G Carr","author_inst":"Chair, Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Health System, NY, NY; Senior Advisor and Director, Emergency Care Coordination C"},{"author_name":"Sarah Sims","author_inst":"CEO, Patient Insight, Santa Monica, CA; Research Contractor, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, US Department of Health and Human "},{"author_name":"Alexis Zebrowski","author_inst":"Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Health System, NY, NY"},{"author_name":"Ronan Doorley","author_inst":"Research Contractor, Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Neil Schluger","author_inst":"Chief, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Professor of Medicine, Epidemiology and Environmental Health Sciences, Columbia University Irv"},{"author_name":"James W Quinn","author_inst":"Staff Associate, Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Professor, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20051052","rel_title":"Global epidemiology, pathogenesis, immune response, diagnosis, treatment, economic and psychological impact, challenges, and future prevention of COVID-19: A scoping review","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20051052","rel_abs":"Background: Globally, the novel coronavirus, is a public health problem causing respiratory infections. Since the outbreak of severe acute and Middle East respiratory syndromes coronavirus was not reported to cause human infections. Now, it become an epidemic proportion with growing number of cases and deaths. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework. In this scoping review, 50 records published before 28 March, 2020 were included and discussed to better understand the current epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunological response, diagnosis, evasion mechanisms and suggested strategies to boost the immune system, challenges, treatment, and future preventions of the virus. PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, Global Health and google scholars were searched comprehensively for articles, preprints, grey literatures, reports, websites, conference proceedings and expert information. Studies conducted in human and published in the English language were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements of the review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in citations. Results: We identified 360 records, of which 50 studies met the inclusion criteria. We synthesized the data from the included records and dig out the deep insights of them and pooled into this review. The burden of the outbreak is worsening due to overcrowding, presence of asymptomatic carriers, scarcity of test kits, the immune escaping ability of the virus and lack of awareness. Conclusions and recommendations: Due to the fast-spreading nature of COVID-19 the prevention and control strategies become challenging. It is imposing social, psychological, and socio-economic impacts. We recommended that following social distancing, isolation suspects, using personal protective equipment, health education and introducing handwashing practices, avoiding contact with animals, vaccine development and treatment for controlling and prevention.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brhane Berhe","author_inst":"Adigrat University, Collegeof HealthSciences"},{"author_name":"Haftom Legese","author_inst":"Adigrat University, College of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hagos Degefa","author_inst":"Adigrat University, College of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gebre Adhanom","author_inst":"Adigrat University, College of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Aderajew Gebrewahd","author_inst":"Adigrat University, College of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fitsum Mardu","author_inst":"Adigrat University, College of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kebede Tesfay","author_inst":"Adigrat University, College of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miglas Welay","author_inst":"Adigrat University, College of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hadush Negash","author_inst":"Adigrat University, College of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"James W Quinn","author_inst":"Staff Associate, Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Professor, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20050203","rel_title":"Seeding COVID-19 across sub-Saharan Africa: an analysis of reported importation events across 40 countries","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20050203","rel_abs":"Background: The first case of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was reported by Nigeria on February 27, 2020. While case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, SSA countries remain vulnerable to COVID morbidity and mortality due to systemic healthcare weaknesses, less financial resources and infrastructure to address the new crisis, and untreated comorbidities. Variation in preparedness and response capacity as well as in data availability has raised concerns about undetected transmission events. Methods: Confirmed cases reported by SSA countries were line-listed to capture epidemiological details related to early transmission events into and within countries. Data were retrieved from publicly available sources, including institutional websites, situation reports, press releases, and social media accounts, with supplementary details obtained from news articles. A data availability score was calculated for each imported case in terms of how many indicators (sex, age, travel history, date of arrival in country, reporting date of confirmation, and how detected) could be identified. We assessed the relationship between time to first importation and overall Global Health Security Index (GHSI) using Cox regression. K-means clustering grouped countries according to healthcare capacity and health and demographic risk factors. Results A total of 13,201 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported by 48 countries in SSA during the 54 days following the first known introduction to the region. Out of the 2516 cases for which travel history information was publicly available, 1129 (44.9%) were considered importation events. At the regional level, imported cases tended to be male (65.0%), were a median 41.0 years old (Range: 6 weeks - 88 years), and most frequently had recent travel history from Europe (53.1%). The median time to reporting an introduction was 19 days; a country's time to report its first importation was not related to GHSI, after controlling for air traffic. Countries that had, on average, the highest case fatality rates, lowest healthcare capacity, and highest probability of premature death due to non-communicable diseases were among the last to report any cases. Conclusions: Countries with systemic, demographic, and pre-existing health vulnerabilities to severe COVID-related morbidity and mortality are less likely to report any cases or may be reporting with limited public availability of information. Reporting on COVID detection and response efforts, as well as on trends in non-COVID illness and care-seeking behavior, is critical to assessing direct and indirect consequences and capacity needs in resource- constrained settings. Such assessments aid in the ability to make data-driven decisions about interventions, country priorities, and risk assessment.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura A Skrip","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Brittany Hagedorn","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Andre Lin Ou\u00e9draogo","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Navideh Noori","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Dina Mistry","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Jamie Bedson","author_inst":"Consultant to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Laurent H\u00e9bert-Dufresne","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Muir Althouse","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Professor, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20050138","rel_title":"Epidemiological Characteristics of COVID-19: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20050138","rel_abs":"Background: Our understanding of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to evolve. However, there are many unknowns about its epidemiology. Purpose: To synthesize the number of deaths from confirmed COVID-19 cases, incubation period, as well as time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first medical visit, ICU admission, recovery and death of COVID-19. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019 through to March 11, 2020 without language restrictions as well as bibliographies of relevant articles. Study Selection: Quantitative studies that recruited people living with or died due to COVID-19. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Conflicts were resolved through discussion with a senior author. Data Synthesis: Out of 1675 non-duplicate studies identified, 57 were included. Pooled mean incubation period was 5.84 (99% CI: 4.83, 6.85) days. Pooled mean number of days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first clinical visit was 4.82 (95% CI: 3.48, 6.15), ICU admission was 10.48 (95% CI: 9.80, 11.16), recovery was 17.76 (95% CI: 12.64, 22.87), and until death was 15.93 (95% CI: 13.07, 18.79). Pooled probability of COVID-19-related death was 0.02 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.03). Limitations: Studies are observational and findings are mainly based on studies that recruited patient from clinics and hospitals and so may be biased toward more severe cases. Conclusion: We found that the incubation period and lag between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 is longer than other respiratory viral infections including MERS and SARS; however, the current policy of 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone might be too conservative. Longer quarantine periods might be more justified for extreme cases.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malahat Khalili","author_inst":"Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Karamouzian","author_inst":"University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Naser Nasiri","author_inst":"Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran"},{"author_name":"Sara Javadi","author_inst":"Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran"},{"author_name":"Ali Mirzazadeh","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hamid Sharifi","author_inst":"Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran"},{"author_name":"Jamie Bedson","author_inst":"Consultant to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Laurent H\u00e9bert-Dufresne","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Muir Althouse","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Professor, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20050781","rel_title":"Synchronized travel restrictions across cities can be effective in COVID-19 control","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20050781","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 outbreak is under control in China.

Assess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which (pre-outbreak) factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as (pre-outbreak) respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital status and education level. Methods. Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample=3,540). Results. About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratios [aOR] smaller than .058). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.27-1.69). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.46-0.69). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR=2.89, 95% CI=2.24-3.73), heart problems (aOR=2.17, 95% CI=1.49-3.16) and diabetes (aOR=3.10, 95% CI=2.02-4.74) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. Conclusions. Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, men and those with lower education levels.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter G. van der Velden","author_inst":"CentERdata, Tilburg, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Miquelle Marchand","author_inst":"CentERdata, Tilburg, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Boukje Cuelenaere","author_inst":"CentERdata, Tilburg, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marcel Das","author_inst":"CentERdata, Tilburg, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Zeyu Liang","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yue Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jamie Bedson","author_inst":"Consultant to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Laurent H\u00e9bert-Dufresne","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Muir Althouse","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Professor, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20049981","rel_title":"Sustainable social distancing through facemask use and testing during the Covid-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20049981","rel_abs":"We investigate how individual protective behaviors, different levels of testing, and isolation influence the transmission and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study explored the equivalency of patient-collected tongue, anterior nares (nasal), and mid-turbinate (MT) samples to health care worker-collected NP samples for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients presenting to five urgent care facilities with symptoms indicative of an upper respiratory infection provided self-collected samples from three anatomic sites along with a health care worker-collected NP sample. Using NP as the comparator, sensitivities and one-sided 95% confidence intervals for the tongue, nasal, and MT samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were calculated. Results: The sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient-collected tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate samples was 89.8% (95% CI: 80.2 -100.0), 94.0 (95% CI: 84.6-100.0) and 96.2 (95% CI: 87.7-100.0), respectively. Among samples yielding positive results, cycle threshold (Ct) values (a measure of viral load) had correlation coefficients of 0.48, 0.78, and 0.86 between the NP samples and the tongue, nasal, and MT samples, respectively. Conclusions: Patient-collected nasal and MT samples demonstrated high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection using health care worker-collected NP samples as the comparator. Among patients testing positive with NP samples, nasal and MT Ct values demonstrated high correlations with those Ct values of the NP samples. Patient-collected nasal or MT sampling may improve efficiency for COVID-19 testing while reducing the risk of exposure of the health workforce.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuan-Po Tu","author_inst":"The Everett Clinic, Optum"},{"author_name":"Rachel Jennings","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research & Development"},{"author_name":"Brian Hart","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research & Development"},{"author_name":"Gerald Cangelosi","author_inst":"Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rachel Wood","author_inst":"Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wehber","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research & Development"},{"author_name":"Prateek Verma","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Ethan M Berke","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research & Development"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Muir Althouse","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Professor, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20051029","rel_title":"Therapeutic Management of COVID-19 Patients: A systematic review","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20051029","rel_abs":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the COVID-19 that has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO in 2020.

If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. The aim of this study is to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity or reduce length of stay. Methods A stochastic discrete event simulation model is developed to represent the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. Model inputs are aligned to levers available to planners with key outputs including duration of time at maximum capacity (to inform workforce requirements), peak daily deaths (for mortuary planning), and total deaths (as an ultimate marker of intervention efficacy). The model - freely available - is applied to the COVID-19 response at a large hospital in England for which the effect of a number of possible interventions are simulated. Results Capacity-dependent deaths are closely associated with both the nature and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and availability of intensive care beds. For the hospital considered, results suggest that capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced five-fold through a combination of isolation policies, a doubling of bed capacity, and 25% reduced length of stay. Conclusions Without treatment or vaccination there is little that can be done to reduce deaths occurring when patients have otherwise been treated in the most appropriate hospital setting. Healthcare planners should therefore focus on minimising the capacity-dependent deaths that are within their influence.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard M Wood","author_inst":"UK National Health Service and University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Christopher J McWilliams","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Thomas","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Christopher P Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Christos Vasilakis","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Azhar Kamal","author_inst":"Assistant Professor, 1-Department of Biochemistry College of Science University of Jeddah,  Jeddah, Saudi Arabia 2-Centre for Science and Medical Research (UJC-"},{"author_name":"Nawal Helmi","author_inst":"Assistant Professor, 1- Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, College of Applied Medical Sciences, University of Jeddah  2- Department of Biochemistry, C"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Ethan M Berke","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research & Development"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Muir Althouse","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Professor, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, NY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20050773","rel_title":"Exponential phase of covid19 expansion is not driven by climate at global scale","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20050773","rel_abs":"The pandemic state of COVID-19 caused by the SARS CoV-2 put the world in quarantine, led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and is causing an unprecedented economic crisis.

As a result, epidemiological models are being used to inform policy on how to effectively deal with this pandemic. The majority of existing models assume random diffusion but do not take into account differences in the amount of interactions between individuals, i.e. the underlying human interaction network, whose structure is known to be scale-free. Here, we demonstrate how this network of interactions can be used to predict the spread of the virus and to inform policy on the most successful mitigation and suppression strategies. Using stochastic simulations in a scale-free network, we show that the epidemic can propagate for a long time at a low level before the number of infected individuals suddenly increases markedly, and that this increase occurs shortly after the first hub is infected. We further demonstrate that mitigation strategies that target hubs are far more effective than strategies that randomly decrease the number of connections between individuals. Although applicable to infectious disease modelling in general, our results emphasize how network science can improve the predictive power of current COVID-19 epidemiological models.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Helena A Herrmann","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Schwartz","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Kadry Ali Ezzat Jr.","author_inst":"Higher Technological Institute, Biomedical Engineering Department"},{"author_name":"Haytham H.

Outpatient Fever Clinics (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were upgraded to provide COVID-19 screening and prevention attached to large tertiary hospitals. We sought to analyze the effect of upgraded FCs to detecting COVID-19 at our institution. Design: A population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 6,365 patients were screened in the FC. Methods: The FC of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) was upgraded on January 20, 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between December 12, 2019 to February 29, 2020, covering a period of 40 days before and after upgrading the FC. All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow-up conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed. Results: 6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p<0.001]. For critically-ill patients waiting for a screening result, the total length of stay in the FC was 22mins before the outbreak, compared to 442mins after the outbreak (p< 0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critical-care patients seen first in the FC was 9 of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 of 38 after (p<0.050). Nineteen COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the FC, but no other patients or medical care providers were cross-infected. Conclusion: The work-load of the FC increased after the COVID-19 outbreak and effectively prevented COVID-19 from spreading in the hospital as well as offload ED resources.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiangshan Wang","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liang Zong Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Zhang Sr.","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Han Sun Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Walline Harold Joseph Sr.","author_inst":"Accident and Emergency Medicine Academic Unit, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Pengxia Sun","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengyong Xu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunting Wang","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jihai Liu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Xu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuezhong Yu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huadong Zhu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20043992","rel_title":"Anxiety, worry and perceived stress in the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic, March 2020.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19: a public health emergency of international concern. Having into consideration the lockdown and quarantine situation, we decided to do evaluate the current emotional state on the general population with a web-based survey in English and in Spanish, which was considered a useful and fast method that could help us determine how people perceived stress and worry due to the COVID-19. Methods: The survey included a 22 items, gathering information in 3 sections: Sociodemographic data, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) by Cohen and additional queries that assessed the current worry and change of behaviours due to this pandemic. Results: The survey received 891 respondents from 25 countries, from March 17 to 23rd, 2020. The mean age of the respondents was 43.8 (14.2) years old, and more than two thirds were women. 12.8% were health personnel.The mean of the PSS-10 score was 17.4 (6.4). Significantly higher scores were observed among women, youth, students, and among those who expressed concern and those who perceived increased susceptibility to the COVID-19. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the health professionals and the general population. A good correlation was observed between mean relative volume (RSV) of the las 14 days and the number of cases reported (rho = 0.68, p <0.001) and deaths (rho = 0.51, p <0.001).

Object: Support for policymaking requires forecasting of the entire course and outcome of the outbreak if a self-restraint in going out is not initiated. Moreover, the effects of a self-restraint in going out must be considered when choosing to initiate one. Method: Data of Tokyo patients with symptoms during January 14 - March 28, 2020 were used to formulate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model using three age classes and to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0). Based on the estimated R0, We inferred outbreak outcomes and medical burden if a self-restraint in going out were not enacted. Then we estimate the self-restraint in going out effects. Results: Results suggest R0 as 2.86, with a 95% confidence interval of [2.73, 2.97]. Exhaustion of medical resources can be expected to occur on April 26 if no self-restraint in going out occurs. If a self-restraint in going out were enacted from April 6, and if more than 60% of trips outside the home were restricted voluntarily, then medical care service could be maintained. Discussion and Conclusion: The estimated R0 was similar to that found from other studies conducted in China and Japan. Results demonstrate that a self-restraint in going out with reasonable cooperation of residents is required to maintain medical care.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junko Kurita","author_inst":"Department of Nursig, Tokiwa University, Ibaraki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Tamie Sugawara","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Ohkusa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Anne Drewry","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Roger Bedimo","author_inst":"VA North Texas Health Care System and UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Erik Kulstad","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shengyong Xu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunting Wang","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jihai Liu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Xu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuezhong Yu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huadong Zhu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20047373","rel_title":"Frequency of testing for COVID 19 infection and the presence of higher number of available beds per country predict outcomes with the infection, not the GDP of the country - A descriptive statistical analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20047373","rel_abs":"Introduction: The novel coronavirus epidemic which originated in late 2019 from China has wreaked havoc on millions across the world with illness, death and socioeconomic recession. As of now no valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved worldwide and governments across the world have been forced to take the draconian step of social isolation in communities by enforcing lockdowns. Aim of this Study: This study aims to correlate the rates of infection with the novel coronavirus and total deaths as the primary output variable. In addition the strength of association between infection rates and total death in comparison to GDP share of the respective countries, physicians, hospital beds and rates of testing for COVID 19 infection per thousand patients, is being assessed, in a bid to develop a model which would help to develop tools to reduce the impact of this disease. Material & Methods Data relating to number of cases, severity, cases recovered and deaths worldwide and specifically for the top six countries affected was collected from the WHO COVID-19 situation report which is being updated on a daily basis till 22nd March 2020, the date of analysis. Additional data related to GDP, physician and hospital bed per 1000 patients were procured from the World Bank database. All data were collected in a file in CSV format. Analysis was conducted in Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 software and also with XL-Stat statistical software for excel. The analytical strategy was descriptive with no inferential overtones. Results: COVID 19 infection strongly correlates with total deaths (r : 0.89), with a predicted death rate of 25 patients per 1000 affected. There was no correlation between the GDP growth of the country and number of treating physicians\/1000 patient population with any COVID 19 related outcome. However there was a negative correlation between COVID 19-related deaths and the number of beds available per 1000 population [r=-0.34]. Importantly there is an inverse correlation between the number of tests conducted per million population with the rates of active infections [r=-0.12] , new cases [r=-0.38] and new deaths [r=-0.28] in COVID 19. Conclusion: This is the first study to assess parameters other than age and sex and sets out a robust dataset which indicates an increased risk of worsening outcomes with lesser number of beds and testing, suggesting that the need of the hour is to increase available bed numbers and to increase rates of testing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SAMIT GHOSAL","author_inst":"Nightingale Hospital"},{"author_name":"Binayak Sinha","author_inst":"AMRI Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sumit Sengupta","author_inst":"AMRI Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Milan Majumder","author_inst":"Independent Biostatistician"},{"author_name":"Roger Bedimo","author_inst":"VA North Texas Health Care System and UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Erik Kulstad","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shengyong Xu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunting Wang","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jihai Liu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Xu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuezhong Yu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huadong Zhu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20051722","rel_title":"Urinalysis, but not blood biochemistry, detects the early renal-impairment in patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20051722","rel_abs":"Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused infectious disease, termed COVID-19, outbroke in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 patients manifested as lung injury with complications in other organs, such as liver, heart, gastrointestinal tract, especially for severe cases. However, whether COVID-19 causes significant acute kidney injury (AKI) remained controversial. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, urine and blood routine tests and other laboratory parameters of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Union Hospital. Findings: 178 patients, admitted to Wuhan Union hospital from February 02 to February 29, 2020, were included in this study. No patient (0 [0%]) presented increased serum creatinine (Scr), and 5 (2.8%) patients showed increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating few cases with kidney dysfunction. However, for patients (83) with no history of kidney disease who received routine urine test upon hospitalization, 45 (54.2%) patients displayed abnormality in urinalysis, such as proteinuria, hematuria and leukocyturia, while none of the patients was recorded to have acute kidney injury (AKI) throughout the study. Meanwhile, the patients with abnormal urinalysis usually had worse disease progression reflecting by laboratory parameters presentations, including markers of liver injury, inflammation, and coagulation. Conclusion: Many patients manifested by abnormal urinalysis on admission, including proteinuria or hematuria. Our results revealed that urinalysis is better in unveiling potential kidney impairment of COVID-19 patients than blood chemistry test and urinalysis could be used to reflect and predict the disease severity. We therefore recommend pay more attention in urinalysis and kidney impairment in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haifeng zhou Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zili Zhang Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Fan Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junyi Li Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mingyue Li Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yalan Dong Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Weina Guo Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lan Lin Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhenyu Kang Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ting Yu Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chunxia Tian Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Gui Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Renjie Qin Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Haijun Wang Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"ShanShan Luo Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Desheng Hu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"urology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20047977","rel_title":"ACE2 variants underlie interindividual variability and susceptibility to COVID-19 in Italian population","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20047977","rel_abs":"In December 2019, an initial cluster of interstitial bilateral pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China. A human-to-human transmission was assumed and a previously unrecognized entity, termed coronavirus-disease-19 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was described. The infection has rapidly spread out all over the world and Italy has been the first European country experiencing the endemic wave with unexpected clinical severity in comparison with Asian countries. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as host receptor and host proteases for cell surface binding and internalization. Thus, a predisposing genetic background can give reason for inter-individual disease susceptibility and\/or severity. Taking advantage of the Network of Italian Genomes (NIG), here we mined whole-exome-sequencing data of 6930 Italian control individuals from five different centers looking for ACE2 variants. A number of variants with a potential impact on protein stability were identified. Among these, three more common missense changes, p.(Asn720Asp), p.(Lys26Arg), p.(Gly211Arg) were predicted to interfere with protein structure and stabilization. Rare variants likely interfering with the internalization process, namely p.(Leu351Val) and p.(Pro389His), predicted to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding, were also observed. Comparison of ACE2 WES data between a cohort of 131 patients and 258 controls allowed identifying a statistically significant (P value <0,029) higher allelic variability in controls compared to patients. These findings suggest that a predisposing genetic background may contribute to the observed inter-individual clinical variability associated with COVID-19, allowing an evidence-based risk assessment leading to personalized preventive measures and therapeutic options.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisa Benetti","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Rossella Tita","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese"},{"author_name":"Ottavia Spiga","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ciolfi","author_inst":"Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Roma"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Birolo","author_inst":"University of Turin, Turin"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bruselles","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Doddato","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Annarita Giliberti","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Cterina Marconi","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Musacchia","author_inst":"Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine, Pozzuoli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Pippucci","author_inst":"Sant Orsola Malpighi University Hospital, Bologna"},{"author_name":"Annalaura Torella","author_inst":"University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Caserta, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Trezza","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Floriana Valentino","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Mrgherita Baldassarri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Brusco","author_inst":"University of Turin"},{"author_name":"Rosanna Asselta","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Bruttini Mirella","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Marco Seri","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Nigro","author_inst":"University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Napoli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Matullo","author_inst":"University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Tartaglia","author_inst":"Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Mari","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Renieri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Annamaria Pinto","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20047530","rel_title":"Estimating Impact of Austerity policies in COVID-19 fatality rates:Examining the dynamics of economic policy and Case Fatality Rates (CFR) of COVID-19 in OCED countries","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20047530","rel_abs":"The paper will attempt to estimate factors which determine the variability of case fatality rates of COVID-19 across OECD countries in the recent time.

We used a planar beam of laser light passing through a dust-free enclosure to detect saliva droplets emitted while speaking. We found that saying the words 'Stay Healthy' generates thousands of droplets that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. A damp homemade cloth face mask dramatically reduced droplet excretion, with none of the spoken words causing a droplet rise above the background.

In this study, 11 key blood indices were extracted through random forest algorithm to build the final assistant discrimination tool from 49 clinical available blood test data which were derived by commercial blood test equipments. The method presented robust outcome to accurately identify COVID-19 from a variety of suspected patients with similar CT information or similar symptoms, with accuracy of 0.9795 and 0.9697 for the cross-validation set and test set, respectively. The tool also demonstrated its outstanding performance on an external validation set that was completely independent of the modeling process, with sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 0.9512, 0.9697, and 0.9595, respectively. Besides, 24 samples from overseas infected patients with COVID-19 were used to make an in-depth clinical assessment with accuracy of 0.9167. After multiple verification, the reliability and repeatability of the tool has been fully evaluated, and it has the potential to develop into an emerging technology to identify COVID-19 and lower the burden of global public health.

We estimated the number and percent of excess deaths due to COVID-19 In April 2020 in the United States, New York City, and Michigan. Methods: For each locale we calculated attributable fractions in the exposed comparing observed COVID-19 deaths and expected deaths. In addition, we estimated the number of months it would take for the excess deaths to occur without the virus and the proportions of the populations that were infected leading to the April deaths. We compared the excess deaths from the attributable fraction method to those obtained by comparing weekly deaths in 2019 and 2020. Results: Using an assumed infection fatality rate of 1%, the percentages of excess deaths were 95%, 97%, and 95% in the US, NYC, and MI equivalent to 54,560; 14,951; and 3,338 deaths, respectively. Absent the virus these deaths would have occurred over 21.0, 29.2, and 18.4 months in the respective locations. An estimated 1.7% of the US population was infected between March 13 and April 10, 2020. Nearly 19% were infected in NYC. Conclusions: Over 75% of COVID-19 deaths in April 2020 were excess deaths meaning they would not have occurred in April without SARS-CoV-2 but would have been spread out over the ensuing 18 to 29 months. Confirmed cases in the US under-report the actual number of infections by at least an order of magnitude. Excess death numbers calculated using the attributable fraction in the exposed are similar to those obtained from weekly mortality reports.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harry P Wetzler","author_inst":"Ofstead and Associates"},{"author_name":"Erica A Wetzler","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liting Zhang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Wenbo Meng","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Junfeng Li","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chongxiang Tong","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Hospital of Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Li","author_inst":"Gansu Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Cai","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Hospital of Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Zengwei Yang","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Hospital of Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Jinhong Zhu","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Meie Zhao","author_inst":"the First People Hospital of Lanzhou City"},{"author_name":"Huirong Huang","author_inst":"the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Xie","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Shuyan Li","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mrgherita Baldassarri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Brusco","author_inst":"University of Turin"},{"author_name":"Rosanna Asselta","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Bruttini Mirella","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Marco Seri","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Nigro","author_inst":"University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Napoli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Matullo","author_inst":"University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Tartaglia","author_inst":"Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Mari","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Renieri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Annamaria Pinto","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.019877","rel_title":"Leveraging mRNAs sequences to express SARS-CoV-2 antigens in vivo","rel_date":"2020-04-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.019877","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become a pandemic worldwide; therefore, an effective vaccine is urgently needed. Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising platform for vaccination. Here, we systematically investigated the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, we identified the optimal combination of 5 and 3 UTR, termed as NASAR, which was five to ten-fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid-derived nanoparticles showed dramatic expression of potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens both in vitro and in vivo. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as alternative SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chunxi Zeng","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Xucheng Hou","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Jingyue Yan","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Chengxiang Zhang","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Li","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Weiyu Zhao","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Shi Du","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Yizhou Dong","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Zengwei Yang","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Hospital of Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Jinhong Zhu","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Meie Zhao","author_inst":"the First People Hospital of Lanzhou City"},{"author_name":"Huirong Huang","author_inst":"the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Xie","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Shuyan Li","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mrgherita Baldassarri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Brusco","author_inst":"University of Turin"},{"author_name":"Rosanna Asselta","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Bruttini Mirella","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Marco Seri","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Nigro","author_inst":"University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Napoli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Matullo","author_inst":"University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Tartaglia","author_inst":"Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Mari","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Renieri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Annamaria Pinto","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"}]}
