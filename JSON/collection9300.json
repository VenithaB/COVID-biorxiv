ACE2 is also suggested to be the receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing a serious epidemic in China manifested with severe respiratory syndrome. B0AT1 (SLC6A19) is a neutral amino acid transporter whose surface expression in intestinal cells requires ACE2. Here we present the 2.9 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1. The complex, assembled as a dimer of ACE2-B0AT1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains (PDs) of ACE2. A newly resolved Collectrin-like domain (CLD) on ACE2 mediates homo-dimerization. Structural modelling suggests that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiang Zhou","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Renhong Yan","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Zhang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yaning Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Lu Xia","author_inst":"Westlake University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.08.939892","rel_title":"Single-cell Analysis of ACE2 Expression in Human Kidneys and Bladders Reveals a Potential Route of 2019-nCoV Infection","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.08.939892","rel_abs":"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus named 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan of China and spread to several countries worldwide within just one month. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV. In a short period of time, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), have been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). To investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in 2019-nCoV patients, we used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and an independent unpublished kidney single cell RNA-Seq data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expressions in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders.\n\nOur results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells. These results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection, along with the respiratory system and digestion system. Our findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may be due to proximal tubule cells damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury. Beyond that, laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."},{"author_name":"Longfei Hu","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhang","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Jushua D.

Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the SARS-CoV-2 involving the RBD. As a result of this recombination event, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a similar genotype in RBD, including two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), and alleles 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts with the human ACE2 receptor. Ancestral state analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 differentiated from its most recent common ancestor with RaTG13 by accumulating a significant number of amino acid changes in the RBD. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus whereby the SARS-CoV-2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, the lineage that led to SARS-CoV-2 accumulated further, unique changes specifically in the RBD.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Angel Patino-Galindo","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Ioan Filip","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Mohammed AlQuraishi","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Raul Rabadan","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Xue-Bing Ni","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yun-Shi Liao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"William Yiu-Man Cheung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wen-Juan Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian-Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gabriel M Leung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yan-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Guan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Shantou University"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.10.942185","rel_title":"Structural modeling of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) spike protein reveals a proteolytically-sensitive activation loop as a distinguishing feature compared to SARS-CoV and related SARS-like coronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.10.942185","rel_abs":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on Hubei province, China and is a major public health concern.

Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier A.

Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources. Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm\/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin Bu","author_inst":"Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pekin Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Dong-Dong Peng","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Hui Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Qian Yue","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Yan Han","author_inst":"Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Withsum Technology Limited"},{"author_name":"Gang Hu","author_inst":"School of Agriculture, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Wen-Juan Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian-Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gabriel M Leung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yan-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Guan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Shantou University"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.12.20022400","rel_title":"Can Search Query Forecast successfully in China's 2019-nCov pneumonia?","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.12.20022400","rel_abs":"Recently the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) pneumonia outbreak in China then the world, and the Number of infections and death continues to increases.

Credible data source from Baidu Qianxi were used to assess the number of infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other areas. Results Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 in the very early stage. The true infected number was 4508 in our model in Wuhan before January 22, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan, stage 1), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 1) and 3.3 (China except Hubei, stage 1) to 0.67 (Wuhan, stage 4), 0.83 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 2) and 0.63 (China except Hubei, stage 2), respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073, 21342 and 13384 infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively, and there would be 2179, 633 and 107 death in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively. Conclusion A series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic will end in early April.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Zhang","author_inst":"School of Environment and Natural Resources, Renmin University of China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Fang Zhou","author_inst":"Beijing Key Laboratory of Megaregions Sustainable Development Modeling, Capital University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"Qian Yue","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Yan Han","author_inst":"Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Withsum Technology Limited"},{"author_name":"Gang Hu","author_inst":"School of Agriculture, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Wen-Juan Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian-Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gabriel M Leung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yan-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Guan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Shantou University"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.17.20024034","rel_title":"Epidemic Situation of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China mainland","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.17.20024034","rel_abs":"[Objective] Analyze the occurrence of novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) in China mainland, explore the epidemiological rules, and evaluate the effect of prevention and control.

The dynamical model reveals the impact of various measures on the key parameters of the epidemic. According to the public data of NHCs from 01\/20 to 02\/09, we predict the epidemic peak and possible end time for 5 different regions. The epidemic in Beijing and Shanghai, Mainland\/Hubei and Hubei\/Wuhan, are expected to end before the end of February, and before mid- March respectively. The model indicates that, the outbreak in Wuhan is predicted to be ended in the early April. As a result, more effective policies and more efforts on clinical research are demanded. Moreover, through the backtracking simulation, we infer that the outbreak of the epidemic in Mainland\/Hubei, Hubei\/Wuhan, and Wuhan can be dated back to the end of December 2019 or the beginning of January 2020.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liangrong Peng","author_inst":"Minjiang University"},{"author_name":"Wuyue Yang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Dongyan Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Changjing Zhuge","author_inst":"Beijing University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Liu Hong","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Withsum Technology Limited"},{"author_name":"Gang Hu","author_inst":"School of Agriculture, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Wen-Juan Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian-Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gabriel M Leung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yan-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Guan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Shantou University"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.15.20023499","rel_title":"Estimating the Case Fatality Risk of COVID-19 using Cases from Outside China","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.15.20023499","rel_abs":"There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China.

It very urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate epidemics. The estimated potential total number of confirmed cases and key dates for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may provide certain guidance for governments, organizations and citizens to optimize preparedness and response efforts.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinmiao Fu","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Qi Ying","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Tieyong Zeng","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tao Long","author_inst":"Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Withsum Technology Limited"},{"author_name":"Gang Hu","author_inst":"School of Agriculture, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Wen-Juan Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian-Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gabriel M Leung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yan-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Guan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Shantou University"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.16.20023671","rel_title":"Longitudinal characteristics of lymphocyte responses and cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.16.20023671","rel_abs":"Background: The dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines profiles of patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their correlation with the disease severity remain unclear. Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-{gamma} levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19.

By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)TI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"lianglu zhang Sr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"kangkang wan Jr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"jing chen Sr.","author_inst":"Clinics of Oilcrops Research Institute, CAAS"},{"author_name":"changming lu Sr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"lanlan dong Jr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"zhicheng wu Sr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiaoxia Tong","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yi","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Xiong","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunxia Guo","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin Tian","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinzhuo Luo","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Yao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ran Pang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Shen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ting Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Weng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunrong Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huabing Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruxia Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helong Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiliu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pian Ye","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengsong He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongwen He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Jie","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianao Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengqin Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.15.20023440","rel_title":"Evaluating new evidence in the early dynamics of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with real time domestic traffic and potential asymptomatic transmissions","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.15.20023440","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to 28 countries\/regions with over 43,000 confirmed cases. Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Can Zhou","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"kangkang wan Jr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co.,

Wuhan, Hubei province since December 2019, and caused a rapid outbreak throughout China and globally. Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS. We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene. Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 exists and should be acknowledged. Repeated sampling, change of specimen type or metagenomics sequencing could further facilitate during critical clinical cases.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing-Wen Ai","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hao-Cheng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Teng Xu","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jing Wu","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengqi Zhu","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yi-Qi Yu","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Han-Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongliang Shen","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xian Zhou","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Guo-Qing Zang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Jing Chen","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yong-Jun Li","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"De-Sheng Xie","author_inst":"Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ming-Zhe Zhou","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jing-Ying Sun","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jia-Zhen Chen","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Weng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunrong Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huabing Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruxia Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helong Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiliu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pian Ye","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengsong He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongwen He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Jie","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianao Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengqin Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.13.20022806","rel_title":"Impact of seasonal forcing on a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-02-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.13.20022806","rel_abs":"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020\/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Robert Dyrdak","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute and Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Valentin Druelle","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Yi-Qi Yu","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Han-Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongliang Shen","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xian Zhou","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Guo-Qing Zang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Jing Chen","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yong-Jun Li","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"De-Sheng Xie","author_inst":"Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ming-Zhe Zhou","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jing-Ying Sun","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jia-Zhen Chen","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Weng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunrong Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huabing Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruxia Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helong Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiliu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pian Ye","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengsong He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongwen He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Jie","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianao Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengqin Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.12.20022467","rel_title":"The role of absolute humidity on transmission rates of the COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-02-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.12.20022467","rel_abs":"A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has caused over 40,000 cases worldwide to date.

However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Luo","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maimuna S Majumder","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Dianbo Liu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Canelle Poirier","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenneth D Mandl","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

To control the spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the gold standard but is time-consuming with significant false negative results. Therefore, alternative diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we hypothesized that Artificial Intelligence's deep learning methods might be able to extract COVID-19's specific graphical features and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. Methods and Findings: We collected 1,065 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases (325 images) along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia (740 images). We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images that first two nucleic acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the proof-of-principle for using artificial intelligence to extract radiological features for timely and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Kang","author_inst":"Tianjin University, National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin"},{"author_name":"Jinlu Ma","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Xian Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xianjun Zeng","author_inst":"Nanchang University First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mingming Xiao","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jia Guo","author_inst":"National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin"},{"author_name":"Mengjiao Cai","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Xian Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jingyi Yang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Xian Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yaodong Li","author_inst":"No.8 Hospital, Xian Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiangfei Meng","author_inst":"National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin"},{"author_name":"Bo Xu","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Jing Chen","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yong-Jun Li","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"De-Sheng Xie","author_inst":"Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ming-Zhe Zhou","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jing-Ying Sun","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jia-Zhen Chen","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Weng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunrong Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huabing Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruxia Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helong Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiliu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pian Ye","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengsong He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongwen He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Jie","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianao Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengqin Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.13.20022830","rel_title":"A simple laboratory parameter facilitates early identification of COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-02-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.13.20022830","rel_abs":"The total number of COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this infection in Wuhan, China has reached 40000 and are still growing.

To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and\/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qilin Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiuli Ding","author_inst":"Wuan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Geqing Xia","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhi Geng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fenghua Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jingyi Yang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Xian Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yaodong Li","author_inst":"No.8 Hospital, Xian Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiangfei Meng","author_inst":"National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin"},{"author_name":"Bo Xu","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Jing Chen","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yong-Jun Li","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"De-Sheng Xie","author_inst":"Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ming-Zhe Zhou","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jing-Ying Sun","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jia-Zhen Chen","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Weng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunrong Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huabing Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruxia Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helong Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiliu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pian Ye","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengsong He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongwen He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Jie","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianao Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengqin Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.14.20022913","rel_title":"Estimating the Efficacy of Traffic Blockage and Quarantine for the Epidemic Caused by 2019-nCoV (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-02-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.14.20022913","rel_abs":"Background: Since the 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. Method: We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study, the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine. Results: In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control. Conclusion: Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19. However, the eff icacy of quarantine is found to be much stronger than that of traffic blockage. Considering traffic blockage may also cause huge losses of economy, we propose to gradually deregulate the traffic blockage, and improve quarantine instead. Also, there might be a large number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, the quarantine should be continued for a long time until the epidemic is totally under control.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Deqiang Li","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Zhicheng Liu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Qinghe Liu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Zefei Gao","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Junkai Zhu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Junyan Yang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Jingyi Yang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Xian Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yaodong Li","author_inst":"No.8 Hospital, Xian Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiangfei Meng","author_inst":"National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin"},{"author_name":"Bo Xu","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Jing Chen","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yong-Jun Li","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"De-Sheng Xie","author_inst":"Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ming-Zhe Zhou","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jing-Ying Sun","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jia-Zhen Chen","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Weng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunrong Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huabing Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruxia Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helong Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiliu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pian Ye","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengsong He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongwen He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Jie","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianao Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengqin Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.14.20021535","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics of 2019 Novel Infected Coronavirus Pneumonia\uff1aA Systemic Review and Meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-02-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.14.20021535","rel_abs":"Background:A Novel pneumonia associated with the 2019 coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) suddenly broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 37287 confirmed cases and 813 death case in China (Until 8th\/Feb\/2019) have been reported in just fortnight. Although this risky pneumonia with high infection rates and high mortality rates need to be resolved immediately, major gaps in our knowledge of clinical characters of it were still not be established. The aim of this study is to summaries and analysis the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Methods: Literature have been systematically performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, GreyNet International, and The Cochrane Library from inception up to February 8, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality, and publication bias was analyzed by Egger test.

From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86, 449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asami Anzai","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Tetsuro Kobayashi","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Natalie M.

Importation of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the United Kingdom highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"T.

Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection. Methods Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. Results We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably. Conclusions A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruiyun Li","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sen Pei","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Yimeng Song","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Wan Yang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sungmok Jung","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Miyama","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Andrei R.
