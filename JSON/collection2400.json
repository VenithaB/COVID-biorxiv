In Italy, first line management of pediatric care is handed over to Primary Care Pediatricians (PCPs), who were not allowed to directly perform diagnostic tests during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Without a confirmatory diagnosis, PCPs could only collect information on ''COVID-19 like symptoms'' rather than identify typical COVID-19 symptoms. AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 like symptoms in outpatient children, during Italian lockdown. To provide PCPs a risk score to be used in clinical practice during the differential diagnosis process. METHODS: A survey was submitted to 50 PCPs (assisting 47,500 children) from 7 different Italian regions between the 4th of March and the 23rd of May 2020 (total and partial lockdown period). COVID-19 like symptoms in the assisted children were recorded, as well as presence of confirmed\/suspected cases in children's families, which was taken as proxy of COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression was accomplished to estimate the risk of having suspected\/confirmed cases in families, considering symptoms as potential determinants. RESULTS: 2,300 children (4.8% of overall survey population) fell ill with COVID-19 like symptoms, 3.1% and 1.7% during total and partial lockdown period respectively. The concurrent presence of fatigue, cough, and diarrhea in children, in absence of sore throat\/earache and abnormal skin signs, represents the maximum risk level of having a suspected\/confirmed case of COVID-19 at home. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of children presenting COVID-19 like symptoms at home has been remarkable also during the total lockdown period. The present study identified a pattern of symptoms which could help, in a cost-effective perspective, PCPs in daily clinical practice to define priorities in addressing children to the proper diagnostic procedure.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianfranco Trapani","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Sanremo (IM), Italy"},{"author_name":"Vassilios Fanos","author_inst":"Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Enrico Bertino","author_inst":"Neonatal Care Unit, Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giulia Maiocco","author_inst":"Neonatal Care Unit, Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Osama Al Jamal","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Cagliari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Fiore","author_inst":"Primary Care Pediatrician, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"VIncenzo Bembo","author_inst":"Primary Care Pediatrician, Frosinone, Italy"},{"author_name":"Domenico Careddu","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Novara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lando Barberio","author_inst":"Primary Care Pediatrician, Taggia (IM), Italy"},{"author_name":"Luisella Zanino","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Verlato","author_inst":"Unit of Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Department of Diagnostics & Public Health, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20162057","rel_title":"Predicting PPE use, post-traumatic stress, and physical symptoms during the early weeks of COVID-19 lockdowns in the USA","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20162057","rel_abs":"Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic combined with inconsistent governmental and public health recommendations, media communications emphasizing threat, and widespread lockdowns created a complex psychological environment for Americans. In this study, 450 MTurk workers completed measures of (a) risk for COVID-19, (b) perceived vulnerability to disease, (c) intolerance of uncertainty, (d) mindfulness, (e) COVID-19 preventive health behaviors, (f) post-Trauma symptoms, and (g) stress related physical symptoms. The surveys were completed between April 9, 2020 and April 18, 2020 which is a period that corresponded to the first 2-3 weeks of lockdown for most participants. A substantial number of participants reported a reduction employment status and 69% were in self-isolation. The participants reported a high degree of perceived vulnerability with 68% indicating they felt there was a 50\/50 chance or greater they would contract COVID-19. Mask wearing was variable: 16% not at all, 20% some of the time, 42% a good part of the time, and 26% most of the time. Using clinical cutoff on the post-trauma scale, 70% of the sample would be considered to have symptoms consistent with PTSD. The mean level of physical symptoms was significantly (p < .001) and substantially higher (d = 1.46) than norms. PPE use was positively associated with level of education and mindfulness nonreactivity and negatively associated with age, having a current medical condition, and mindfulness nonjudgment. Post trauma and physical health symptoms were strongly predicted by susceptibility variables and intolerance of uncertainty.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William H OBrien","author_inst":"Bowling Green State University"},{"author_name":"Shan Wang","author_inst":"Duke Kunshan University"},{"author_name":"Aniko Viktoria Varga","author_inst":"Bowling Green State University"},{"author_name":"Huanzhen Xu","author_inst":"Bowling Green State University"},{"author_name":"Tracy E Sims","author_inst":"Bowling Green State University"},{"author_name":"Kristin A Horan","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Chung Xiann Lim","author_inst":"Bowling Green State University"},{"author_name":"Domenico Careddu","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Novara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lando Barberio","author_inst":"Primary Care Pediatrician, Taggia (IM), Italy"},{"author_name":"Luisella Zanino","author_inst":"Alfred Nobel's Friends International Association Study Center and Primary Care Pediatrician, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Verlato","author_inst":"Unit of Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Department of Diagnostics & Public Health, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20156836","rel_title":"Modeling the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 deposition in the respiratory tract mimicked by the 11C radionuclide","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20156836","rel_abs":"The knowledge on the deposition and retention of the viral particle of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract during the very initial intake from the ambient air is of prime importance to understand the infectious process and COVID-19 initial symptoms.

We estimated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among blood donors in Kenya. Methods We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG prevalence by ELISA on residual blood donor samples obtained between April 30 and June 16, 2020. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 83% (95% CI 59, 96%) and 99.0% (95% CI 98.1, 99.5%), respectively. National seroprevalence was estimated using Bayesian multilevel regression and post-stratification to account for non-random sampling with respect to age, sex and region, adjusted for assay performance. Results Complete data were available for 3098 of 3174 donors, aged 15-64 years. By comparison with the Kenyan population, the sample over-represented males (82% versus 49%), adults aged 25-34 years (40% versus 27%) and residents of coastal Counties (49% versus 9%). Crude overall seroprevalence was 5.6% (174\/3098). Population-weighted, test-adjusted national seroprevalence was 5.2% (95% CI 3.7, 7.1%). Seroprevalence was highest in the 3 largest urban Counties; Mombasa (9.3% [95% CI 6.4, 13.2%)], Nairobi (8.5% [95% CI 4.9, 13.5%]) and Kisumu (6.5% [95% CI 3.3, 11.2%]). Conclusions We estimate that 1 in 20 adults in Kenya had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the study period. By the median date of our survey, only 2093 COVID-19 cases and 71 deaths had been reported through the national screening system. This contrasts, by several orders of magnitude, with the numbers of cases and deaths reported in parts of Europe and America when seroprevalence was similar.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sophie Uyoga","author_inst":"KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Ifedayo M.O.

Our diagnostic laboratory faced a rapid increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, with up to 1,007 tests per day. To maintain a rapid turnaround time to support patient management and public health authorities' decisions, we moved from a case-by-case validation of RT-PCR to an automated validation and immediate transmission of the results to clinicians. To maintain high quality and to track possible aberrant results, we developed a quality-monitoring tool based on a homemade algorithm coded in R. We present the results of this quality-monitoring tool applied to 35,137 RT-PCR results corresponding to 30,198 patients. Patients tested several times led to 4,939 pairwise comparisons; 88% concordant and 12% discrepant. Among the 573 discrepancies, 428 were automatically solved by the algorithm. The most likely explanation for these 573 discrepancies was related for 44.9% of the situations to \"Clinical evolution\", 27.9% to \"Preanalytical\" problems, and 25.3% to \"Stochastic\". Finally, 11 discrepant results could not be explained, including 8 received from external partners for which clinical data were not available. The implemented quality-monitoring strategy allowed to: i) assist the investigation of discrepant results ii) focus the attention of medical microbiologists onto results requiring a specific expertise and iii) maintain an acceptable TAT. This work highlighted the high RT-PCR consistency for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and the importance of automated processes to handle a huge number of samples while preserving quality.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linda Mueller","author_inst":"University Hospital of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Valentin Scherz","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Gilbert Greub","author_inst":"University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Katia Jaton","author_inst":"University of Lausanne and University Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Onya Opota","author_inst":"University Hospital of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Perpetual Wanjiku","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Rashid Aman","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya"},{"author_name":"Mercy Mwangangi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya"},{"author_name":"Patrick Amoth","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya"},{"author_name":"Kadondi Kasera","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya"},{"author_name":"Wangari Ng'ang'a","author_inst":"Presidential Policy & Strategy Unit, The Presidency, Government of Kenya"},{"author_name":"Charles Rombo","author_inst":"Kenya National Blood Transfusion Services"},{"author_name":"Christine K.

Here we compare qRT-PCR with DETECTR to diagnose COVID-19 on 378 patient samples and report a 95% reproducibility. Patient sample dilution assays suggest a higher analytical sensitivity of DETECTR compared to qRT-PCR, however, this was not confirmed in a large patient cohort. The data showed that both techniques are equally sensitive in detecting SARS-CoV-2 providing an added value of DETECTR to the currently used qRT-PCR platforms. For DETECTR, different gRNAs can be used simultaneously to obviate negative results due to mutations in N-gene. Lateral flow strips, suitable as a point of care test (POCT), showed a 100% correlation to the high-throughput DETECTR assay. Importantly, DETECTR was 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 and did not detect other human coronaviruses. As there is no need for specialized equipment, DETECTR could be rapidly implemented as a complementary technically independent approach to qRT-PCR thereby increasing the testing capacity of medical microbiological laboratories and relieving the existent PCR-platforms for routine non- SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eelke Brandsma","author_inst":"Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, Amsterdam University Medical Center,  University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematopoiesis, Amsterdam, The Netherla"},{"author_name":"Han JMP Verhagen","author_inst":"Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, Amsterdam University Medical Center,  University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematopoiesis, Amsterdam, The Netherla"},{"author_name":"Thijs J.W. van de Laar","author_inst":"Medical Microbiology, Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Eric C.J.

Our findings reinforce that isolation index can be an effective surrogate for modeling and epidemiological analyses and, more importantly, can be an useful metrics for anticipating the need for early interventions, a critical issue in public health.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Jardim Sr.","author_inst":"INCT EECBio; Universidade Federal de Goias"},{"author_name":"Jose Alexandre Diniz-Filho Sr.","author_inst":"UFG"},{"author_name":"Thiago Fernando Rangel Sr.","author_inst":"Depto Ecologia ICB UFG"},{"author_name":"Cristiana Maria Toscano II","author_inst":"IPTSP, UFG"},{"author_name":"Janami Steenkamp","author_inst":"PathCare Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Douglas B Kell","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Asier Antonana-Vildosola","author_inst":"CIC bioGUNE"},{"author_name":"Chiara Bruzzone","author_inst":"CIC bioGUNE"},{"author_name":"Maider Bizkarguenaga","author_inst":"CIC bioGUNE"},{"author_name":"Nieves Embade","author_inst":"CIC bioGUNE"},{"author_name":"Nicola G A Abrescia","author_inst":"CIC bioGUNE"},{"author_name":"Jose M.

Objective: To examine if age, sex, race\/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions is independently associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: 70 counties within 12 states participating in the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) and a population-based sample of non-hospitalized adults residing in the COVID-NET catchment area from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Participants: U.S. community-dwelling adults ([&ge;]18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, March 1- June 23, 2020. Measurements: Adjusted rate ratios (aRR) of hospitalization by age, sex, race\/ethnicity and underlying medical conditions (hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of stroke, diabetes, obesity [BMI [&ge;]30 kg\/m2], severe obesity [BMI[&ge;]40 kg\/m2], chronic kidney disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Results: Our sample included 5,416 adults with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. Adults with (versus without) severe obesity (aRR:4.4; 95%CI: 3.4, 5.7), chronic kidney disease (aRR:4.0; 95%CI: 3.0, 5.2), diabetes (aRR:3.2; 95%CI: 2.5, 4.1), obesity (aRR:2.9; 95%CI: 2.3, 3.5), hypertension (aRR:2.8; 95%CI: 2.3, 3.4), and asthma (aRR:1.4; 95%CI: 1.1, 1.7) had higher rates of hospitalization, after adjusting for age, sex, and race\/ethnicity. In models adjusting for the presence of an individual underlying medical condition, higher hospitalization rates were observed for adults [&ge;]65 years, 45-64 years (versus 18-44 years), males (versus females), and non-Hispanic black and other race\/ethnicities (versus non-Hispanic whites). Limitations: Interim analysis limited to hospitalizations with underlying medical condition data. Conclusion: Our findings elucidate groups with higher hospitalization risk that may benefit from targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean Y.

A case study is conducted using a large urban region, Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. Results are intended to serve as a planning guide for public health decision-makers. Methods: The simulation model mimics the daily social mixing behavior of the susceptible and infected generating the spread. Data representing demographics of the region, virus epidemiology, and social interventions shapes model behavior. Results include daily values of infected, reported, hospitalized, and dead. Results: Study results show that stay-at-home order is quite effective in flattening and then reversing the case growth curve subsiding the pandemic with only 5.8% of the population infected. Whereas, following the current Phase II reopening plan could end the pandemic via herd immunity with 75% people infected. Use of surgical variety face masks reduced infected by 20%. A further reduction of 66% was achieved through contact tracing. Conclusions: For Miami-Dade County, a strategy comprising mandatory use of face masks and aggressive contact tracing to identify 50% of the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic, if adopted now, can potentially steer the COVID-19 pandemic to subside within next 3 months with approximately one-fifth of the population infected.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanisha Tatapudi","author_inst":"Industrial and Management Systems Engineering, University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Rachita Das","author_inst":"Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida"},{"author_name":"Tapas K.

Understanding the risk factors for poor outcomes of COVID-19 is thus important for successful management and control of the pandemic. However, the progress and severity of the epidemic across different regions show great differentiations. We hypothesized the origination of these differences are based on location-dependent variations in underlying population-wide health factors. Disease prevalence or incidence data of states and counties of the United States were collected for a group of chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, physical inactivation, and common cancers (e.g., lung, colorectal, stomach, kidney and renal). Correlation and regression analysis identified the prevalence of heart failure as a significant positive factor for region-level COVID-19 mortality. Similarly, the incidence of gastric cancer and thyroid cancer were also identified as significant factors contributing to regional variation in COVID-19 mortality. To explore the implications of these results, we re-analyzed the RNA-seq data for stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) and colon carcinoma (COAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We found that expression of genes in the immune response pathways were more severely disturbed in STAD than in COAD, implicating higher probability for STAD patients or individuals with precancerous chronic stomach diseases to develop cytokine storm once infected with COVID-19. Taken together, we conclude that location variations in particular chronic diseases and cancers contribute significantly to the regional variations in COVID-19 mortality.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongxing Yang","author_inst":"Merck Holding (China), a business of Merck KGaA"},{"author_name":"Fei Zhong","author_inst":"MilliporeSigma, a business of KGaA"},{"author_name":"Tapas K.

No study has been conducted assessing the psychological impact of this pandemic on the general public in Nepal. The objective of this study is to assess the mental health status during COVID 19 outbreak and explore the potential influencing factors among the population attending the hospital fever clinics with COVID 19 symptoms. Methods: A cross sectional survey was conducted between May to June, 2020 with a sample of 645 participants aged 18 and above in 26 hospitals across Nepal. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire along with a validated psychometric tool, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS21) scale. The metrics and scores of symptoms and their severity were created and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of potential covariates with outcome variables. Results: The prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress were 14%, 7% and 5% respectively. Participants from Bagmati province reported higher level of anxiety (OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.42 10.59), while stress (OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.09 21.29) and depressive symptoms (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.10 10.35) observed higher among the participants in Province 1.

Similarly, people with primary level education found more prone to all factors, stress (OR 20.35, 95% CI 2.06 201.19), anxiety (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.24 7.91), and depression (OR 4.41, 95% CI 1.29 15.07). More farmers than labors showed higher odds (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.01 5.01) for anxiety, while individuals surveyed who reported their health status as poor-had higher odds (OR 5.95, 95% CI 1.08 32.68) for depression. Also, people currently living in rented houses reported more stress (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.07 9.05) and those living far from family reported higher rates of depressive symptoms (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.01 12.58). Conclusion: The study identified increased prevalence of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the initial stage of COVID 19 pandemic in Nepal. Considering the findings, there is urgent need to develop and implement appropriate community-based mental health programs targeting individuals who have had COVID 19 symptoms and who are prone to develop adverse mental health outcomes.

Longitudinal assessment of mental health during Covid-19 in a representative population-based sample, however, is currently largely missing. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in perceived stress levels and depressive symptoms measured before and during Covid-19 pandemic in a representative population-based sample. Methods: Baseline data on stress levels and depressive symptoms from a well-established population-based sample were compared with those obtained from self-administered e-questionnaires distributed during Covid-19 pandemic. A total of 715 participants completed e-questionnaires. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test repeated-measure differences, while between-group differences were analysed using Mann-Whitney and the Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Perceived stress levels and depressive symptoms increased 1.4 and 5.5 times, respectively, during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the time prior Covid-19. Changes in stress and depressive symptoms were most significant in females and did not depend on whether one quarantined alone or with others. Feeling of loneliness during Covid-19 pandemic had the greatest impact on increased stress levels and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: This population-based longitudinal study showed that Covid-19 related measures had significant impact on mental health in a general population with the feeling of loneliness identified as the biggest risk factor. This impact indicates the need of timely and tailored treatment of mental health disorders and integration of preventive mental health measures into global public health policies to protect mental health during future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan Sebastian Novotny","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Pablo Gonzalez Rivas","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarka Kunzova","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Skladana","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anna Pospisilova","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anna Polcrova","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jose R Medina Inojosa","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Francisco Lopez-Jimenez","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yonas E Geda","author_inst":"Barrow Neurological Institute"},{"author_name":"Gorazd B Stokin","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sue Kim","author_inst":"Michigan Department of Health and Human Services"},{"author_name":"Ruth Lynfield","author_inst":"Minnesota Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Salina M.

Setting Level: This study utilizes data for 125 countries for contextual variables from 1st January 2020 until the 15th June 2020. Participants: This study considers deaths from covid-19. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The contextual variables considered in this study are stringency index, stringency variability, lockdown date, population density, level of airline passengers and country health security index. Results: It is shown there is a very strong association between the level of airline passengers and covid-19 deaths. The results from regression analysis conducted in this study show significant positive relationships at the 5% level of statistical significance between Deaths from covid-19 and airline passenger levels and stringency variability; significant negative relationships are revealed for stringency index and lockdown date supporting the notion that lock down and social distancing measures mattered and were effective. The Global health security index and population density did not significantly affect deaths. Conclusion: This study highlights the strong link between a country's airline passengers and covid-19 deaths and found that the lockdown date and stringency measures had a significant effect upon deaths. The implications of the research is that lockdown and stringency measures implemented by governments around the world worked and mattered. Further, the fact that global health security did not affect deaths may indicate better preparedness required to confront future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"VINCENT J.

The emerging infections that lead to substantive epidemics or pandemics are typically zoonoses that cross species boundaries at vulnerable points of animal-human interface. The sharing of space between wildlife and humans, and their domesticated animals, has dramatically increased in recent decades and is a key driver of pathogen spillover. Increasing animal-human interface has also occurred in concert with both increasing globalisation and failing health systems, resulting in a trifecta with dire implications for human and animal health. Nevertheless, to date we lack a geographical description of this trifecta that can be applied strategically to pandemic prevention. This investigation provides the first geographical quantification of the intersection of animal-human interfaces, poor human health system performance and global connectivity via the network of air travel. In so doing, this work provides a systematic, data-driven approach to classifying spillover hazard based on the distribution of animal-human interfaces while simultaneously identifying globally connected cities that are adjacent to these interfaces and which may facilitate global pathogen dissemination. We present this geography of high-impact spillover as a tool for developing targeted surveillance systems and improved health infrastructure in vulnerable areas that may present conduits for future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael G Walsh","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Shailendra Sawleshwarkar","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Shah Hossain","author_inst":"Manipal Academy of Higher Education"},{"author_name":"Siobhan Mor","author_inst":"Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Anna Pospisilova","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anna Polcrova","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jose R Medina Inojosa","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Francisco Lopez-Jimenez","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yonas E Geda","author_inst":"Barrow Neurological Institute"},{"author_name":"Gorazd B Stokin","author_inst":"St. Anne's University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sue Kim","author_inst":"Michigan Department of Health and Human Services"},{"author_name":"Ruth Lynfield","author_inst":"Minnesota Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Salina M.

We assessed the utility of this test to identify subjects with severe disease in two independent, longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients. Cell-free DNA profiling was performed on 104 plasma samples from 33 COVID-19 patients and compared to samples from patients with other viral infections and healthy controls. We found evidence of injury to the lung and liver and involvement of red blood cell progenitors associated with severe COVID-19. The concentration of cfDNA correlated with the WHO ordinal scale for disease progression and was significantly increased in patients requiring intubation.

Participants: A national sample of 1500 Australian adults with representative quotas for age and gender provided by online panel provider. Main outcome measure: Proportion of participants with correct\/incorrect knowledge of COVID-19 preventive behaviours and reasons for misconceptions. Results: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 were excluded, 13 declined, and 1500 participated in the survey (response rate 83%). Most participants correctly identified washing your hands regularly with soap and water (92%) and staying at least 1.5m away from others (90%) could help prevent COVID-19. Over 40% (incorrectly) considered wearing gloves outside of the home would prevent them contracting COVID-19. Views about face masks were divided. Only 66% of participants correctly identified that regular use of antibiotics would not prevent COVID-19. Most participants (90%) identified fever, fatigue and cough as indicators of COVID-19. However, 42% of participants thought that being unable to hold your breath for 10 seconds without coughing was an indicator of having the virus. The most frequently reported sources of COVID-19 information were commercial television channels (56%), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (43%), and the Australian Government COVID-19 information app (31%). Conclusions: Public messaging about hand hygiene and physical distancing to prevent transmission appear to have been effective. However, there are clear, identified barriers for many individuals that have the potential to impede uptake or maintenance of these behaviours in the long-term. Currently these non-drug interventions are our only effective strategy to combat this pandemic. Ensuring ongoing adherence to is critical.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rae Thomas","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Hannah Greenwood","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Zoe A Michaleff","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Eman Abukmail","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffmann","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Kirsten J McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Leah Hardiman","author_inst":"Consumer representative"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Jerome Ritz","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marty","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Donald Cuong Vinh","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Iwijn De Vlaminck","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Grant R.

Here, we have recruited a 144 COVID-19 patient cohort consisting of training, validation, and internal test sets, longitudinally recorded 124 routine clinical and laboratory parameters, and built a machine learning model to predict the disease progression based on measurements from the first 12 days since the disease onset when no patient became severe. A panel of 11 routine clinical factors, including oxygenation index, basophil counts, aspartate aminotransferase, gender, magnesium, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin time, oxygen saturation, body temperature and days after symptom onset, constructed a classifier for COVID-19 severity prediction, achieving accuracy of over 94%. Validation of the model in an independent cohort containing 25 patients achieved accuracy of 80%. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 0.70, 0.99, 0.93 and 0.93, respectively.

Thus, lymphopenia, T-cell exhaustion, and the increased levels of inflammatory mediators have been described in COVID-19 patients, in particular in severe cases1. Age represents a key factor in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality2. Understanding age-associated immune signatures of patients is therefore important to identify preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated the immune profile of COVID-19 hospitalized patients identifying a distinctive age-dependent immune signature associated with disease severity. Indeed, defined circulating factors - CXCL8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-27 and TNF- - positively correlate with older age, longer hospitalization, and a more severe form of the disease and may thus represent the leading signature in critical COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberta Angioni","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Sanchez-Rodriguez","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabio Munari","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicole Bertoldi","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Diletta Arcidiacono","author_inst":"Istituto Oncologico Veneto- IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cavinato","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, Padova University Hospital, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Marturano","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation Unit, University of Padova, Padova, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Annamaria Cattelan","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, Padova University Hospital, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonella Viola","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Barbara Molon","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, School of Life Sciences, Westlake University, Hangzhou, China;

CardioVascular Outcomes Trials (CVOTs) conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic are available. We aimed to estimate the effect of DPP4 inhibitors on the risk of respiratory infections. Methods We updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis, searching for CVOTs assessing a DPP4 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We focused on placebo-controlled CVOTs. Our primary outcome was 'any respiratory infection'. We added a sensitivity analysis integrating non-CVOTs and active-controlled CVOTs. Findings We included 47 714 patients in five placebo-controlled CVOTs. Median follow-up ranged from 1.5 years to 3 years. 4 369 events of overall respiratory infection were reported (rate of 9.2%). DPP4 inhibitors were not associated with a different risk compared to placebo (RR = 0.99 [95%CI: 0.93; 1.04]). The sensitivity analysis integrating the non-CVOTs studies and the active-controlled CVOT reached 11 349 events among 82 644 participants (rate of 13.7%). DPP4 inhibitors were not associated with a different risk of overall respiratory infection (RR = 1.00 [95% CI: 0.97; 1.03]). Interpretation Our up-dated meta-analysis provides the most powerful and least biased estimation of the association of DPP4 inhibitors and the risk of overall (non COVID-19) respiratory infection. We did not find any effect of the DPP4 inhibitors on the risk of respiratory infection. Our results support the recently published practical recommendations for the management of diabetes in patients with COVID-19, suggesting that DPP4 inhibitors should not be discontinued regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guillaume Grenet","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Samia Mekhaldi","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Sabine MAINBOURG","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service de Medecine Interne et Vasculaire, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Marine AUFFRET","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pole Sante Publique, Service hospitalo-universitaire de pharmacotoxicologie, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Catherine Cornu","author_inst":"CIC1407 INSERM, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Luc Cracowski","author_inst":"Univ.

Here, we assess immunogenicity and anamnestic protective efficacy in rhesus macaques of the intradermal (ID)-delivered SARS-CoV-2 spike DNA vaccine, INO-4800. INO-4800 is an ID-delivered DNA vaccine currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Vaccination with INO-4800 induced T cell responses and neutralizing antibody responses against both the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Several months after vaccination, animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in rapid recall of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein T and B cell responses. These responses were associated with lower viral loads in the lung and with faster nasal clearance of virus. These studies support the immune impact of INO-4800 for inducing both humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system which are likely important for providing durable protection against COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ami Patel","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Jewell Walters","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Emma L Reuschel","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Katherine Schultheis","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Parzych","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Ebony N Gary","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Igor Maricic","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Mansi Purwar","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Zeena Eblimit","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Susanne N Walker","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Diana Guimet","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Pratik Bhojnagarwala","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Arthur Doan","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Ziyang Xu","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Dustin Elwood","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Sophia M Reeder","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Pessaint","author_inst":"Bioqual, Rockville, MD 20852"},{"author_name":"Kevin Y Kim","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Anthony Cook","author_inst":"Bioqual, Rockville, MD 20852"},{"author_name":"Neethu Chokkalingam","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Brad Finneyfrock","author_inst":"Bioqual, Rockville, MD 20852"},{"author_name":"Edgar Tello-Ruiz","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Alan Dodson","author_inst":"Bioqual, Rockville, MD 20852"},{"author_name":"Jihae Choi","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Alison Generotti","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"John Harrison","author_inst":"Bioqual, Rockville, MD 20852"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Tursi","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Viviane M Andrade","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Yaya Dia","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Faraz I Zaidi","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Hanne Anderson","author_inst":"Bioqual, Rockville, MD 20852"},{"author_name":"Mark G Lewis","author_inst":"Bioqual, Rockville, MD 20852"},{"author_name":"Kar Muthumani","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"J Joseph Kim","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel W Kulp","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Laurent M Humeau","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Ramos","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Trevor RF Smith","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"David B Weiner","author_inst":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA"},{"author_name":"Kate E Broderick","author_inst":"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, USA"},{"author_name":"Carlos D.

MPro is an attractive target for antiviral therapies to combat the coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19). Here, we have used native mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the functional unit of Mpro. Analysis of the monomer-dimer equilibria reveals a dissociation constant of Kd = 0.14 {+\/-} 0.03 M, revealing MPro has a strong preference to dimerize in solution. Developing an MS-based kinetic assay we then characterized substrate turnover rates by following temporal changes in the enzyme-substrate complexes, which are effectively \"flash-frozen\" as they transition from solution to the gas phase. We screened small molecules, that bind distant from the active site, for their ability to modulate activity. These compounds, including one proposed to disrupt the catalytically active dimer, slow the rate of substrate processing by ~35%. This information was readily obtained and, together with analysis of the x-ray crystal structures of these enzyme-small molecule complexes, provides a starting point for the development of more potent molecules that allosterically regulate MPro activity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tarick J El-Baba","author_inst":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory University of Oxford South Parks Rd.

A variety of mechanisms may underlie the observed gender-related disparities including differences in sex hormones. However, the precise mechanisms by which female sex hormones may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity remains unknown. Here we report new insights into the molecular basis of the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the human ACE2 receptor. We further observed that glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Importantly estrogens can disrupt glycan-glycan interactions and glycan-protein interactions between the human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV2 thereby blocking its entry into cells. In a mouse model, estrogens reduced ACE2 glycosylation and thereby alveolar uptake of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results shed light on a putative mechanism whereby female sex hormones may provide protection from developing severe infection and could inform the development of future therapies against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Aguilar Pineda","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Mazen Albaghdadi","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wanlin Jiang","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Karin Janneth Vera Lopez","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Mark E Lindsay","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Davila del-Carpio","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Badhin Gomez Valdez","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Rajeev Malhotra","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian Lacks Lino Cardenas","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School-Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Vakonakis","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry University of Oxford South Parks Rd.

We directly exposed mucociliary air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures derived from primary human nonsmoker airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) to short term cigarette smoke and infected them with live SARS-CoV-2. We found an increase in the number of infected airway cells after cigarette smoke exposure as well as an increased number of apoptotic cells. Cigarette smoke exposure alone caused airway injury that resulted in an increased number of ABSCs, which proliferate to repair the airway. But we found that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or the combination of exposure to cigarette smoke and SARS-CoV-2 did not induce ABSC proliferation. We set out to examine the underlying mechanism governing the increased susceptibility of cigarette smoke exposed ALI to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell profiling of the cultures showed that infected airway cells displayed a global reduction in gene expression across all airway cell types. Interestingly, interferon response genes were induced in SARS-CoV-2 infected airway epithelial cells in the ALI cultures but smoking exposure together with SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced the interferon response. Treatment of cigarette smoke-exposed ALI cultures with Interferon {beta}-1 abrogated the viral infection, suggesting that the lack of interferon response in the cigarette smoke-exposed ALI cultures allows for more severe viral infection and cell death. In summary, our data show that acute smoke exposure allows for more severe proximal airway epithelial disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the mucosal innate immune response and ABSC proliferation and has implications for disease spread and severity in people exposed to cigarette smoke.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arunima Purkayastha","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chandani Sen","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Garcia Jr.","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Justin Langerman","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Preethi Vijayaraj","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"David W.
