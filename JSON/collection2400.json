We conducted a prospective study to assess deep lung inflammatory status in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 33 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swab admitted to the Intensive care unit (ICU) (n=28) and to the Intermediate Medicine Ward (IMW) (n=5). We analyze the differential cell count, ultrastructure of cells and Interleukin(IL)6, 8 and 10 levels. ICU patients showed a marked increase in neutrophils (72%, 60-81), lower lymphocyte (8%, 4-12) and macrophages fractions (17%, 11-27) compared to IMW patients (3%, 2-17, 15%, 6-26 and 74%, 58-90, respectively) (p<0.01). Ultrastructural study from ICU patients showed viral-like particles in cytopathic mononuclear cells however extensive cytopathic damage in all cell lineages. Immunostaining with anti-viral capsid and spike antibodies specifically immunoreacted with BAL cells, mostly cytopathic ones. IL6 and IL8 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in IMW (IL6 p<0.01, IL8 p<0.0001), and also in patients who did not survive (IL6 p < 0.05, IL8 p = 0.05 vs. survivors). IL10 did not show a significant variation between groups. Dividing patients by treatment received, lower BAL concentrations of IL6 were found in patients treated with steroids as compared to those treated with tocilizumab (p<0.1) or antivirals (p<0.05). Alveolitis, associated with COVID-19, is mainly sustained by innate effectors which showed features of extensive activation.

In India reporting of the first case was on January 30, 2020, and to prevent rapid community spread of the disease nationwide lockdown phase was imposed from March 25- June 1, 2020. Our objective was to assess various epidemiological measures during the lockdown phase. Methods: We used daily reporting of confirmed cases by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India during the period March 19-June 1, 2020. Using statistical packages STATA version 16.0 and R-packages in R-version 4.0, we fitted statistical distributions, estimated generation time and Basic Reproduction numbers. Results: During the lockdown phase, the daily per cent increase in the cumulative number of cases showed negative exponential growth with 0.022 as an instantaneous rate of decrease. Day specific incidence rate per million revealed the exponential pattern with 0.069 as the instantaneous rate of increase per day, which accounted for the doubling time of the disease (10 days; 95% CI: 9.25-10.93). Case fatality rate (2.92%; 95% CI: 2.82% -3.02%) and overall death rate was 1.14 (95% CI: 0.87-1.41) per million. were abysmally low. Statistical distribution fitting of new cases found to be satisfactory with Gamma distribution. Basic reproduction numbers 1.83 (95% CI: 1.82-1.83) was less. Conclusion: In India, with a population density of about 450 per Km2, the virulent of COVID-19 transmission was interrupted significantly with 70 days lockdown during the early transmission stage. A great decline could be seen in all the epidemiological indices compared to the index noted during the same period in the severely affected countries.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"PERUMAL VANAMAIL","author_inst":"ALL IND, INDIAIA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, NEW DELHI"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Fossali","author_inst":"Division of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, University of Milan, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Frangipane","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Sara Bozzini","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Monica Morosini","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Maura D'Amato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Sara Lettieri","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Mario Urtis","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Di Toro","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Saracino","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico S.

Currently available serological assays utilize single analyte technologies such as ELISA to measure antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) protein. To measure individual antibody (IgG and IgA) responses against SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs) NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1, we developed a multiplexed immunoassay (CoVi-plex), for which we included S and N proteins of these coronaviruses in an expanded antigen panel. Compared to commercial in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests our CoVi-plex achieved the highest sensitivity and specificity when analyzing 310 SARS-CoV-2 infected and 866 uninfected individuals. Simultaneously we see high IgG responses against hCoVs throughout all samples, whereas no consistent cross reactive IgG response patterns can be defined. In summary, our CoVi-plex is highly suited to monitor vaccination studies and will facilitate epidemiologic screenings for the humoral immunity toward pandemic as well as endemic coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthias Becker","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Monika Strengert","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany; TWINCORE GmbH, Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Resear"},{"author_name":"Daniel Junker","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Kerrinnes","author_inst":"Helmholtz-Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Wuerzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp D.

We developed a triage strategy including non-invasive respiratory support and admission to the intermediate care unit (IMCU). ICU admission was restricted to patients requiring invasive ventilation. Objectives The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the intermediate care unit. Method Retrospective cohort including consecutive patients admitted between March 28th and April 27th 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure avoiding ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included the rate of emergency intubation, 28-days mortality and predictors of ICU admission. Results One hundred fifty seven patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia were admitted to the IMCU. Among the 85 patients admitted for worsening respiratory failure, 52\/85 (61%) avoided ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, PaO2\/FiO2 (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99) and Body Mass Index (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98) were significantly associated with ICU admission. No death or emergency intubation occurred in the intermediate care unit. Among the 72 patients transferred from the ICU, 60\/72 (83%) presented neurological complications. Conclusions Non-invasive respiratory support including High-Flow Nasal Oxygen and continuous positive airway pressure prevents ICU admission for a large proportion of patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the context of the COVID pandemic, intermediate care units may play an important role in preserving ICU capacity by avoiding ICU admission for patients with worsening respiratory failure and allowing early discharge of ICU patients.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Olivier Grosgurin","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Antonio Leidi","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Pauline Darbellay-Farhoumand","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Carballo","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jean-luc Reny","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dan Adler","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Bollen Pinto","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Anne Rossel","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jacques Serratrice","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Thomas Agoritsas","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jerome Stirnemann","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Christophe Marti","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Simon Fink","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Felix Ruoff","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tamam Bakchoul","author_inst":"Institute for Clinical and Experimental Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Armin Baillot","author_inst":"Niedersaechsisches Landesgesundheitsamt, Department of Virology\/Serology, Hannover, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefan Lohse","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Saarland University Medical Center, Homburg\/Saar, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus Cornberg","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; Centre for Individualized Infection Medicine (CiiM), Hann"},{"author_name":"Thomas Illig","author_inst":"Hannover Unified Biobank (HUB), Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jens Gottlieb","author_inst":"Clinic for Pneumonology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sigrun Smola","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Saarland University Medical Center, Homburg\/Saar, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Karch","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Social Medicine, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Klaus Berger","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Social Medicine, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Rammensee","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Ce"},{"author_name":"Katja Schenke-Layland","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Germany; Department of Womens Health, Research Institute for Womens Health, Eberhard-"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC2180) Image-Guided and Functio"},{"author_name":"Melanie Maerklin","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Jonas S.

By developing highly sensitive and specific trimeric spike (S)-based antibody tests, we report IgM, IgG and IgA responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients (n=105) representing different categories of disease severity. All patients surveyed were IgG positive against S. Elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were associated with hospitalization, with IgA titers, increased circulating IL-6 and strong neutralizing responses indicative of intensive care status. Antibody-positive blood donors and pregnant women sampled during the pandemic in Stockholm, Sweden (weeks 14-25), displayed on average lower titers and weaker neutralizing responses compared to patients; however, inter-individual anti-viral IgG titers differed up to 1,000-fold. To provide more accurate estimates of seroprevalence, given the frequency of weak responders and the limitations associated with the dichotomization of a continuous variable (3,4), we used a Bayesian approach to assign likelihood of past infection without setting an assay cut-off. Analysis of blood donors (n=1,000) and pregnant women (n=900) sampled weekly demonstrated SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in 7.2% (95% Bayesian CI [5.1-9.5]) of individuals two months after the peak of spring 2020 COVID-19 deaths.

Since then, surgeries were halted in a bid to prevent transmission. However, since such a long halt is infeasible, a general protocol of screening the carriers, especially asymptomatic carries, is a dire need of time. The objective of our study is to propose an economically feasible protocol of COVID 19 screening. Simple but effective screening strategies can help to restore the workings of hospital surgical departments. Methods We analyzed the clinical data of patients turning up for elective surgeries at the Rawal General Hospital (RGH), Islamabad from the 24th of March to the 15th of May, 2020. Asymptomatic patients with negative COVID 19 contact and travel histories were screened with COVID 19 Immunochromatography (ICT) IgM \/ IgG Ab Test. Complete blood count (CBC) was done and interpreted in conjunction with the ICT results. Results 39 patients with a mean age of 49 years were studied. The result of ICT for COVID-19 was positive in 9 cases (23%). The entire positive ICT patients population expressed significantly lower lymphocyte count (p<0.01); 8 patients had high monocyte count (p<0.05) whereas only 4 patients had a combined high neutrophil and monocyte count (P<0.05). All of these four patients with high neutrophil count were females. The combined interpretation of CBC and ICT IgM \/ IgG Ab Test had a high accuracy in diagnosing asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers that were later confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Conclusion We propose that joint CBC-ICT interpretation should be adopted on a large scale to help in the diagnoses of asymptomatic carriers as both tests are simple and inexpensive and thus suit the developing countries limited health budget. Future research projects should be adopted in order to assess the accuracy of the proposed protocol on a large scale.

COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 and has spread globally. Although Thailand has been effective at controlling the spread of COVID-19, disease surveillance and information on antibody responses in infected cases and close contacts are needed because there is still no specific treatment or vaccine available. We investigated 217 recovered COVID-19 cases to monitor their viral RNA shedding and production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of antibodies in blood samples from 308 close contacts of COVID-19 cases was also determined. Viral RNA was still detectable in 6.6 % of recovered COVID-19 cases. The most prolonged duration of viral RNA shedding detected in this study was 105 days. IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 13.82, 88.48, and 83.41 % of the recovered cases 4-12 weeks after disease onset, respectively. Although the patients had recovered from their illness, the levels of antibodies detected showed association with their symptoms during their stay in hospital. Fifteen of the 308 contacts (4.87 %) of COVID-19 cases tested positive for IgG antibodies. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 suggested that there was viral exposure among close contacts. Viral clearance and the pattern of antibody responses in infected individuals are both crucial for effectively combatting SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides additional information on the natural history of this newly emerging disease related to both natural host defenses and a strategy for vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chintana Chirathaworn","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Manit Sripramote","author_inst":"Medical Service Department, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Piti Chalongviriyalert","author_inst":"Medical Service Department, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Supunee Jirajariyavej","author_inst":"Taksin Hospital"},{"author_name":"Phatharaporn Kiatpanabhikul","author_inst":"Charoenkrung Pracharak Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jatuporn Saiyarin","author_inst":"Klang General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chulikorn Soudon","author_inst":"Sirindhorn Hospital"},{"author_name":"Orawan Thienfaidee","author_inst":"Ratchaphiphat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thitisan Palakawong Na Ayuthaya","author_inst":"Public Health Center 28"},{"author_name":"Chantapat Brukesawan","author_inst":"Public Health Center 26"},{"author_name":"Dootchai Chaiwanichsiri","author_inst":"National Blood Center, Thai Red Cross Society"},{"author_name":"Duangnapa Intharasongkroh","author_inst":"National Blood Center, Thai Red Cross Society"},{"author_name":"Nasamon Wanlapakorn","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Jira Chansaenroj","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Jiratchaya Puenpa","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Ritthideach Yorsaeng","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Arunee Thitithanyanont","author_inst":"Faculty of Science, Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Rungrueng Kitphati","author_inst":"Shanxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Anek Mungaomklang","author_inst":"Institute for Urban Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Pijaya Nagavajara","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Chris Wallace","author_inst":"University of Cambridge & MRC Biostatistics Unit"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC2180) Image-Guided and Functio"},{"author_name":"Melanie Maerklin","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Jonas S.

To the date more than 13 million confirmed cases and more than half a million are dead around the world. This virus also attached Malaysia in its immature stage where 8718 cases were confirmed and 122 were declared as death. Malaysia responsibly controlled the spread by enforcing MCO. Hence, it is required to visualize the pattern of Covid-19 spread. Also, it is necessary to estimate the impact of the enforced prevention measures. In this paper, an infectious disease dynamic modeling (SEIR) is used to estimate the epidemic spread in Malaysia. The main assumption is to update the reproduction number Rt with respect to the implemented prevention measures. For a time-frame of five month, the Rt was assumed to vary between 2.9 and 0.3. Moreover, the manuscript includes two possible scenarios: the first will be the extension of the stricter measures all over the country, and the second will be the gradual lift of the lock-down. After implementing several stages of lock-down we have found that the estimated values of the Rt with respect to the strictness degree varies between 0.2 to 1.1. A continuous strict lock-down may reduce the Rt to 0.2 and accordingly the estimated active cases will be reduced to 20 by the beginning of September 2020. In contrast, the second scenario considers a gradual lift of the enforced prevention measures by the end of June 2020, here we have considered three possible outcomes according to the MCO relaxation. Thus, the estimated values of Rt = 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, which shows a rapid increase in the number of active cases. The implemented SEIR model shows a close resemblance with the actual data recorded from 10, March till 7, July 2020.\n\nAuthor summaryConceptualization, A.A.A; methodology, A.A.A, N.M; validation, A.A.A, N.M; formal analysis, A.A.A; investigation, N.M, A.A.A; resources, G.E.M.A, L.T; data collection, L.T, N.M; writing--original draft preparation, A.A.A, L.T, G.E.M.A, N.M; writing--review and editing, V.S.A, S.C.D, B.S.G, P.S, S.A.B.M.Z, N.M; visualization, N.M; supervision, V.S.A; project administration, V.S.A.

Drug repurposing screening is regarded as one of the most practical and rapid approaches for the discovery of such therapeutics. The 3C like protease (3CLpro), or main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a valid drug target as it is a specific viral enzyme and plays an essential role in viral replication. We performed a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) of 10,755 compounds consisting of approved and investigational drugs, and bioactive compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay. Twenty-three small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro have been identified with IC50s ranging from 0.26 to 28.85 M. Walrycin B (IC50 = 0.26 {micro}M), Hydroxocobalamin (IC50 = 3.29 {micro}M), Suramin sodium (IC50 = 6.5 {micro}M), Z-DEVD-FMK (IC50 = 6.81 {micro}M), LLL-12 (IC50 = 9.84 {micro}M), and Z-FA-FMK (IC50 = 11.39 {micro}M) are the most potent 3CLpro inhibitors. The activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was confirmed in 7 of 23 compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. The results demonstrated a set of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors that may have potential for further clinical evaluation as part of drug combination therapies to treating COVID-19 patients, and as starting points for chemistry optimization for new drug development.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Zhu","author_inst":"NIH\/NCATS"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20850, USA"},{"author_name":"Catherine Z.

As fumigation of vinegar at low concentration (0.34%) ameliorated the symptoms of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested in vitro the potential antiviral activity of vinegar and of its active component, acetic acid. We here demonstrate that both vinegar and acetic acid indeed strongly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero cells. Furthermore, vinegar treatment caused a 90% inhibition of the infectious titer when directly applied to a nasopharyngeal swab transfer medium of a COVID-19 patient. These effects were potentiated if conduced at a temperature of 45 {degrees}C vs. 37 {degrees}C, a condition that is transiently generated in the upper respiratory tract during fumigation. Our findings are consistent and extend the results of studies performed in the early and mid-20th century on the disinfectant capacity of organic acids and can provide an affordable home-made aid to prevent or contain SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isabel Pagani","author_inst":"Viral Pathogenesis and Biosafety Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ghezzi","author_inst":"Viral Pathogenesis and Biosafety Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, School of Medicine, Milano and Laboratory of Microbiology and Virology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano Ita"},{"author_name":"Guido Poli","author_inst":"Viral Pathogenesis and Biosafety Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, School of Medicine, Milano, Ital"},{"author_name":"Mario Bussi","author_inst":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, School of Medicine, Milano and Division of Head and Neck Department, Otorhinolaryngology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele  Scientif"},{"author_name":"Luca Pianta","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, ASST, Cremona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Matteo Trimarchi","author_inst":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, School of Medicine, Milano and Division of Head and Neck Department, Otorhinolaryngology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientifi"},{"author_name":"Elisa Vicenzi","author_inst":"Viral Pathogenesis and Biosafety Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Samuel G.

Mean age (SD) was 35.8(12.0) years, 88.9% were male and 8.7% were Qatari nationals. Overall, 83.6% had no concomitant comorbidity, and 3.0% had 3 or more comorbidities. The overwhelming majority (90.9%) were asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms, with 2.0% having severe or critical illness. Presence of hypertension or diabetes were associated with a higher risk of severe or critical illness. Seven deaths were observed during the time interval studied. The epidemiologic curve indicated two distinct patterns of infection, a larger cluster among expatriate craft and manual workers, and a smaller one among Qatari nationals returning from abroad during the epidemic. Conclusion COVID-19 infections in Qatar started in two distinct clusters, but then became more widespread in the population through community transmission. Infections were mostly asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms and associated with very low mortality. Severe\/critical illness was associated with presence of hypertension or diabetes.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanan M Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu Raddad","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Abdul-Badi Abou-Samra","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Zaina Al Kanaani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Abdullatif Al Khal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Einas Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Salih Al Marri","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Muna Al Masalmani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hamad Eid Al Romaihi","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Sheikh M Al Thani","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ali N Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Robert Owen","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bertollini","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Arunee Thitithanyanont","author_inst":"Faculty of Science, Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Rungrueng Kitphati","author_inst":"Shanxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Anek Mungaomklang","author_inst":"Institute for Urban Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Pijaya Nagavajara","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Chris Wallace","author_inst":"University of Cambridge & MRC Biostatistics Unit"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC2180) Image-Guided and Functio"},{"author_name":"Melanie Maerklin","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Jonas S.

This study aims to provide an overview of the spectrum, characteristics and outcomes of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted a nationwide, multicentric, retrospective study during the French COVID-19 epidemic in March-April 2020. All COVID-19 patients with de novo neurological manifestations were eligible. Results: We included 222 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations from 46 centers throughout the country. Median age was 65 years (IQR 53-72), and 136 patients (61.3%) were male. COVID-19 was severe or critical in almost half of the patients (102, 45.2%). The most common neurological diseases were COVID-19 associated encephalopathy (67\/222, 30.2%), acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (57\/222, 25.7%), encephalitis (21\/222, 9.5%), and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (15\/222, 6.8%). Neurological manifestations appeared after first COVID-19 symptoms with a median (IQR) delay of 6 (3-8) days in COVID-19 associated encephalopathy, 7 (5-10) days in encephalitis, 12 (7-18) days in acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome and 18 (15-28) days in Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Brain imaging was performed in 192 patients (86.5%), including 157 MRI (70.7%). Brain MRI of encephalitis patients showed heterogeneous acute non vascular lesion in 14\/21 patients (66.7%) with associated small ischemic lesion or microhemorrhages in 4 patients. Among patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome, 13\/57 (22.8%) had multi territory ischemic strokes, with large vessel thrombosis in 16\/57 (28.1%). Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed in 97 patients (43.7%), with pleocytosis in 18 patients (18.6%). A SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed in 75 patients and was positive only in 2 encephalitis patients. Among patients with encephalitis, ten out of 21 (47.6%) fully recovered, 3 of whom received corticosteroids (CS). Less common neurological manifestations included isolated seizure (8\/222, 3.6%), critical illness neuropathy (8\/222, 3.6%), transient alteration of consciousness (5\/222, 2.3%), intracranial hemorrhage (5\/222, 2.3%), acute benign lymphocytic meningitis (3\/222, 1.4%), cranial neuropathy (3\/222, 1.4%), single acute demyelinating lesion (2\/222, 0.9%), Tapia syndrome (2\/222, 0.9%), cerebral venous thrombosis (1\/222, 0.5%), sudden paraparesis (1\/222, 0.5%), generalized myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia (1\/222, 0.5%), bilateral fibular palsy (1\/222, 0.5%) and isolated neurological symptoms (headache, anosmia, dizziness, sensitive or auditive symptoms, hiccups, 15\/222, 6.8%). The median (IQR) follow-up of the 222 patients was 24 (17-34) days with a high short-term mortality rate (28\/222, 12.6%). Conclusion: Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 mainly included CAE, AICS, encephalitis and GBS. Clinical spectrum and outcomes were broad and heterogeneous, suggesting different underlying pathogenic processes.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elodie Meppiel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Nathan Peiffer-Smadja","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Maury","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Imen Bekri","author_inst":"Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, F-78150 Le Chesnay, France"},{"author_name":"Cecile Delorme","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Assistance-Publique Hopitaux de Paris, F-75013 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Virginie Desestret","author_inst":"Department of Neuro-cognition and Neuro-ophthalmology, Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Lucas Gorza","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Hautecloque-Raysz","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Sophie Landre","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Anek Mungaomklang","author_inst":"Institute for Urban Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Pijaya Nagavajara","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Chris Wallace","author_inst":"University of Cambridge & MRC Biostatistics Unit"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC2180) Image-Guided and Functio"},{"author_name":"Melanie Maerklin","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Jonas S.

The intensity and timing of a second outbreak is a common concern worldwide. In this study, we made scenario projections of the potential second outbreak of COVID-19 using a statistical-epidemiology model, which considers both the impact of seasonal changes in meteorological elements and human social behaviors such as protests and city unblocking. Recent street protests in the United States and other countries are identified as a hidden trigger and amplifier of the second outbreak. The scale and intensity of subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S. cities where the epidemic is under initial control are projected to be much greater than those of the first outbreak. For countries without reported protests, lifting the COVID-19 related restrictions prematurely would accelerate the spread of the disease and place mounting pressure on the local medical system that is already overloaded. We anticipate these projections will support public health planning and policymaking by governments and international organizations.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianping Huang","author_inst":"Collaborative Innovation Center for Western Ecological Safety"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Liu","author_inst":"Collaborative Innovation Center for Western Ecological Safety"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Collaborative Innovation Center for Western Ecological Safety"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Huang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chuwei Liu","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danfeng Wang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Anek Mungaomklang","author_inst":"Institute for Urban Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Pijaya Nagavajara","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Chris Wallace","author_inst":"University of Cambridge & MRC Biostatistics Unit"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC2180) Image-Guided and Functio"},{"author_name":"Melanie Maerklin","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Jonas S.

Here, we demonstrate that HIT may be greatly reduced if a fraction of the population is unable to transmit the virus due to innate resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses. The drop in HIT is proportional to the fraction of the population resistant only when that fraction is effectively segregated from the general population; however, when mixing is random, the drop in HIT is more precipitous. Significant reductions in expected mortality can also be observed in settings where a fraction of the population is resistant to infection. These results help to explain the large degree of regional variation observed in seroprevalence and cumulative deaths and suggest that sufficient herd-immunity may already be in place to substantially mitigate a potential second wave.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Lourenco","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Francesco Pinotti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Craig Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Huang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chuwei Liu","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danfeng Wang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Anek Mungaomklang","author_inst":"Institute for Urban Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Pijaya Nagavajara","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Chris Wallace","author_inst":"University of Cambridge & MRC Biostatistics Unit"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC2180) Image-Guided and Functio"},{"author_name":"Melanie Maerklin","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Jonas S.

All this components affect the SARS-COV-2 spreading patterns simultaneously being not possible to observe environmental seasonality not associated intrinsically with policies\/ALE and urban spaces, therefore conferring to these three forms of transmission spreading patterns, specific regions of analysis for time series data extraction.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charles Roberto Telles","author_inst":"Secretary of State for Education and Sport of Parana"},{"author_name":"Francesco Pinotti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Craig Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Huang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chuwei Liu","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danfeng Wang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Anek Mungaomklang","author_inst":"Institute for Urban Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Pijaya Nagavajara","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Chris Wallace","author_inst":"University of Cambridge & MRC Biostatistics Unit"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC2180) Image-Guided and Functio"},{"author_name":"Melanie Maerklin","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Jonas S.

Design: Demographic analysis of all-cause mortality from week 1 through week 26 of 2020 using publicly available death registration data from the Office for National Statistics. Setting and population: England and Wales population by age and sex in 2020. Main outcome measure: Age and sex-specific excess mortality risk and deaths above a baseline adjusted for seasonality in the first half of 2020. We additionally provide estimates of life expectancy at birth and lifespan inequality defined as the standard deviation in age at death. Results: We estimate that there have been 53,937 (95% Prediction Interval: 53,092, 54,746) excess deaths in the first half of 2020, 54% of which occurred in men. Excess deaths increased sharply with age and men experienced elevated risks of death in all age groups. Life expectancy at birth dropped 1.7 and 1.9 years for females and males relative to the 2019 levels, respectively. Lifespan inequality also fell over the same period. Conclusions: Quantifying excess deaths and their impact on life expectancy at birth provides a more comprehensive picture of the full COVID-19 burden on mortality. Whether mortality will return to - or even fall below - the baseline level remains to be seen as the pandemic continues to unfold and diverse interventions are put in place.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Manuel Aburto","author_inst":"University of Oxford and University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Ridhi Kashyap","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jonas Scholey","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Colin Angus","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"John Ermisch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Melinda Mills","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Beam Dowd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danfeng Wang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Anek Mungaomklang","author_inst":"Institute for Urban Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Pijaya Nagavajara","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Chris Wallace","author_inst":"University of Cambridge & MRC Biostatistics Unit"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC2180) Image-Guided and Functio"},{"author_name":"Melanie Maerklin","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Jonas S.

Design: A cross-sectional survey collecting data in Hong Kong and Fujian Province of China. Self-administered questionnaires were collected via online platform in April 2020. Participants: A convenience and snowball sample of 2706 students aged 18 years or older and studying a healthcare programme in Hong Kong or Fujian. Setting: Students were recruited in tertiary education institutions\/universities in Hong Kong and Putian (a prefecture-level city in eastern Fujian province). The institutions offered various healthcare programmes in degree or sub-degree levels. Main outcome measures: Compliances to social distancing and personal hygiene measures were assessed by 10-item Social Distancing Scale and 5-item Personal Hygiene Scale respectively. Path analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the compliance outcomes. Results: The participants reported high compliances to both social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Confidence to manage the current situation, wishful thinking and empathetic responding directly predicted compliance to social distancing ({beta}=-0.31, p<0.001; {beta}=0.35, p=0.015; {beta}=0.33, p<0.001 respectively) and personal hygiene measures ({beta}=-0.16, p<0.001; {beta}=0.21, p<0.001; {beta}=0.16, p<0.001 respectively). Gender, geographical location, and clinical experience were the only three demographic variables having direct and\/or indirect effects on social distancing and personal hygiene measures. The final model constructed demonstrated a very good fit to the data (Chi-square X2=27.27, df=17, P=0.044; X2\/df=1.61; GFI=0.998, CFI=0.997, TLI=0.992, RMSEA=0.015). Conclusions: The predictive model constructed in this study is the first one to explore factors associating with the compliance to infection control measures in healthcare students amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings suggest that students who are male, habituate in Hong Kong, have more clinical experience and weak confidence to manage the threat tend to have lower compliance to social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Wishful thinking, contrasting to previous studies, was first found to positively associate with adherence to COVID-19 control measures.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anson Chui Yan Tang","author_inst":"Tung Wah College"},{"author_name":"Enid Wai Yung Kwong","author_inst":"Putian College"},{"author_name":"Liangying Chen","author_inst":"Putian College"},{"author_name":"Winnie Lai Sheung Cheng","author_inst":"Tung Wah College"},{"author_name":"John Ermisch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Melinda Mills","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Beam Dowd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danfeng Wang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Anek Mungaomklang","author_inst":"Institute for Urban Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Pijaya Nagavajara","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Chris Wallace","author_inst":"University of Cambridge & MRC Biostatistics Unit"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC2180) Image-Guided and Functio"},{"author_name":"Melanie Maerklin","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Jonas S.

First infections were reported in Germany by the end of January and on March 16th the federal government announced a partial lockdown in order to mitigate the spread. Since the dynamics of new infections started to slow down, German states started to relax the confinement measures as to the beginning of May. As a fall back option, a limit of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days was introduced for each city or district in Germany. If a district exceeds this limit, measures to control the spread of the virus should be taken. Based on a multi--patch SEAIRD--type model, we will simulate the effect of choosing a specific upper limit for new infections. We investigate, whether the politically motivated bound is low enough to detect new outbreaks at an early stage. Subsequently, we introduce an optimal control problem to tackle the multi--criteria problem of finding a bound for new infections that is low enough to avoid new outbreaks, which might lead to an overload of the health care system, but is large enough to curb the expected economic losses.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wolfgang Bock","author_inst":"Technische Universitaet Kaiserslautern"},{"author_name":"Thomas Goetz","author_inst":"University Koblenz"},{"author_name":"Yashika Jayathunga","author_inst":"University Koblenz"},{"author_name":"Robert Rockenfeller","author_inst":"University Koblenz"},{"author_name":"John Ermisch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Melinda Mills","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Beam Dowd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danfeng Wang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Anek Mungaomklang","author_inst":"Institute for Urban Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok"},{"author_name":"Pijaya Nagavajara","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Chris Wallace","author_inst":"University of Cambridge & MRC Biostatistics Unit"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC2180) Image-Guided and Functio"},{"author_name":"Melanie Maerklin","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Jonas S.

Exercise tests administered remotely were the 6MWT (2 studies) and step test (1 study). Compared to centre-based testing the 6MWT distance was similar when performed outdoors but shorter when performed at home (2 studies). The STS, TUG and step tests were feasible, reliable (intra-class correlation coefficients >0.80), valid (concurrent and known groups validity) and moderately responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation (medium effect sizes). These tests elicited less desaturation than the 6MWT, and validated methods to prescribe exercise were not reported. Discussion: The STS, step and TUG tests can be performed at home, but do not accurately document desaturation with walking or allow exercise prescription. Patients at risk of desaturation should be prioritised for centre-based exercise testing when this is available.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anne E Holland","author_inst":"Monash University and Alfred Health"},{"author_name":"Carla Malaguti","author_inst":"Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Mariana Hoffman","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Aroub Lahham","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Angela T Burge","author_inst":"Monash University and Alfred Health"},{"author_name":"Leona Dowman","author_inst":"Monash University and Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony K May","author_inst":"Monash University and Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Janet Bondarenko","author_inst":"Alfred Health"},{"author_name":"Marnie Graco","author_inst":"Alfred Health and Institute for Breathing and Sleep"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Tikellis","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Y.T.

OBJECTIVES\/METHODS: Healthcare worker interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tracked using a real time location system between March 18 and March 31. A value for q, the transmissibility expressed as quanta per hour, was estimated using a well-established model for airborne transmission. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among tracked HCWs was 2.21% (0.07-4.35). Transmissibility was estimated to be 0.225 quanta per hour, well below other well-characterized airborne pathogens. Simulations demonstrated that risk of infection is substantially reduced with increased ventilation of rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not well transmitted via the airborne route in controlled conditions. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be only opportunistically airborne, with most transmission occurring via droplet methods.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bala Hota","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brian Stein","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Lin","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alex Tomich","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Segreti","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Robert A Weinstein","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony K May","author_inst":"Monash University and Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Janet Bondarenko","author_inst":"Alfred Health"},{"author_name":"Marnie Graco","author_inst":"Alfred Health and Institute for Breathing and Sleep"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Tikellis","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Y.T.

More than 50% of patients with COVID-19 that receive invasive treatment such as mechanical ventilation will die in hospital. Such impacts overwhelm the limited intensive care unit resources and may lead to further deaths given inadequate access to care. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is defined as breathing 100% oxygen at a pressure higher than 1.4 atmosphere absolute (ATA). HBOT is safe, including for lungs, when administered by experienced teams and is routinely administrated for a number of approved indications. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests clinical improvement when hypoxemic COVID-19 patients are treated with HBOT. Objective: We aim to determine the effectiveness of HBOT for improving oxygenation, morbidity, and mortality among hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Methods and analysis: This trial is a sequential Bayesian Parallel-group, individually Randomized, Open, Blinded Endpoint controlled trial. Admitted hypoxemic COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen (without high flow and mechanical ventilation) to maintain a satisfying tissue oxygenation will be eligible to participate. The anticipated sample size of 234 patients is informed by data from a treatment trial of COVID patients recently published. The intervention group will receive one HBOT per day at 2.0 ATA for 75 minutes. Daily HBOT will be administered until either the patient does not require any oxygen supplementation or requires any type of mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygenation until day 28 post-randomization. Patients in the control group will receive the current standard of care treatment (no HBOT). The primary outcome of this trial will be the 7-level COVID ordinal outcomes scale assessed on Day 7 post-randomization. Secondary outcomes will include: (a) clinical outcomes (length of hospital stay, days with oxygen supplementation, oxygen flow values to obtain a saturation by pulse oximetry [&ge;]90%, intensive care admission and length of stay, days on invasive mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygen, sleep quality, fatigue, major thrombotic events, the 7-level COVID ordinal outcomes scale on Day 28; mortality, safety); (b) biological outcomes (plasma inflammatory markers); and (c) health system outcomes (cost of care and cost-effectiveness). Predetermined inclusion\/exclusion criteria have been specified. The analytical approach for the primary outcome will use a Bayesian proportional odds ordinal logistic semiparametric model. The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Bayesian posterior probabilities will be calculated every 20 patients to assess accumulating evidence for benefit or harm. A planned subgroup analysis will be performed for pre-specified variables known to impact COVID-19 prognosis and\/or HBOT (biologic sex and age). Discussion: Based on the mortality rate and substantial burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare system, it is imperative that solutions be found. HBOT is a non-invasive and low-risk intervention when contraindications are respected. The established safety and relatively low cost of providing HBOT along with its potential to improve the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients make this intervention worth studying, despite the current limited number of HBOT centres. If this trial finds that HBOT significantly improves outcome and prevents further deterioration leading to critical care for severe COVID-19 patients, practice will change internationally. If no benefit is found from the intervention, then the current standard of care (no HBOT) will be supported by level I evidence.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sylvain Boet","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rita Katznelson","author_inst":"Toronto General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lana A.

The aim of this study was to describe national, 60-day all-cause mortality associated with COVID-19, and to identify risk factors associated with admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Methods This was a retrospective cohort study including the first consecutive 5000 patients with COVID-19 in Qatar who completed 60 days of follow up by June 17, 2020. Outcomes included all-cause mortality at 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, and risk factors for admission to ICU. Results Included patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 28 and April 17, 2020. The majority (4436, 88.7%) were males and the median age was 35 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28-43]. By 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, 14 patients (0.28%) had died, 10 (0.2%) were still in hospital, and two (0.04%) were still in ICU. Fatal COVID-19 cases had a median age of 59.5 years (IQR 55.8-68), and were mostly males (13, 92.9%). All included pregnant women (26, 0.5%), children (131, 2.6%), and healthcare workers (135, 2.7%) were alive and not hospitalized at the end of follow up. A total of 1424 patients (28.5%) required hospitalization, out of which 108 (7.6%) were admitted to ICU. Most frequent co-morbidities in hospitalized adults were diabetes (23.2%), and hypertension (20.7%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.041, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022-1.061 per year increase; P <0.001], male sex (aOR 4.375, 95% CI 1.964-9.744; P <0.001), diabetes (aOR 1.698, 95% CI 1.050-2.746; P 0.031), chronic kidney disease (aOR 3.590, 95% CI 1.596-8.079, P 0.002), and higher BMI (aOR 1.067, 95% CI 1.027-1.108 per unit increase; P 0.001), were all independently associated with increased risk of ICU admission. Conclusions In a relatively younger national cohort with a low co-morbidity burden, COVID-19 was associated with low all-cause mortality. Independent risk factors for ICU admission included older age, male sex, higher BMI, and co-existing diabetes or chronic kidney disease.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali S.

This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions. Method We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a five-week period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population Result Of the 1,070 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 496 critically ill patients were hospitalized and included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (53%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the 'obese' range. 97% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (84%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (57%) and chronic kidney disease (24%). Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease who received hemodialysis were found to have significantly lower mortality, then those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis (11%, OR, 0.35, CI, 0.17 - 0.69 P=0.001). Age >60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD\/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg\/L), LDH (551, 638 U\/L), glucose (182, 163 mg\/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng\/mL), and neutrophil \/ lymphocyte ratio (8.5, 10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 hrs. Of the 496 inpatients, 48% died, one third of patients died within the first three days of admission. 54\/488 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 87% died and of the remaining patients, 32% died. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors\/ARBs improved patient outcomes.

We aim to estimate time-dependent transmissibility of COVID-19 for India using a reproducible framework. Methods: Daily COVID-19 case incidence time series for India and its states were obtained from https:\/\/api.covid19india.org\/ and pre-processed. The Bayesian approach was adopted to quantify transmissibility at a given location and time, as indicated by the instantaneous reproduction number (Reff). The analysis was carried out in R version 4.0.2 using -EpiEstim_2.2-3- package. Serial interval distribution was estimated using -uncertain_si- algorithm with inputs of mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of mean serial intervals as 5.1, 1.2, 3.9 and 7.5 days respectively; and mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of standard deviations of the serial interval as 3.7, 0.9, 2.3, and 4.7 respectively with 100 simulations and moving average of seven days. Results. A total of 9,07,544 cumulative incident cases till July 13th, 2020 were analysed. Daily COVID-19 incidence in the country was seen on the rise; however, transmissibility showed a decline from the initial phases of COVID-19 pandemic in India. The maximum Reff reached at the national level during the study period was 2.57 (sliding week ending April 4th, 2020). Reff on July 13th, 2020 for India was 1.16 with a range from 0.59 to 2.98 across various states\/UTs. Conclusion. Reff provides critical feedback for assessment of transmissibility of COVID-19 and thus is a potential dynamic decision support tool for on-ground public health decision making","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gurpreet Singh","author_inst":"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum"},{"author_name":"Seema Patrikar","author_inst":"Armed Forces Medical College, Pune."},{"author_name":"PS Sarma","author_inst":"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum."},{"author_name":"Biju Soman","author_inst":"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum."},{"author_name":"Donghai Wang","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Diks","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Alshal","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dokpe Yvonne Emechebe","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.

The model can be used to explain slower approaching herd immunity in Sweden, than it was predicted by a variety of other mathematical models; see graphs Fig. 2. The hierarchic structure of social clusters is mathematically modeled with ultrametric spaces having treelike geometry. To simplify mathematics, we consider homogeneous trees with p-branches leaving each vertex. Such trees are endowed with algebraic structure, the p-adic number fields. We apply theory of the p-adic diffusion equation to describe coronavirus' spread in hierarchically clustered population. This equation has applications to statistical physics and microbiology for modeling dynamics on energy landscapes. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy's levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing barriers. This structure matches with mild regulations in Sweden. The virus spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This behavior matches with the covid-19 epidemic, with its cluster spreading structure. Our model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. We present socio-medical specialties of the covid-19 epidemic supporting our purely diffusional model.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrei Khrennikov","author_inst":"Linnaeus University"},{"author_name":"Seema Patrikar","author_inst":"Armed Forces Medical College, Pune."},{"author_name":"PS Sarma","author_inst":"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum."},{"author_name":"Biju Soman","author_inst":"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum."},{"author_name":"Donghai Wang","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Diks","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Alshal","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dokpe Yvonne Emechebe","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.

Strict lockdown policies were necessary to contain the first outbreak wave and prevent the Italian healthcare system from being overwhelmed by patients requiring intensive care. After the progressive reopening, predicting how the epidemic situation will evolve is urgent and fundamental to control any future outbreak and prevent a second wave. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to repeatedly calibrate the SIDARTHE model with data up to June 24th. The computed parameter distributions allow us to robustly analyse how the epidemic situation evolved and outline possible future scenarios. Assuming a seasonal regime for COVID-19, we tested different lockdown policies. Our results suggest that an intermittent lockdown where six \"open days\" are allowed every other week may prevent a resurgent exponential outbreak and, at the same time, ease the societal burden of an extensive lockdown.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giulia Simoni","author_inst":"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)"},{"author_name":"Anna Fochesato","author_inst":"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)"},{"author_name":"Federico Reali","author_inst":"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)"},{"author_name":"Giulia Giordano","author_inst":"Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Trento"},{"author_name":"Enrico Domenici","author_inst":"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)"},{"author_name":"Luca Marchetti","author_inst":"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Alshal","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dokpe Yvonne Emechebe","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.

Correcting for possible confounders, we estimated their causal effects on reported case numbers. To this end, we used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as a graphical representation of the hypothesized causal effects of the aforementioned determinants on new reported cases of COVID-19. Based on this, we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors. We collected data for Germany from publicly available sources (e.g. Robert Koch Institute, Germany's National Meteorological Service, Google) for 401 German districts over the period of 15 February to 8 July 2020, and estimated total causal effects based on our DAG analysis by negative binomial regression. Our analysis revealed favorable causal effects of increasing temperature, increased public mobility for essential shopping (grocery and pharmacy), and awareness measured by COVID-19 burden, all of them reducing the outcome of newly reported COVID-19 cases. Conversely, we saw adverse effects of public mobility in retail and recreational areas, awareness measured by searches for \"corona\" in Google, and higher rainfall, leading to an increase in new COVID-19 cases. This comprehensive causal analysis of a variety of determinants affecting COVID-19 progression gives strong evidence for the driving forces of mobility, public awareness, and temperature, whose implications need to be taken into account for future decisions regarding pandemic management.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edgar Steiger","author_inst":"Central Research Institute of Ambulatory Health Care in Germany (Zi)"},{"author_name":"Tobias Mussgnug","author_inst":"Central Research Institute of Ambulatory Health Care in Germany (Zi)"},{"author_name":"Lars Eric Kroll","author_inst":"Central Research Institute of Ambulatory Health Care in Germany (Zi)"},{"author_name":"Giulia Giordano","author_inst":"Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Trento"},{"author_name":"Enrico Domenici","author_inst":"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)"},{"author_name":"Luca Marchetti","author_inst":"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Alshal","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dokpe Yvonne Emechebe","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.
