Here, we analyze the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Russia in March and April 2020. Combining phylogeographic analysis with travel history data, we estimate that the sampled viral diversity has originated from 67 closely timed introductions into Russia, mostly in late February to early March. All but one of these introductions came from non-Chinese sources, suggesting that border closure with China has helped delay establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in Russia. These introductions resulted in at least 9 distinct Russian lineages corresponding to domestic transmission. A notable transmission cluster corresponded to a nosocomial outbreak at the Vreden hospital in Saint Petersburg; phylodynamic analysis of this cluster reveals multiple (2-4) introductions each giving rise to a large number of cases, with a high initial effective reproduction number of 3.7 (2.5-5.0).","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrey B Komissarov","author_inst":"Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza, Russia"},{"author_name":"Ksenia R Safina","author_inst":"Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Russia"},{"author_name":"Sofya K Garushyants","author_inst":"A.A.

The aim of this work is to estimate the true number of SARS-CoV-2 (detected and undetected) infections in several European Countries. The question being asked is: How many cases have actually occurred? Methods: We propose an upper bound estimator under cumulative data distributions, in an open population, based on a day-wise estimator that allows for heterogeneity. The estimator is data-driven and can be easily computed from the distributions of daily cases and deaths. Uncertainty surrounding the estimates is obtained using bootstrap methods. Results: We focus on the ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases at April 17th. Differences arise at the Country level, and we get estimates ranging from the 3.93 times of Norway to the 7.94 times of France. Accurate estimates are obtained, as bootstrap based intervals are rather narrow. Conclusions: Many parametric or semi-parametric models have been developed to estimate the population size from aggregated counts leading to an approximation of the missed population and\/or to the estimate of the threshold under which the number of missed people cannot fall (i.e. a lower bound). Here, we provide a methodological contribution introducing an upper bound estimator and provide reliable estimates on the dark number, i.e. how many undetected cases are going around for several European Countries, where the epidemic spreads differently.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Irene Rocchetti","author_inst":"Statistical Office"},{"author_name":"Dankmar Boehning","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Heinz Holling","author_inst":"University of Muenster"},{"author_name":"Antonello Maruotti","author_inst":"Libera Universit\u00e0 Ss Maria Assunta"},{"author_name":"Chandra Mohan","author_inst":"Government of Tamil Nadu, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"S Neelima","author_inst":"Guntur Medical College, Andhra Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"K.

Design Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. Setting 260 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17th January and 5th June 2020, with a minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 19th June 2020). Participants 451 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 116 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcome Measures Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C. Results Median age was 3.9 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.3-12.9 years], 36% (162\/451) were under 12 months old, and 57% (256\/450) were male. 56% (224\/401) were White, 12% (49\/401) South Asian and 10% (40\/401) Black. 43% (195\/451) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A muco-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, closely mirroring the WHO MIS-C criteria. 17% of children (72\/431) were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis this was associated with age under one month odds ratio 5.05 (95% confidence interval 1.69 to 15.72, p=0.004), age 10 to 14 years OR 3.11 (1.21 to 8.55, p=0.022) and Black ethnicity OR 3.02 (1.30 to 6.84, p=0.008). Three young people died (0.7 %, 3\/451) aged 16 to 19 years, all of whom had profound comorbidity. Twelve percent of children (36\/303) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Those meeting MIS-C criteria were older, (median age 10.8 years ([IQR 8.4-14.1] vs 2.0 [0.2-12.6]), p<0.001) and more likely to be of non-White ethnicity (70% (23\/33) vs 43% (101\/237), p=0.005). Children with MIS-C were four times more likely to be admitted to critical care (61% (22\/36) vs 15% (40\/267, p<0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with headache (45% (13\/29) vs 11% (19\/171), p<0.001), myalgia (39% (11\/28) vs 7% (12\/170), p<0.001), sore throat (37% (10\/27) vs (13% (24\/183, p = 0.004) and fatigue (57% (17\/30) vs 31% (60\/192), p =0.012) than children who did not and to have a platelet count of less than 150 x109\/L (30% (10\/33) vs 10% (24\/232), p=0.004). Conclusions Our data confirms less severe covid-19 in children and young people than in adults and we provide additional evidence for refining the MIS-C case definition. The identification of a muco-enteric symptom cluster also raises the suggestion that MIS-C is the severe end of a spectrum of disease.

Objectives: To assess outcomes following COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those without in a contemporaneous age, sex and comorbidity matched population. Methods: An international multicentre audit of patients with a prior diagnosis of ILD admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 1 May 2020 was undertaken and compared with patients, without ILD obtained from the ISARIC 4C cohort, admitted with COVID-19 over the same period. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary analysis distinguished IPF from non-IPF ILD and used lung function to determine the greatest risks of death. Measurements and Main Results: Data from 349 patients with ILD across Europe were included, of whom 161 were admitted to hospital with laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID-19 and eligible for propensity-score matching. Overall mortality was 49% (79\/161) in patients with ILD with COVID-19. After matching ILD patients with COVID-19 had higher mortality (HR 1.60, Confidence Intervals 1.17-2.18 p=0.003) compared with age, sex and co-morbidity matched controls without ILD. Patients with a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of <80% had an increased risk of death versus patients with FVC [&ge;]80% (HR 1.72, 1.05-2.83). Furthermore, obese patients with ILD had an elevated risk of death (HR 1.98, 1.13-3.46). Conclusions: Patients with ILD are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, particularly those with poor lung function and obesity. Stringent precautions should be taken to avoid COVID-19 in patients with ILD.","rel_num_authors":70,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gisli Jenkins","author_inst":"University of

Here, we show results from the first in-human trials using non-invasive ultrasound stimulation of the spleen to reduce cytokine release in the context of both an acute response in healthy subjects and a chronic inflammatory condition in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Splenic ultrasound results in a reduction in TNF serum levels, as well as IL-1B; and IL-8 transcript levels in monocytes. There is also a down regulation of pathways involved in TNF and IL-6 production, and IFNgamma- and NFKB-regulated genes. Many of these cytokines or pathways are upregulated in COVID-19 patients. There is also a reduction in chemokine transcript levels and other components of the chemotactic response, suggesting that reduction of cellular migration may contribute to the therapeutic effects of ultrasound. There is no inhibition of the adaptive immune response with ultrasound treatment relating to antibody production. This is consistent with a pre-clinical animal model where enhanced antibody production was achieved with splenic ultrasound. Therefore, this new splenic ultrasound approach has the potential to treat acute and chronic hyper-inflammatory diseases, as it lowers cytokine levels without disrupting the normal adaptive immune response. Portable ultrasound technologies are currently being developed and translated to the clinic to treat various inflammatory disorders, with more recent efforts directed towards combatting the hyperinflammation or cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel Stegeman Graham","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Daniel P Zachs","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Victoria Cotero","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Catherine DAgostino","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Despoina Ntiloudi","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Claire RW Kaiser","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"John Graf","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Kirk Wallace","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Coleman","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research,"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Ashe","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"John Pellerito","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kevin J Tracey","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Bryce Binstadt","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta S Chavan","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stavros Zanos","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Puleo","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Erik Peterson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Hubert H Lim","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Louise Crowley","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Davinder Dosanjh","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Christine Fiddler","author_inst":"Cambridge Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0AY, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian A Forrest","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4LP, UK."},{"author_name":"Peter George","author_inst":"Royal Brompton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Gibbons","author_inst":"South West Peninsula ILD Network, Royal Devon & Exeter Foundation NHS Trust Barrack Road, Exeter EX2 5DW, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Groom","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London W12 0HS, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Haney","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Simon Hart","author_inst":"Respiratory Research Group, Hull York Medical School, Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, UK, HU16 5JQ"},{"author_name":"Emily Heiden","author_inst":"University Hospitals Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Henry","author_inst":"Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ling-Pei Ho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hoyles","author_inst":"Oxford Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Killian Hurley","author_inst":"Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Mark Jones","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre & Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Jones","author_inst":"Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis"},{"author_name":"Maria Kokosi","author_inst":"Guys and St Thomas' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Kreuter","author_inst":"Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Pneumology, Thoraxklinik, University of Heidelberg, Germany and German Center for Lung Research, 69126 Heidelber"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Method: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the North Memorial Health Hospital, Robbinsdale, MN, USA Results: Three patients (two men and one woman, aged 38 - 63) presented with fatigue, cough and fever leading to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 infection requiring intubation and ventilatory support. Two patients were unresponsive, one with strong eye deviation to the left and the third patient had severe diffuse weakness. MRI in all patients showed findings consistent with ADEM. CSF showed elevated protein in all patients with normal cell count and no evidence of infection, including negative COVID-19 PCR. All three of the patients received Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19. All patients were treated with intravenous corticosteroids and improved, although two responded minimally. Two patients treated with IVIG showed no further improvement. Conclusion: Neurological complications from COVID-19 are being rapidly recognized. Our three cases highlight the occurrence of ADEM as a postinfectious\/immune mediated complication of COVID-19 infection, which may be responsive to corticosteroid treatment. Early recognition of this complication and treatment is important to avoid long term complications.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michaela McCuddy","author_inst":"Department of Family Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Praful Kelkar","author_inst":"Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhao","author_inst":"Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology"},{"author_name":"David Wicklund","author_inst":"Minneapolis Radiology"},{"author_name":"Despoina Ntiloudi","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Claire RW Kaiser","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"John Graf","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Kirk Wallace","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Coleman","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research,"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Ashe","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"John Pellerito","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kevin J Tracey","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Bryce Binstadt","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta S Chavan","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stavros Zanos","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Puleo","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Erik Peterson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Hubert H Lim","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Louise Crowley","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Davinder Dosanjh","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Christine Fiddler","author_inst":"Cambridge Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0AY, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian A Forrest","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4LP, UK."},{"author_name":"Peter George","author_inst":"Royal Brompton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Gibbons","author_inst":"South West Peninsula ILD Network, Royal Devon & Exeter Foundation NHS Trust Barrack Road, Exeter EX2 5DW, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Groom","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London W12 0HS, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Haney","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Simon Hart","author_inst":"Respiratory Research Group, Hull York Medical School, Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, UK, HU16 5JQ"},{"author_name":"Emily Heiden","author_inst":"University Hospitals Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Henry","author_inst":"Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ling-Pei Ho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hoyles","author_inst":"Oxford Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Killian Hurley","author_inst":"Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Mark Jones","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre & Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Jones","author_inst":"Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis"},{"author_name":"Maria Kokosi","author_inst":"Guys and St Thomas' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Kreuter","author_inst":"Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Pneumology, Thoraxklinik, University of Heidelberg, Germany and German Center for Lung Research, 69126 Heidelber"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Classified as essential, such workers cannot shelter at home. Therefore, knowledge and preventive behaviors are important to reduce COVID-19 spread in the community. (2) Methods: Respondents for 67 families with at least one farmworker (FWF) and 38 comparable families with no farmworkers (non-FWF) in North Carolina completed a telephone survey in May, 2020. The survey queried knowledge of COVID-19, perceptions of its severity, self-efficacy, and preventive behaviors. Detailed data were collected to document household members' social interaction and use of face coverings. (3) Results: Knowledge of COVID-19 and prevention methods was high in both groups, as was its perceived severity. Non-FWF had higher self-efficacy for preventing infection. Both groups claimed to practice preventive behaviors, though FWF emphasized social avoidance and non-FWF emphasized personal hygiene. Detailed social interactions showed high rates of inter-personal contact at home, at work, and in the community with more mask use in non-FWF than FWF. (4) Conclusions: Despite high levels of knowledge and perceived severity for COVID-19, these immigrant families were engaged in frequent interpersonal contact that could expose community members and themselves to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara A.

The world average for the coefficient that linearises the level of transmission with respect to the OxCGRT stringency index is s= 0.01{+\/-}0.0017 (95%C.I.). The corresponding South African coefficient is s= 0.0078{+\/-}0.00036 (95%C.I.), compatible with the world average. Here, we implement the stringency index for the recently announced 5-tier regulatory alert system. Predictions are made for the spread of the virus for each alert level. Assuming constant rates of recovery and mortality, it is essential to increase s. For the system to remain sub-critical, the rate with which s increases should outpace that of the decrease of the stringency index. Monitoring of s becomes essential to controlling the post-lockdown phase.

We therefore performed a SARS-CoV-2 seropraevalence-study in students and teachers to assess their role in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methods: Students grade 8-11 and their teachers in 13 secondary schools in eastern Saxony, Germany, were invited to participate in the SchoolCoviDD19 study. Blood samples were collected between May 25th and June 30th, 2020. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were assed using chemiluminescence immunoassay technology and all samples with a positive or equivocal test result were re-tested with two additional serological tests. Findings: 1538 students and 507 teachers participated in this study. The seropraevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 0.6%. Even in schools with reported Covid-19 cases before the Lockdown of March 13th no clusters could be identified. 23\/24 participants with a household history of COVID-91 were seronegative. By using a combination of three different immunoassays we could exclude 16 participants with a positive or equivocal results after initial testing. Interpretation: Students and teachers do not play a crucial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a low prevalence setting. Transmission in families occurs very infrequently, and the number of unreported cases is low in this age group, making school closures not appear appropriate as a strategy in this low prevalence settings.

High number of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are available in different formats, detect different types of antibodies, and use different target proteins. Sensitivity of these tests varies and could be also related to clinical symptoms and testing time. Methods. Serum samples from 97 COVID-19 patients and 100 controls were tested with 9 antibody tests (SNIBE, Epitope, Euroimmun, Roche, Abbott, DiaSorin, Biosensor, LIPS N, and LIPS S-RBD). The results were analyzed in context of clinical data. Findings. Positivity rate was of tests was following: N-LIPS test (91.8% cases), Epitope (85.6%), Abbott and in-house LIPS S-RBD (both 84.5%), Roche (83.5%), Euroimmun (82.5%), DiaSorin (81.4%), SNIBE (70.1%), and Biosensor (64.9%). Agreement between tests varied (71-95%). Correlation between patient symptoms score and antibody value was test-dependent: varied from strongest in LIPS N (rho=0.41; p<0.001) to nonsignificant (LIPS S-RBD). Testing time from symptoms influenced sensitivity in some tests more than anothers. Interpretation. Sensitivity of tests varied highly and combination of different tests may improve it. Relation of results to symptoms and testing time was test-dependent. Thus, some antibody tests seems to be more sensitive to detect antibodies early and in asymptomatic patients than others. Funding.

However, in spite of extensive discussions, very few places have even attempted to implement it. We evaluated the efficacy of widespread testing in creating a safe workplace in our healthcare community including staff and patients. Furthermore, we assessed the rate of new infections in patients undergoing electrophysiology (EP) procedure, to see if identification and exclusion of positive cases facilitated establishment of a risk-free operating environment. Methods: Universal testing was conducted in subjects with no symptoms of COVID-19 including patients and their caregivers and staff in our electrophysiology units along with the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) staff (n=1670) Results: Of 1670, 758 (45.4%) were EP patients, and the remaining 912 were caregivers, EMS staff and hospital staff from EP clinic and lab. Viral-RNA test revealed 64 (3.8%) positives in the population. A significant increase in the rate of positives was observed from April to June, 2020 (p=0.02). Procedures of positive cases (n=31) were postponed until they tested negative at retesting on day 14. Staff testing positive (n=33) were retested before going back to work after 2 weeks. Because of suspected exposure, 67 staff were retested and source was traced. No new infections were reported in patients during the hospital stay or within 2-weeks after the procedure. Conclusion: Universal testing to identify positive cases was helpful in creating and maintaining a safe working environment without exposing patients and staff to new infections in the EP unit at the hospital.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanghamitra Mohanty","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy","author_inst":"Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute"},{"author_name":"Chintan Trivedi","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Bryan MacDonald","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Angel Mayedo","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Domenico G Della Rocca","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Gopinathannair","author_inst":"Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute"},{"author_name":"Gerald J Gallinghouse","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Luigi Di Biase","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Rodney Horton","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Robert Canby","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Andrea Natale","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute, St."},{"author_name":"Bryce Binstadt","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta S Chavan","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stavros Zanos","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Puleo","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Erik Peterson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Hubert H Lim","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Louise Crowley","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Davinder Dosanjh","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Christine Fiddler","author_inst":"Cambridge Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0AY, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian A Forrest","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4LP, UK."},{"author_name":"Peter George","author_inst":"Royal Brompton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Gibbons","author_inst":"South West Peninsula ILD Network, Royal Devon & Exeter Foundation NHS Trust Barrack Road, Exeter EX2 5DW, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Groom","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London W12 0HS, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Haney","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Simon Hart","author_inst":"Respiratory Research Group, Hull York Medical School, Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, UK, HU16 5JQ"},{"author_name":"Emily Heiden","author_inst":"University Hospitals Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Henry","author_inst":"Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ling-Pei Ho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hoyles","author_inst":"Oxford Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Killian Hurley","author_inst":"Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Mark Jones","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre & Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Jones","author_inst":"Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis"},{"author_name":"Maria Kokosi","author_inst":"Guys and St Thomas' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Kreuter","author_inst":"Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Pneumology, Thoraxklinik, University of Heidelberg, Germany and German Center for Lung Research, 69126 Heidelber"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Design: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D for ARI prevention using a random effects model. Pre-specified sub-group analyses were done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration or dosing regimen. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Standard RCT Number (ISRCTN) registry from inception to May 2020. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies: Double-blind RCTs of supplementation with vitamin D or calcidiol, of any duration, were eligible if they were approved by a Research Ethics Committee and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and pre-specified as an efficacy outcome. Results: We identified 40 eligible RCTs (total 30,956 participants, aged 0 to 95 years). Data were obtained for 29,841 (96.5%) of 30,909 participants in 39 studies. For the primary comparison of vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo, the intervention reduced risk of ARI overall (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98; P for heterogeneity 0.009). No statistically significant effect of vitamin D was seen for any of the sub-groups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration. However, protective effects were seen for trials in which vitamin D was given using a daily dosing regimen (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93); at daily dose equivalents of 400-1000 IU (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89); and for a duration of [&le;]12 months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08). Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed as being low for all but two trials. A funnel plot showed asymmetry, suggesting that small trials showing non-protective effects of vitamin D may have been omitted from the meta-analysis. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation was safe and reduced risk of ARI, despite evidence of significant heterogeneity across trials. The overall effect size may have been over-estimated due to publication bias. Protection was associated with administration of daily doses of 400-1000 IU vitamin D for up to 12 months. The relevance of these findings to COVID-19 is not known and requires investigation.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Jolliffe","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Camargo Jr.","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"John Sluyter","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Mary Aglipay","author_inst":"St Michael's Hospital, Toronto"},{"author_name":"John Aloia","author_inst":"Winthrop University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter Bergman","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Camilla Damsgaard","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Gal Dubnov-Raz","author_inst":"Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Susanna Esposito","author_inst":"University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Davaasambuu Ganmaa","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Clare Gilham","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adit Ginde","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Cameron Grant","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Chris Griffiths","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Hibbs","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wim Janssens","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Anuradha Vaman Khadilkar","author_inst":"Hirabai Cowasji Jehangir Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ilkka Laaksi","author_inst":"University of Tampere"},{"author_name":"Margaret T Lee","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mark Loeb","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Jonathon Maguire","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"David T Mauger","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Pawel Majak","author_inst":"University of Lodz"},{"author_name":"Semira Manaseki-Holland","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"David Murdoch","author_inst":"University of Otago"},{"author_name":"Akio Nakashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachel E Neale","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Christine Rake","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Judith Rees","author_inst":"Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth"},{"author_name":"Jenni Rosendahl","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Robert Scragg","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Shah","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Shimizu","author_inst":"FANCL Corporation, Yokohama"},{"author_name":"Steve Simpson-Yap","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Geeta Trilok Kumar","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitsuyoshi Urashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adrian R Martineau","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

SARS-CoV-2 plasma RNA was detected in 27% of hospitalized participants and 13% of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Amongst the participants hospitalized with COVID-19, higher prevalence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load was associated with worse respiratory disease severity, lower absolute lymphocyte counts, and increased markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially plasma viremia, were associated with increased risk of mortality.

This study aims to evaluate public's perceived importance of the NPIs imposed for COVID-19 control in personal and public health protection in Greece. Methods: This cross-sectional online study, enrolled 657 adult participants from the general Greek population in order to assess their beliefs and evaluate possible factors that influence their perceptions as regards NPI importance in personal and public health protection. Results: Overall, Greeks considered NPIs important for health protection. The participants who were less likely to consider NPIs important were men (OR versus females=1.64, 95% CI:1.15 to 2.36, p=0.007), people younger than 40 years old (OR between ages over 40 versus ages below 40=0.48, 95% CI:0.34 to 0.68, p<0.001), and people who did not chose the Hellenic National Public Health Organization (EODY) to get informed about COVID-19 (OR of EODY versus other sources of information = 0.65, 95% CI:0.46-0.92, p= 0.014). Conclusions: This study profiled Greek people who do and do not consider NPIs important, mainly as of their demographic features.

We aimed to assess whether the newly created models reproduce the full spectrum of humans COVID-19. Methods: We searched the Medline, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research published in English from January 1, to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND, animal models, hamsters, nonhuman primates, macaques, rodent, mice, rats, ferrets, rabbits, cats, and dogs. Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal models of COVID-19. Findings: 13 peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met inclusion criteria. The animals used were nonhuman primates (n=13), mice (n=7), ferrets (n =4), hamsters (n= 4), and cats (n =1). All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology and full recovery. Older animals displayed relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in Rhesus macaques, hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled cytokine storm or coagulopathy. Conclusions: Most of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild pattern of human COVID-19 with full recovery phenotype. No severe illness associated with mortality was observed, suggesting a wide gap between COVID-19 in humans and animal models.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Salleh N Ehaideb","author_inst":"Experimental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center\/King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdulaziz Med"},{"author_name":"Mashan L Abdullah","author_inst":"Experimental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center\/King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdulaziz Med"},{"author_name":"Bisher Abuyassin","author_inst":"Experimental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center\/King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdulaziz Med"},{"author_name":"Abderrezak Bouchama","author_inst":"King Abdullah International Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Nikolovienis","author_inst":"University of West Attica"},{"author_name":"Despina Kardara","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Chrissoula C.

In the absence of effective treatments or a vaccine, peace of mind will come only with community-based SARS-CoV-2 screening, where many people are tested on a regular basis. However, recent models show that short sample-to-answer turnaround time will be a critical property of effective screening strategies (Larremore et al., 2020). Here, we describe an RT-LAMP test for SARS-CoV-2 in raw saliva that takes about 45 minutes from sample to answer and requires only simple equipment (pipettes and a heating source). The assay has a limit of detection of 100 virions per microliter, and targets two separate regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. By combining rapid sample-to-answer turnaround time with the use of saliva, our RT-LAMP assay provides a low-complexity, portable, and robust system for real-time community screening.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas R.

These diseases include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. With the current (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, it is critical to delineate appropriate contextual respiratory protection for HCWs. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) as part of respiratory protection versus another device (egN95\/FFP2) on HCW infection rates and contamination. Methods Our primary outcomes included HCW infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Ebola or MERS when utilizing PAPR. We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently screened all citations, full-text articles, and abstracted data. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Where applicable, we constructed Evidence Profile (EP) tables for each individual outcome. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each outcome was classified according to the GRADE system. Results We identified 689 studies during literature searches. We included 10 full text studies. A narrative synthesis was provided. Two on-field studies reported no difference in the rates of healthcare workers performing airway procedures during care of critical patients with SARS-CoV-2. A single simulation trial reported a lower level of cross-contamination of participants using PAPR compared to alternative respiratory protection. There is moderate quality evidence that PAPR use is associated with greater heat tolerance but lower scores for mobility and communication ability. We identified a trend toward greater self-reported wearer comfort with PAPR technology in low quality observational simulation studies. Conclusion Field observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment. Greater heat tolerance accompanied by lower scores of mobility and audibility in PAPR were identified . Further pragmatic studies are needed in order to delineate actual effectiveness and provider satisfaction with PAPR technology. Please note: Protocol for this review was prospectively registered with the International Register of Systematic Reviews identification number CRD42020184724.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Licina","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Silvers","author_inst":"Monash Health"},{"author_name":"Rhonda Stuart","author_inst":"Monash Health"},{"author_name":"Camille L.

Detailed hospital-level information on patient characteristics, outcomes and capacity strain are currently scarce but would guide clinical decision-making and inform prioritisation and planning. Methods We aimed to determine factors associated with hospital mortality and describe hospital and ICU strain by conducting a prospective cohort study at a tertiary academic centre in London, UK. We included adult patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and followed them up until hospital discharge or 30 days. Baseline factors that are associated with hospital mortality were identified via semi-parametric and parametric survival analyses. Results Our study included 429 patients; 18% of them were admitted to ICU, 52% met criteria for ICU outreach team activation and 61% had treatment limitations placed during their admission. Hospital mortality was 26% and ICU mortality was 34%. Hospital mortality was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, history of chronic kidney disease, increasing baseline C-reactive protein level and dyspnoea at presentation. COVID-19 resulted in substantial ICU and hospital strain, with up to 9 daily ICU admissions and 41 daily hospital admissions, to a peak census of 80 infected patients admitted in ICU and 250 in the hospital. Management of such a surge required extensive reorganisation of critical care services with expansion of ICU capacity from 69 to 129 beds, redeployment of staff from other hospital areas and coordinated hospital-level effort. Conclusions COVID-19 is associated with a high burden of mortality for patients treated on the ward and the ICU and required substantial reconfiguration of critical care services. This has significant implications for planning and resource utilization.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Savvas Vlachos","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Adrian Wong","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Victoria Metaxa","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sergio Canestrini","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Carmen Lopez Soto","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jimstan Periselneris","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kai Lee","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tanya Patrick","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Christopher Stovin","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Katrina Abernethy","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Budoor Albudoor","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rishi Banerjee","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fatimah Juma","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sara Al-Hashimi","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ritesh Maharaj","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gillespie","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rida Chishti","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Yijia Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Jilg","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Dusan Hanidziar","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rebecca M Baron","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Baden","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Athe M Tsibris","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Katrina A Armstrong","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Kuritzkes","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Bruce D Walker","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Howard"},{"author_name":"Xu Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"- Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Shah","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Shimizu","author_inst":"FANCL Corporation, Yokohama"},{"author_name":"Steve Simpson-Yap","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Geeta Trilok Kumar","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitsuyoshi Urashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adrian R Martineau","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Both cough and sneeze based droplets or aerosols encapsulated COVID-19 particles are responsible for air borne transmission of this virus and caused unexpected escalation and high mortality worldwide. Current study intends to investigate correlation of COVID-19 epidemic with meteorological parameters particularly, temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed along with population size. Data set of COVID-19 for highly infected cities of Pakistan was collected from the official website of National Institute of health (NIH). Spearman rank (rs) correlation coefficient test employed for data analysis revealed significant correlation between temperature minimum (TM), temperature average (TA), wind speed (WS) and population size (PS) with COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to analyze the sensitivity of TA, WS, and PS on transmission rate of COVID-19 in selected cities of Pakistan. The results obtained for sensitivity and specificity analysis for all selected parameters signifies sensitivity and direct correlation of COVID-19 transmission with temperature variation, WS and PS. Positive correlation and strong association of PS parameter with COVID-19 pandemic suggested need of more strict actions and control measures for highly populated cities. These findings will be helpful for health regulatory authorities and policymakers to take specific measures to combat COVID-19 epidemic in Pakistan.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Iram Shahzadi","author_inst":"College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54000, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Anum Shahzadi","author_inst":"College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54000, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Junaid Haider","author_inst":"Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sadia Naz","author_inst":"Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tianjin 300308, China"},{"author_name":"Rai M Aamir","author_inst":"Institute of Food and Nutritional Sciences, PMAS-Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi, 46300, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ali Haider","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, 54000, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Hafiz Rizwan Sharif","author_inst":"University Institute of Diet and Nutritional Sciences, The University of Lahore, Gujrat campus, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Imran Mahmood Khan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, 214122, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ikram","author_inst":"Government College University Lahore"},{"author_name":"Katrina Abernethy","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Budoor Albudoor","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rishi Banerjee","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fatimah Juma","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sara Al-Hashimi","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ritesh Maharaj","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gillespie","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rida Chishti","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Yijia Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Jilg","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Dusan Hanidziar","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rebecca M Baron","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Baden","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Athe M Tsibris","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Katrina A Armstrong","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Kuritzkes","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Bruce D Walker","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Howard"},{"author_name":"Xu Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"- Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Shah","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Shimizu","author_inst":"FANCL Corporation, Yokohama"},{"author_name":"Steve Simpson-Yap","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Geeta Trilok Kumar","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitsuyoshi Urashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adrian R Martineau","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

METHODS Chest CT scans and X-Ray images collected from different centers and institutions were downloaded and combined together. Images were separated by patient and 66% of the patients were used to develop and train AI image-based classifiers. Then, the AI automated classifiers were evaluated on a separate set of patients (the remaining 33% patients). RESULTS (Chest X-Ray) Five different data sources were combined for a total of N=9,841 patients (1,733 with covid-19, 810 with bacterial tuberculosis and 7,298 healthy patients). The test sample size was N=3,528 patients. The best AI method reached an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for covid-19 detection of 99%, with a detection rate of 96.4% at 1.0% false positive rate. RESULTS (Chest CT scans) Two different data sources were combined for a total of N=363 patients (191 having covid-19 and 172 healthy patients). The test sample size was N=121 patients. The best AI method reached an AUC for covid-19 detection of 90.9%, with a detection rate of 90.6% at 24.6% false positive rate. CONCLUSIONS Computer aided automatic covid-19 detection from chest X-ray images showed promising results to be used as screening tool during the covid-19 outbreak. The developed method may help to manage patients better in case access to PCR testing is not possible or to detect patients with symptoms missed in a first round of PCR testing. The method will be made available online (www.quantuscovid19.org). These results merit further evaluation collecting more images. We hope this study will allow us to start such collaborations.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xavier P Burgos-Artizzu","author_inst":"Transmural Biotech"},{"author_name":"Anum Shahzadi","author_inst":"College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54000, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Junaid Haider","author_inst":"Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sadia Naz","author_inst":"Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tianjin 300308, China"},{"author_name":"Rai M Aamir","author_inst":"Institute of Food and Nutritional Sciences, PMAS-Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi, 46300, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ali Haider","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, 54000, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Hafiz Rizwan Sharif","author_inst":"University Institute of Diet and Nutritional Sciences, The University of Lahore, Gujrat campus, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Imran Mahmood Khan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, 214122, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ikram","author_inst":"Government College University Lahore"},{"author_name":"Katrina Abernethy","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Budoor Albudoor","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rishi Banerjee","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fatimah Juma","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sara Al-Hashimi","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ritesh Maharaj","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gillespie","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rida Chishti","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Yijia Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Jilg","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Dusan Hanidziar","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rebecca M Baron","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Baden","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Athe M Tsibris","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Katrina A Armstrong","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Kuritzkes","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Bruce D Walker","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Howard"},{"author_name":"Xu Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"- Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Shah","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Shimizu","author_inst":"FANCL Corporation, Yokohama"},{"author_name":"Steve Simpson-Yap","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Geeta Trilok Kumar","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitsuyoshi Urashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adrian R Martineau","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses specific to the Spike (S), in the monomeric and native trimeric forms, and\/or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were equally sensitive in the acute infection phase. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection and substantially underestimated the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the groups of patient positive contacts, i.e. 10.9 to 32.2% reduction and in the random selected general population, i.e. up to 45% reduction. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N IgG antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Craig Fenwick","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antony Croxatto","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alix T.

Conventional wisdom suggests that the continent will bear a higher burden of COVID-19 for the same reasons it suffers high burdens of other infectious diseases: ecology, socio-economic conditions, lack of water and sanitation infrastructure, and weak health systems. However, so far SSA has reported lower incidence and fatalities compared to the predictions of standard models and the experience of other regions of the world. There are three leading explanations, each with very different implications for the final epidemic burden: (1) low case detection, (2) differences in COVID-19 epidemiology (e.g. low R0), and (3) policy interventions. The low number of cases to date have led some SSA governments to relax these policy interventions. Will this result in a resurgence of cases? To understand how to interpret the lower-than-expected COVID-19 case data in Madagascar, we use a simple age-structured model to explore each of these explanations and predict the epidemic impact associated with them. We show that the current incidence of COVID-19 cases can be explained by any combination of the late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and low case detection rates. This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other countries in SSA, remains at risk of an impending health crisis. If NPIs remain enforced, up to 50,000 lives may be saved. Even with NPIs, without vaccines and new therapies, COVID-19 could infect up to 30% of the population, making it the largest public health threat in Madagascar until early 2021, hence the importance of conducting clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle V Evans","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Andres V Garchitorena","author_inst":"Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement"},{"author_name":"Rado JL Rakotonanahary","author_inst":"Pivot"},{"author_name":"John M Drake","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Andriamihaja","author_inst":"Pivot"},{"author_name":"Elinambinina Rajaonarifara","author_inst":"Universite de Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, France"},{"author_name":"Calistus N Ngonghala","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Benjamin ROCHE","author_inst":"IRD"},{"author_name":"Matthew H Bonds","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Julio Rakotonirina","author_inst":"University of Antananarivo"},{"author_name":"Berend Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Semira Gonseth Nussle","author_inst":"University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Murielle Bochud","author_inst":"University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Valerie D'Acremont Genton","author_inst":"University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Gilbert Greub","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Pantaleo","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rida Chishti","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Yijia Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Jilg","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Dusan Hanidziar","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rebecca M Baron","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Baden","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Athe M Tsibris","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Katrina A Armstrong","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Kuritzkes","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Bruce D Walker","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Howard"},{"author_name":"Xu Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"- Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Shah","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Shimizu","author_inst":"FANCL Corporation, Yokohama"},{"author_name":"Steve Simpson-Yap","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Geeta Trilok Kumar","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitsuyoshi Urashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adrian R Martineau","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Preparedness of institutions during epidemic outbreak has a pivotal role in saving lives and preventing further spread. At the same time, these pandemics impact badly on professional and personal life of Health care workers. The objective of this study is to find the opinion of Health care workers regarding their level of preparedness, concerns and perceived impact related to this pandemic outbreak. Materials and Methods: in this study, random samples of doctors and nurses was provided with a self-administered questionnaire regarding their preparedness, work and non-work related concerns and impact on their lives during Covid-19 outbreak. Results: Most of the Health Care Workers believed that their institute preparation to fight Covid-19 pandemic is better than prior to onset of this crisis (p<0.001). Work related stress was seen more commonly in nurses whereas higher frequency of non-work related stress was observed among doctors. Nurses (75.55%) faith in their employer was more than doctors faith (46.66%) regarding their medical needs. There was more acceptance of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic drug for Covid-19 in doctors compared to nurses (p <0.01). Conclusions: Though this institute was more prepared at the time of pandemic spread, substantial opportunity of improvement remains. The consistency of work and non work related anxiety and stress in health care workers is very high in present study group. Concerns and risks of Health Care Workers should be addressed ethically and adequately by strengthening safety measures and building trust in the system they work.

Hospital-based care for COVID-19 is particularly often needed among older adults. However, a key barrier to accessing hospital care in SSA is travel time. To inform the geographic targeting of additional healthcare resources, this study aimed to determine the estimated travel time at a 1km x 1km resolution to the nearest hospital and to the nearest healthcare facility of any type for adults aged 60 years and older in SSA. Methods: We assembled a unique dataset on healthcare facilities' geolocation, separately for hospitals and any type of healthcare facility (including primary care facilities) and including both private- and public-sector facilities, using data from the OpenStreetMap project and the KEMRI Wellcome Trust Programme. Population data at a 1km x 1km resolution was obtained from WorldPop. We estimated travel time to the nearest healthcare facility for each 1km x 1km raster using a cost-distance algorithm. Findings: 9.6% (95% CI: 5.2% - 16.9%) of adults aged 60 and older years had an estimated travel time to the nearest hospital of longer than six hours, varying from 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0% - 3.7%) in Burundi and The Gambia, to 40.9% (95% CI: 31.8% - 50.7%) in Sudan. 11.2% (95% CI: 6.4% - 18.9%) of adults aged 60 years and older had an estimated travel time to the nearest healthcare facility of any type (whether primary or secondary\/tertiary care) of longer than three hours, with a range of 0.1% (95% CI: 0.0% - 3.8%) in Burundi to 55.5% (95% CI: 52.8% - 64.9%) in Sudan. Most countries in SSA contained populated areas in which adults aged 60 years and older had a travel time to the nearest hospital of more than 12 hours and to the nearest healthcare facility of any type of more than six hours. The median travel time to the nearest hospital for the fifth of adults aged 60 and older years with the longest travel times was 348 minutes (IQR: 240 - 576 minutes) for the entire SSA population, ranging from 41 minutes (IQR: 34 - 54 minutes) in Burundi to 1,655 minutes (IQR: 1065 - 2440 minutes) in Gabon. Interpretation: Our high-resolution maps of estimated travel times to both hospitals and healthcare facilities of any type can be used by policymakers and non-governmental organizations to help target additional healthcare resources, such as new make-shift hospitals or transport programs to existing healthcare facilities, to older adults with the least physical access to care. In addition, this analysis shows precisely where population groups are located that are particularly likely to under-report COVID-19 symptoms because of low physical access to healthcare facilities. Beyond the COVID-19 response, this study can inform countries' efforts to improve care for conditions that are common among older adults, such as chronic non-communicable diseases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pascal Geldsetzer","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care and Population Health, Department of Medicine, Stanford University; Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Marcel Reinmuth","author_inst":"Institute of Geography, Heidelberg University; HeiGIT at Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Paul O Ouma","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Sven Lautenbach","author_inst":"HeiGIT at Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Emelda A Okiro","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Wellcome Trust Research Programme; Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Dep"},{"author_name":"Till Baernighausen","author_inst":"Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Heidelberg University; Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.

Methods: An online structured survey was used to collect regular unit-level data regarding the modification to a wide range of vascular services and treatment pathways on a global scale. Results: The survey commenced on 23rd March 2020 worldwide. Over six weeks, 249 vascular units took part in 53 countries (465 individual responses). Overall, 65% of units stopped carotid surgery for anyone except patients with crescendo symptoms or offered surgery on a case-by-case basis, 25% only intervened for symptomatic aortic aneurysms cancelling all elective repairs. For patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease 60% of units moved to an endovascular-first strategy. For patients who had previously undergone endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, 31.8% of units stopped all postoperative surveillance. Of those units regularly engaging in multidisciplinary team meetings, 59.5% of units stopped regular meetings and 39.1% had not replaced them. Further, 20% of units did not have formal personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines in place and 25% reported insufficient PPE availability.

Self-management options, particularly for chronic pain, is required which can be undertaken at ones own convenience and without leaving home. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of tele-yoga therapy on patients suffering with chronic pain reducing pain intensity, disability, anxiety and depression. Material and methods: In total 18 patients with different chronic pain diagnosis were recruited to individual yoga Therapy sessions twice a week at home (tele-yoga) using a videoconference app. Each participant followed set of practices every day at home. Main outcome measures included pain intensity, pain disability, anxiety and depression scores. Data were collected at baseline and after 6-weeks of intervention. Results: There were significant improvement in pain intensity from Baseline to 6-weeks (P<0.001); also pain disability (P<0,001). Both scores of anxiety and depression reduced at the end of intervention period (P<0,001; P<0,001). Conclusions: Pilot results suggest that tele-yoga therapy may be an effective tool to self-manage chronic pain and related functional and psychological impacts. Further larger studies, randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm the preliminary outcome.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neha Sharma","author_inst":"1Aarogyam (UK) CIC 143 Loughborough Road, Leicester, UK; LE4 5LR"},{"author_name":"Dipa Modi","author_inst":"East Park Medical Centre, 41-43 Doncaster Road, Leicester, LE4 6JL"},{"author_name":"Asha Nathwani","author_inst":"Aarogyam (UK) CIC 143 Loughborough Road, Leicester, UK; LE4 5LR"},{"author_name":"Bhavna Pandya","author_inst":"Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Lower Lane, Liverpool, Merseyside, L9 7AL"},{"author_name":"Jaydeep Joshi","author_inst":"1Aarogyam (UK) CIC 143 Loughborough Road, Leicester, UK; LE4 5LR"},{"author_name":"Till Baernighausen","author_inst":"Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Heidelberg University; Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.

Efforts to deliver these essential services in many global settings have been complicated by the emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the pandemic of COVID-19. Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the availability of TB diagnostic and treatment services is critical for identifying policies that can mitigate disruptions of these essential services. China has a dual burden of TB and COVID-19. We conducted a survey and collected data from 13 provinces in China to evaluate the early impact of COVID-19 on TB services and to document interventions that were adopted to maintain the continuity services for TB patients during the pandemic. We use these data to identify additional opportunities that will improve the ability of TB programs to maintain essential services during this crisis. While health systems and underlying epidemiology differ between countries, we believe that sharing China's experience can inform the design of locally tailored strategies to maintain essential TB services during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Shen","author_inst":"Division of TB and HIV\/AIDS Prevention, Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Sha","author_inst":"Department of Tuberculosis, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Chongguang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Qichao Pan","author_inst":"Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ted Cohen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Shiming Chen","author_inst":"China Anti-tuberculosis Association, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Qingshan Cai","author_inst":"Division of Tuberculosis, Zhejiang Provincial Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohong Kan","author_inst":"Department of Scientific Research and Education, Anhui Chest Hospital, Hefei, Anhui Province, China"},{"author_name":"Peilan Zong","author_inst":"Division of Tuberculosis, Jiangxi Chest Hospital, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China"},{"author_name":"Zhong Zeng","author_inst":"Division of Tuberculosis, The Fifth People's Hospital, Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, China"},{"author_name":"Shouyong Tan","author_inst":"Department of Tuberculosis, Guangzhou Chest Hospital.

In this meta-analysis we investigate this association and determine SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals odds of having a specific blood group compared to controls. We performed a systematic search on MEDLINE and LitCovid databases for studies published through July 12, 2020. 7 studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, including a total of 13 subgroups of populations (7524 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and 2962160 controls). We analysed the odds of having each blood group among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients compared with controls. Random-effects models were used to obtain the overall pooled odds ratio (OR). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed in order to explore the source of heterogeneity and results consistency. The results of our meta-analysis indicate that SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals are more likely to have blood group A (pooled OR 1.21; 95%CI: 1.08-1.37) and less likely to have blood group O (pooled OR 0.76, 95%CI: 0.66-0.87).
