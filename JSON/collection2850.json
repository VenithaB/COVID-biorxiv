There is a clear need to establish a gold standard diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans using respiratory tract specimens. METHODS: Searches will be conducted in the bibliographic databases Medline, Embase, bioRxiv, medRxiv, F1000, ChemRxiv, PeerJ Preprints, Preprints.org, Beilstein Archive, and Research Square. Relevant government documents and grey literature will be sought on the FDA's Emergency Use Authorizations website, the ECDC's website, and the website of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics. Finally, papers categorized as diagnosis papers by the EPPI Centre's COVID-19 living systematic map will be added to our screening process; those papers are tagged with the diagnosis topic based on human review, rather than database searches, and thus this set of papers might include ones that have not been captured by our search strategy.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam J Moore","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Maura I Nakahata","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Chaney C Kalinich","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Kate Nyhan","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA | Harvey Cushing \/ John Hay Whitney Medical Libra"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Bromberg","author_inst":"Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA | Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Shi","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne L Wyllie","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20143180","rel_title":"Safe contact tracing for COVID-19: A method without privacy breach using functional encryption techniques based-on spatio-temporal trajectory data","rel_date":"2020-07-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20143180","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread all over the globe. In the absence of a vaccine, a small number of countries have managed to control the diffusion of viruses by early detection and early quarantine. South Korea, one of the countries which have kept the epidemics well-controlled, has opened the infected patients' trajectory to the public. Such a reaction has been regarded as an effective method, however, serious privacy breach cases have been issued in South Korea. Furthermore, some suspected contacts have refused to take infection tests because they are afraid of being exposed. To solve this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving contact tracing method based on spatio-temporal trajectory which can be practically used in many quarantine systems.

Values greater than one correspond to increasing rates of infection, and values less than one indicate that control measures are being effective. Here, we summarise how changes in the behaviour of individuals alter the value of R. We also use matrix models that correctly recreate distributions of times that individuals spend incubating the disease and being infective to demonstrate the accuracy of a simple approximation to estimate R directly from time series of case numbers, hospital admissions or deaths. The largest uncertainty is that the generation time of the infection is not precisely known, but this challenge also affects most of the more complex methods of calculating R. We use this approximation to examine changes in R in response to the introduction of lockdown restrictions in England. This suggests that there was a substantial reduction in R before large scale compulsory restrictions on economic and social activity were imposed on 23rd March 2020. From mid-April to mid-June decline of the epidemic at national and regional level has been relatively slow, despite these restrictions (R values clustered around 0.81). However, these estimates of R are consistent with the relatively high average numbers of close contacts reported by confirmed cases combined with directly measured attack rates via close interactions. This implies that a significant portion of transmission is occurring in workplaces; overcrowded housing or through close contacts that are not currently lawful, routes on which nationwide lockdown will have limited impact.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alastair Grant","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Hyubjin Lee","author_inst":"Korea University"},{"author_name":"Yon Dohn Chung","author_inst":"Korea University"},{"author_name":"Kate Nyhan","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA | Harvey Cushing \/ John Hay Whitney Medical Libra"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Bromberg","author_inst":"Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA | Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Shi","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne L Wyllie","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144592","rel_title":"Genetic risk factors for death with SARS-CoV-2 from the UK Biobank","rel_date":"2020-07-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144592","rel_abs":"We present here genetic risk factors for survivability from infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).

We have nonetheless discovered 5 novel risk variants in 4 genes, discovered by examining 193 deaths from 1,412 confirmed infections in a group of 5,871 UK Biobank participants tested for the virus. We also examine the distribution of these genetic variants across broad ethnic groups and compare it to data from the UK Office of National Statistics for increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2. We confidently identify the gene ERAP2 with a high-risk variant, as well as three other genes of potential interest. Although mostly rare, a common theme of genetic risk factors affecting survival might be the inability to launch or modulate an effective immune and stress response to infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chang Lu","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Rihab Gam","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Arun Prasad Pandurangan","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Julian Gough","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Bromberg","author_inst":"Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA | Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Shi","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne L Wyllie","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20145045","rel_title":"Prediction of COVID-19 Active and Total Cases After a Fall and Rise of Cases","rel_date":"2020-07-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20145045","rel_abs":"During the progress of the COVID-19, many countries have observed that their active cases tend to rise again after falling for some time.

These estimates are subject to both quantifiable and nonquantifiable sources of uncertainty, and sustain known margins of error of a factor about 2.5. However, because uncertainties in key parameters affect both risk estimates the same way, they leave the relative risk ratio for fill all seats compared to middle seat open close to 1.8 (i.e., close to 1\/4,300)\/(1\/7,700). We estimate the mortality risks caused by Covid-19 infections contracted on airplanes, taking into account that infected passengers can in turn infect others. The point estimates, which use 2019 data about the percentage of seats actually occupied on US flights, range from one death per 400,000 passengers to one death per 600,000.

The virus responsible for this disease is called SARS-CoV-2. It affects its victims respiratory system and causes severe lung inflammation, making it harder for them to breathe. The virus is airborne, and so has a high infection rate. Originated in China last December, the virus has spread across seven continents, affecting the population of over 210 countries, making it one of the fiercest pandemics ever recorded. Despite multiple independent and collaborative attempts to develop a vaccine or a cure, an effective solution is yet to come out. While the disease has put the world in a standstill, detecting the positive subjects and isolating them from the others as soon as possible is the only way to minimize its spread. However, many countries are currently experiencing a massive shortage of diagnostic equipment and medical personals. This insufficiency inspired us to work on a computer-based automatic method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, we proposed a sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to detect COVID-19 through analyzing Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. The model is capable of identifying the disease with almost 92.5% accuracy. We believe the implementation of this model will help the physicians and pathologists all over the world to single out the victims quickly and thus reduce the prevalence of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdullah Al Jaid Jim","author_inst":"Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Rafi","author_inst":"Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

If SARS-CoV-2 also spreads via aerosols, this has implications for measures taken to limit transmission. Objectives The aim of this study is to assess exposure to airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles from breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing in an indoor environment. Methods An exposure assessment model was developed to estimate numbers of SARS-CoV-2 particles in aerosol droplets, expelled during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing by an infected person in an unventilated indoor environment, and subsequent inhalation by one or more persons. Scenarios encompass a range of virus concentrations, room sizes and exposure times. Results The calculated total volume of expelled aerosol droplets was highest for a sneeze, followed by a cough and speaking for 20 minutes, and lastly breathing for 20 minutes. A few to as much as tens of millions of virus particles were expelled. Exposure probability strongly depends on the viral concentration in mucus, as well as on the scenario. Exposure probabilities were generally below 1% at a virus concentration in mucus below 10^5 per mL for all scenarios, increasing steeply at different higher concentrations. According to nose \/ throat swab data collected from patients, 75%, 50% and 5% of infected individuals carry an estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 per mL mucus of at least 10^5, 10^6 and 10^8, respectively. Discussion Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols generated during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing in an unventilated indoor environment is possible. This study forms a basis to estimate probabilities of exposure to SARS-Cov-2 by airborne transmission in indoor spaces. As long as it is uncertain what fraction of the airborne virus particles is infectious and as long as a dose response relation is lacking, it is recommended to be precautious.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack F.

However, microbial composition of the respiratory tract and other infected tissues, as well as their possible pathogenic contributions to varying degrees of disease severity in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. Method Between January 27 and February 26, 2020, serial clinical specimens (sputum, nasal and throat swab, anal swab and feces) were collected from a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 8 mildly and 15 severely ill patients (requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation), in the Guangdong province, China. Total RNA was extracted and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed in combination with laboratory diagnostic assays. Co-infection rates, the prevalence and abundance of microbial communities in these COVID-19 patients were determined. Findings Notably, respiratory microbial co-infections were exclusively found in 84.6% of severely ill patients (11\/13), among which viral and bacterial co-infections were detected by sequencing in 30.8% (4\/13) and 69.2% (9\/13) of the patients, respectively. In addition, for 23.1% (3\/13) of the patients, bacterial co-infections with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were also confirmed by bacterial culture. Further, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes in one severely ill patient was demonstrated, which might be the primary cause of his disease deterioration and death one month after ICU admission. Interpretation Our findings identified distinct patterns of co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and various respiratory pathogenic microbes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity.

Here we study how its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has diversified genetically since its first emergence in December 2019. We have created a pipeline combining both phylogenetic and structural analysis to identify possible human-adaptation related mutations in a data set consisting of 4,894 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences. Although the phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is low, the whole genome phylogenetic tree can be divided into five clusters\/clades based on the tree topology and clustering of specific mutations, but its branches exhibit low genetic distance and bootstrap support values. We also identified 11 residues that are high-frequency substitutions, with four of them currently showing some signal for potential positive selection. These fast-evolving sites are in the non-structural proteins nsp2, nsp5 (3CL-protease), nsp6, nsp12 (polymerase) and nsp13 (helicase), in accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF8) and in the structural proteins N and S. Temporal and spatial analysis of these potentially adaptive mutations revealed that the incidence of some of these sites was declining after having reached an (often local) peak, whereas the frequency of other sites is continually increasing and now exhibit a worldwide distribution. Structural analysis revealed that the mutations are located on the surface of the proteins that modulate biochemical properties. We speculate that this improves binding to cellular proteins and hence represents fine-tuning of adaptation to human cells. Our study has implications for the design of biochemical and clinical experiments to assess whether important properties of SARS-CoV-2 have changed during the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China."},{"author_name":"xiaofeng zhai","author_inst":"Nanjing Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Jiyong Zhou","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Animal Virology of Ministry of Agriculture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"James R Thompson","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Huahui Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Weiqun He","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Zhaoyong Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Airu Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Fangming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Tianzhu Liang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Bei Zhong","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan People's Hospital, Qingyuan, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shicong Ruan","author_inst":"Yangjiang People's Hospital, Yangjiang, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Mian Gan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Karsten Kristiansen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Hein M Tun","author_inst":"HKU-Pasteur Research Pole, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China."},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yi-min Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Junhua LI","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20146035","rel_title":"Age Matters: COVID-19 Prevalence in a Vaping Adolescent Population -

Our study aims to investigate the relationship of vaping with the prevalence of COVID-19 infection across the United States and in the District of Columbia. Methods: COVID-19 case counts by state and the District of Columbia were obtained via the Worldometers website on 04\/30\/2020. Prevalence of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents were calculated using estimated 2019 population data from the US Census Department. Age ranges analyzed were: high school age children, Ages 18-24, Ages 25-44, and Ages 45-65. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to determine if the rate of vaping was correlated with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population. Findings: The Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated that persons vaping between 18 years and 24 years of age had a correlation coefficient of 0.278 with prevalence of COVID-19 infection (p=0.048). Vaping high school students had a correlation coefficient of 0.153 with prevalence of COVID-19 (p=0.328). Persons vaping in the age group 25-45 years had a correlation coefficient of 0.101 in association to COVID-19 prevalence (p=0.478). And finally, persons vaping between the age 45-65 years old had a correlation coefficient 0.130 with respect to COVID-19 prevalence (p=0.364). Interpretation: Increased COVID-19 prevalence is associated with vaping in the adolescent population between ages 18 and 24. Further prospective studies need to be performed in order investigate the severity of outcomes of vaping in association with COVID-19 infection.

Identifying and isolating infected individuals at an early phase of the disease has been a very successful approach to stop the chain of transmission. But this approach faces a practical challenge of limited resources. Sample pooling solves this enigma by significantly improving the testing capacity and result turn around time while using no extra resources. However, the general sample pooling method also has the scope of significant improvements. This article describes a process to further optimize the resources with optimal sample pooling.

Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages, and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. Aim: To analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years. Study Design and Setting: We used anonymised Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and administrative data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. Methods: We calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. Results: Survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1.72 (1.55, 1.90) compared to 2016. Compared to the general population in 2016-2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2.15 (2.11,2.20) in 2016-2019 to 2.94 (2.81,3.08) in 2020. Conclusions: The survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of death in the 2020 study periods.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joe Hollinghurst","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Jane Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Richard Fry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Ashley Akbari","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Mike Gravenor","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Alan Watkins","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Fiona Verity","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Kulkarni","author_inst":"Southern Illinois University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Robinson","author_inst":"SIU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fangming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Tianzhu Liang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Bei Zhong","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan People's Hospital, Qingyuan, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shicong Ruan","author_inst":"Yangjiang People's Hospital, Yangjiang, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Mian Gan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Karsten Kristiansen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Hein M Tun","author_inst":"HKU-Pasteur Research Pole, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China."},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yi-min Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Junhua LI","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.184846","rel_title":"The potential role of miR-21-3p in coronavirus-host interplay","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.184846","rel_abs":"ABSTRACTHost miRNAs are known as important regulators of virus replication and pathogenesis. They can interact with various viruses by several possible mechanisms including direct binding the viral RNA. Identification of human miRNAs involved in coronavirus-host interplay is becoming important due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this work we performed computational prediction of high-confidence direct interactions between miRNAs and seven human coronavirus RNAs. In order to uncover the entire miRNA-virus interplay we further analyzed lungs miRNome of SARS-CoV infected mice using publicly available miRNA sequencing data. We found that miRNA miR-21-3p has the largest probability of binding the human coronavirus RNAs and being dramatically up-regulated in mouse lungs during infection induced by SARS-CoV. Further bioinformatic analysis of binding sites revealed high conservativity of miR-21-3p binding regions within RNAs of human coronaviruses and their strains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stepan Nersisyan","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Narek Engibaryan","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Gorbonos","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Ksenia Kirdey","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Alexey Makhonin","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Alexander Tonevitsky","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Fiona Verity","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Kulkarni","author_inst":"Southern Illinois University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Robinson","author_inst":"SIU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fangming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Tianzhu Liang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Bei Zhong","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan People's Hospital, Qingyuan, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shicong Ruan","author_inst":"Yangjiang People's Hospital, Yangjiang, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Mian Gan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Karsten Kristiansen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Hein M Tun","author_inst":"HKU-Pasteur Research Pole, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China."},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yi-min Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Junhua LI","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.04.187989","rel_title":"A pH-dependent switch mediates conformational masking of SARS-CoV-2 spike","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.04.187989","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike employs mobile receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to engage the ACE2 receptor and to facilitate virus entry.

Nonetheless, D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts a critical interprotomer contact and that this dramatically shifts the S protein trimer conformation toward an ACE2-binding and fusion-competent state. Consistent with the more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated. These results indicate that D614G adopts conformations that make virion membrane fusion with the target cell membrane more probable but that D614G retains susceptibility to therapies that disrupt interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with the ACE2 receptor.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonid Yurkovetskiy","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Xue Wang","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kristen E Pascal","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Christopher Tompkins-Tinch","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Nyalile","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Yetao Wang","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"William E Diehl","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ann Dauphin","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Claudia Carbone","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

The rapid increase in chilblain\/pernio-like cases during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely SARS-CoV-2-associated. The relationship between skin symptom onset and COVID-19 PCR\/antibody test timing, however, remains uncharacterized. We established an international registry for cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.2, 3 Providers reported time between dermatologic symptom onset and positive\/negative COVID-19 laboratory results, when available. From 8 April-30 June, 2020, 906 laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases with dermatologic manifestations were reported, 534 of which were chilblains\/pernio.3 Among PCR-tested patients, 57%(n=208) overall and 15%(n=23) of chilblains\/pernio cases were PCR-positive. Antibody positivity was 37%(n=39) overall and 19%(n=15) for chilblains\/pernio. We evaluated 163 patients with timing information on PCR and\/or antibody testing (Table 1). For patients with suspected COVID-19 and any cutaneous manifestation, PCR-positive testing occurred median 6 (IQR 1-14) days after dermatologic symptoms started while PCR-negative testing occurred median 14 (IQR 7-24) days later. For patients with pernio\/chilblains, PCR-positivity was noted 8 (IQR 5-14) days after symptoms and negativity median 14 (IQR 7-28) days later. Antibody testing (IgM or IgG) was positive median 30 (IQR 19-39) days after symptom onset for all dermatologic manifestations and 27 (IQR 24-33) days after chilblains\/pernio onset. Like Hubiche et al, our data highlight the low frequency of SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ testing in COVID-19 patients with cutaneous manifestations. Positive predictive values for COVID-19 PCR are influenced by viral shedding kinetics, which are difficult to assess in non-respiratory presentations.4 Our data reveal that early PCR testing is more likely to be positive than later testing, even when date-of-onset is defined by cutaneous manifestations rather than systemic symptoms. Most COVID-19 antibody data are from systemically-ill patients; the kinetics of antibody production in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infections remain unclear.5 Here, positive antibodies resulted median 30 days from disease onset, beyond the frequently used 14-21 day testing window. In outpatients with true infection, many factors influence the likelihood of a positive antibody result: antibody production, test availability, assay sensitivity, and timing of care-seeking in relation to symptom-onset. These variables influence our interpretation of individual test results and our understanding of the association between pernio and COVID-19. More population-level testing data is necessary to optimize diagnostic test timing. Positive identification of COVID-19 in minimally-symptomatic patients, including patients with skin findings, is critical to the public health effort.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Esther E Freeman","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Devon E McMahon","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Lindy P Fox","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Marlys S Fassett","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Thomas Nyalile","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Yetao Wang","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"William E Diehl","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ann Dauphin","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Claudia Carbone","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

During the COVID-19 pandemic some countries have reduced access to supplemental oxygen (e.g. oxygen rationing), whereas other nations have maintained and even improved access to supplemental oxygen. We examined whether such variation in the access to supplemental oxygen had any bearing on mortality in COVID-19. Methods Three independent investigators searched for, identified and extracted the nationally recommended target oxygen levels for the commencement of oxygen in COVID-19 pneumonia from the 29 worst affected countries. Mortality estimates were calculated from three independent sources. We then applied linear regression analysis to examine for potential association between national targets for the commencement of oxygen and case fatality rates. Results Of the 26 nations included, 15 had employed conservative oxygen strategies to manage COVID-19 pneumonia. Of them, Belgium, France, USA, Canada, China, Germany, Mexico, Spain, Sweden and the UK guidelines advised commencing oxygen when oxygen saturations (SpO2) fell to 91% or less. Target SpO2 ranged from 92% to 95% in the other 16 nations. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between the national target for the commencement of oxygen and national case fatality rates (Spearmans Rho = -0.622, p < 0.001). Conclusion Our study highlights the disparity in oxygen provision for COVID-19 patients between the nations analysed, and indicates such disparity in access to supplemental oxygen may represent a modifiable factor associated with mortality during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- The Gibraltar COVID-19 Research Group: Health Systems","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Daniel Goyal","author_inst":"University of Gibraltar, Medicine and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lindy P Fox","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Marlys S Fassett","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Thomas Nyalile","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Yetao Wang","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"William E Diehl","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ann Dauphin","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Claudia Carbone","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Here, we demonstrate a five-parameter sub-epidemic wave modeling framework that provides a simple characterization of unfolding trajectories of COVID-19 epidemics that are progressing across the world at different spatial scales. We calibrate the model to daily reported COVID-19 incidence data to generate six sequential weekly forecasts for five European countries and five hotspot states within the United States. The sub-epidemic approach captures the rise to an initial peak followed by a wide range of post-peak behavior, ranging from a typical decline to a steady incidence level to repeated small waves for sub-epidemic outbreaks. We show that the sub-epidemic model outperforms a three-parameter Richards model, in terms of calibration and forecasting performance, and yields excellent short- and intermediate-term forecasts that are not attainable with other single-peak transmission models of similar complexity. Overall, this approach predicts that a relaxation of social distancing measures would result in continuing sub-epidemics and ongoing endemic transmission. We illustrate how this view of the epidemic could help data scientists and policymakers better understand and predict the underlying transmission dynamics of COVID-19, as early detection of potential sub-epidemics can inform model-based decisions for tighter distancing controls.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Rothenberg","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Kimberlyn Roosa","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Amna Tariq","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"James M Hyman","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Ruiyan Luo","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"William E Diehl","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ann Dauphin","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Claudia Carbone","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Parents worry about the virus (86.4%) vs. CYP (69.4%), whilst (89%) parents are vigilant for symptoms of the virus vs. CYP(69.4%). A thematic analysis of the qualitative comments covered 34 subthemes, forming eight-overarching themes: Virus 1)risk of infection, 2)information, guidance and advice, 3)change in health care provision, and 4)fears and anxieties; Lockdown and isolation 5)psychological and social impact, 6)keeping safe under lockdown, 7)provisions and dependence on others, 8)employment and income. Conclusions Parents and CYP were worried about the virus, although CYP less so. Parents and children however, were frustrated with the lack of specific and paediatric focused information and guidance, expressing disappointment with the adult centric information available. Parents also felt alone, especially with their concerns around the implications of cardiac service suspension and the implication for their childs health. In order to better support children and their families, resources need to be developed to address families and CYP concerns for their health during this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luise Marino","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Wagland","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Culliford","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Tara Bharucha","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sam Sodergren","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Darlington","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"William E Diehl","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ann Dauphin","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Claudia Carbone","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

The survey found severely stressed doctors to be younger (<45years), of female gender working in the ICU setting and insecure regarding their finances. Concern regarding PPE shortages and ethical dilemmas of rationing care are factors inducing severe stress amongst doctors working in ICU settings. This is the first such survey done in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic from the Indian sub-continent. The findings have important implications on the International healthcare community, especially across Africa, Asia & South America where the contagion continues to wreak havoc.

Methods and Findings A retrospective research design was used to compare the clinical characteristics of tinnitus between patients from March to April 2020 under pandemic pressure and those from the matching period in 2019. Tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire and the minimum masking level (MML) measure while anxiety was quantified using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). The assessments were repeated after a 2-month interval, in which sound therapy was applied to a subgroup of patients. In all, 94 and 70 cases were reported in the 2020 and 2019 groups, respectively. The effects of the pandemic on emotional status were evident from a higher incidence of anxiety and much higher SAS scores in the 2020 group. There was also an increase in the THI scores in the 2020 group, but the between-year difference was smaller than that of the SAS score. Moreover, there was no between-year difference in MML or the treatment effect, as measured via both THI and MML. Furthermore, the reduction in SAS score in the second assessment was significantly smaller in the 2020 group. However, a positive correlation between the initial SAS score and the improvement was seen within the 2020 group. Conclusions Anxiety increased greatly in tinnitus subjects due to the COVID 19 pandemic. However, this was not associated with an increase in tinnitus severity in 2020. Instead, there was no between-year difference in the THI score or MML or in the improvement of either measure after treatment. The smaller improvement in SAS score and the positive correlation with the initial SAS score in the 2020 group suggests that the SAS score change in this group might largely be due to the natural relief of pressure as the pandemic decelerated in China. Therefore, the anxiety change induced by the COVID 19 pandemic is not likely to have a strong impact on tinnitus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Li Xia","author_inst":"Sichuan Provincial People Hospital and Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"School of Communication Science and Disorders, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 4R2, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dong Chuan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Sichuan Provincial People Hospital and Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610072, China"},{"author_name":"Jiangang Fan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Sichuan Provincial People Hospital and Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610072, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengnong Chen","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People Hospital, 200233, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Naresh Shanmugam","author_inst":"Dr.Rela Institute & Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Akila Rajakumar","author_inst":"Dr.Rela Institute & Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Mettu Srinivas Reddy","author_inst":"Dr.Rela Institute & Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Ilankumaran Kaliamoorthy","author_inst":"Dr.Rela Institute & Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Rela","author_inst":"Dr.Rela Institute & Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Besides the SIRD model does not include some aspects of COVID-19, as the symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups of individuals and the incubation period, for example, in this work we intend to use a classical and easy to handle model to introduce a thorough method of adjustment that allows us to achieve reliable fitting for the real data and to obtain insights about the current trends for the pandemic in each locality. Our results demonstrate that for localities for which the ERN is about 2, only rigid measures are efficient to avoid overwhelming the health care system. These findings corroborate the relevance of keeping the value of the ERN below 1 and applying containment measures early.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael Marques Da Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Paran\u00e1"},{"author_name":"Oleg Dukhin","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Ivan Molodtsov","author_inst":"Clinical City Hospital named after I.V.

The inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection in children remains poorly characterised. Methods We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 127 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 1 month to 16 years from Wuhan and Jingzhou of Hubei Province. Patients presented between January 25th and March 24th 2020. Information on clinical features, laboratory results, plasma cytokines\/chemokines and lymphocyte subsets were analysed. Findings Children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (67.7%) and the median age was 7.3 [IQR 4.9] years. All but one patient with severe disease was aged under 2 and the majority (5\/7) had significant co-morbidities. Despite 53% having viral pneumonia on CT scanning only 2 patients had low lymphocyte counts and no differences were observed in the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha; and interferon (IFN)-gamma; between patients with mild, moderate or severe disease. Interpretations We demonstrated that the immune responses of children to COVID-19 infection is significantly different from that seen in adults. Our evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger a robust inflammatory response or \"cytokine storm\" in children with COVID-19, and this may underlie the generally better outcomes seen in children with this disease. These data also imply anti-cytokine therapies may not be effective in children with moderate COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guoqing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weihua Hu","author_inst":"First Hospital of Jingzhou"},{"author_name":"Ian Hall","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jiang Yue","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hongyun Lu","author_inst":"Zhuhai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liemin Ruan","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maoqing Ye","author_inst":"East China Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Mei","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Xu","author_inst":"NorthShore University HealthSystem"},{"author_name":"Alexey Mazus","author_inst":"Moscow City Center for AIDS Prevention and Control, Moscow Department of Healthcare, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Ilia Spiridonov","author_inst":"Center for Theoretical Problems of Physico-Chemical Pharmacology RAS, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Fazly Ataullakhanov","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA"},{"author_name":"Leonid Margolis","author_inst":"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA"},{"author_name":"Alexander Shpektor","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Elena Vasilieva","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Objectives: We explored the SARS-CoV-2 genomic load as a risk factor for adverse patient outcomes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study among adult patients admitted to the hospital between March 31st to April 10th, 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. We segregated patients into 3 genomic load groups: low (Cycle threshold (Ct) [&ge;]35), intermediate (25 < Ct < 35), and high (Ct [&le;] 25) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Measurements: A composite outcome of death, intubation, and\/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used. Secondary outcomes included the severity of pneumonia on admission, as measured by the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Main Results: Of 457 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from March 31st to April 10th, 2020, 316 met inclusion criteria. Included patients were followed for a median of 25 days (IQR 21-28). High genomic load at presentation was associated with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (p=0.005), transplant recipient status (p<0.001), and duration of illness less than 7 days (p=0.005). Importantly, patients with high genomic load were more likely to reach the primary endpoint (p=0.001), and had higher PSI scores on admission (p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, a high genomic load remained an independent predictor of the primary outcome. Results remained significant in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a high genomic load of SARS-CoV-2 at the time of admission is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes, that above and beyond age, comorbidity, and severity of illness on presentation, may be used to risk-stratify patients, and call for a quantitative diagnostic assay to become available.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioannis M Zacharioudakis","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Prithiv J Prasad","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fainareti N Zervou","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Atreyee Basu","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Inglima","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott A Weisenberg","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria E Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liemin Ruan","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maoqing Ye","author_inst":"East China Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Mei","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Xu","author_inst":"NorthShore University HealthSystem"},{"author_name":"Alexey Mazus","author_inst":"Moscow City Center for AIDS Prevention and Control, Moscow Department of Healthcare, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Ilia Spiridonov","author_inst":"Center for Theoretical Problems of Physico-Chemical Pharmacology RAS, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Fazly Ataullakhanov","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA"},{"author_name":"Leonid Margolis","author_inst":"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA"},{"author_name":"Alexander Shpektor","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Elena Vasilieva","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.
