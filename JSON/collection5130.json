As assay details and primer sequences become widely known, many laboratories could perform diagnostic tests using methods such as RT-PCR or isothermal RT-LAMP amplification. A key advantage of RT-LAMP based approaches compared to RT-PCR is that RT-LAMP is known to be robust in detecting targets from unprocessed samples. In addition, RT-LAMP assays are performed at a constant temperature enabling speed, simplicity, and point-of-use testing. Here, we provide the details of an RT-LAMP isothermal assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus with performance comparable to currently approved tests using RT-PCR. We characterize the assay by introducing swabs in virus spiked synthetic nasal fluids, moving the swab to viral transport medium (VTM), and using a volume of that VTM for performing the amplification without an RNA extraction kit. The assay has a Limit-of-Detection (LOD) of 50 RNA copies\/L in the VTM solution within 20 minutes, and LOD of 5000 RNA copies\/L in the nasal solution. Additionally, we show the utility of this assay for real-time point-of-use testing by demonstrating detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in less than 40 minutes using an additively manufactured cartridge and a smartphone-based reader. Finally, we explore the speed and cost advantages by comparing the required resources and workflows with RT-PCR. This work could accelerate the development and availability of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics by proving alternatives to conventional laboratory benchtop tests.\n\nSignificance StatementAn important limitation of the current assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 stem from their reliance on time- and labor-intensive and laboratory-based protocols for viral isolation, lysis, and removal of inhibiting materials. While RT-PCR remains the gold standard for performing clinical diagnostics to amplify the RNA sequences, there is an urgent need for alternative portable platforms that can provide rapid and accurate diagnosis, potentially at the point-of-use. Here, we present the details of an isothermal amplification-based detection of SARS-CoV-2, including the demonstration of a smartphone-based point-of-care device that can be used at the point of sample collection.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anurup Ganguli","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign"},{"author_name":"Ariana Mostafa","author_inst":"University of Illinois at urbana champaign"},{"author_name":"Jacob Berger","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Aydin","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign"},{"author_name":"Fu Sun","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign"},{"author_name":"Enrique Valera","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Brian T.

Currently, there is no vaccine available for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 also uses its receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the spike (S) protein to engage the host receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), facilitating subsequent viral entry. Here we report the immunogenicity and vaccine potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (SARS2-RBD)-based recombinant proteins. Immunization with SARS2-RBD recombinant proteins potently induced a multi-functional antibody response in mice. The resulting antisera could efficiently block the interaction between SARS2-RBD and ACE2, inhibit S-mediated cell-cell fusion, and neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the anti-RBD sera also exhibited cross binding, ACE2-blockade, and neutralization effects towards SARS-CoV. More importantly, we found that the anti-RBD sera did not promote antibody-dependent enhancement of either SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry or authentic virus infection of Fc receptor-bearing cells. These findings provide a solid foundation for developing RBD-based subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV2.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinkai Zang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Chenjian Gu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Bingjie Zhou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Chao Zhang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yong Yang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Shiqi Xu","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Xueyang Zhang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Lulu Bai","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiping Sun","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hong Tang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillette","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhong Huang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.107870","rel_title":"Unfractionated heparin potently inhibits the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to a human cell line","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.107870","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known to bind to the receptor, ACE2, on the surface of target cells. The spike protein is processed by membrane proteases, including TMPRSS2, and either internalises or fuses directly with the cell, leading to infection. We have identified a human cell line that expresses both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the RT4 urinary bladder transitional carcinoma, and used it to develop a proxy assay for viral interactions with host cells. A tagged recombinant form of the spike protein, containing both the S1 and S2 domains, interacted strongly with RT4 cells as determined by flow cytometry, whereas the S1 domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) interacted weakly. S1S2 interaction was temperature dependent and increased sharply at 37{degrees}C, suggesting that processing of the intact spike protein is likely to be important in the interaction. S1S2 protein could associate with cells with a low dependence on ACE2 expression, while RBD required the presence of ACE2 for interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we used a flow cytometric assay to determine the effect of heparin on spike protein interaction with RT4 cells. Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein interaction with an IC50 value of <0.05U\/ml whereas two low molecular weight heparins were much less effective. A mutant form of the spike protein, lacking the Arg-rich region proposed to be a furin cleavage site, interacted very weakly with cells and had a lower affinity for unfractionated and lower molecular weight heparin than the wild type spike protein. This indicates that the furin cleavage site might also be a heparin binding site and potentially important in interactions with host cells. Taken together, our data suggest that heparin, particularly unfractionated forms, could be considered to reduce clinical manifestations of COVID-19 by inhibiting continuing viral infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySince the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, the world has faced a vast public health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 associates with human cells through interaction of the viral spike protein with the host receptor, ACE2. In the absence of a vaccine, new treatments are required to reduce the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a novel technique to demonstrate spike protein interactions with human cells with low levels of ACE2 at the cell surface, suggesting a secondary receptor. We demonstrate the importance of a new heparin-binding site within the viral spike protein for these interactions. We also found that unfractionated heparin was able to bind to the viral spike protein and therefore, potently inhibit viral spike protein interactions with human cells. Our data demonstrate that ACE2 is not absolutely required for spike protein interactions with human cells and furthermore, that unfractionated heparin should be considered as a treatment to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lynda J Partridge","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Lucy Urwin","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Martin JH Nicklin","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"David C James","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Luke R Green","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Peter N Monk","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Xueyang Zhang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Lulu Bai","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiping Sun","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hong Tang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillette","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhong Huang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.108605","rel_title":"Mechanistic insights into ventricular arrhythmogenesis of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.108605","rel_abs":"Background: Recent reports on the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone, or combined with azithromycin (AZM) in the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have raised cardiac safety concerns. Currently, there is limited mechanistic data evaluating cardiac safety with HCQ and AZM therapy. \nMethods: Using comprehensive In Vitro ProArrhythmia Assay (CiPA) Schema IC50 paradigms, we examined the cardiac electrophysiological effects of HCQ and HCQ\/AZM. Molecular modelling explored HCQ and AZM binding properties to hERG. Langendorff-perfused guinea-pig hearts were electrically and optically mapped by multi-electrode array and voltage (RH237) and Ca2+ (Rhod-2 AM) dyes. Human action potential and ion current reconstructions were performed in silico.\nResults: HCQ blocked IKr and IK1 with IC50 concentrations (10+-0.6 and 34+-5.0 microM) within the therapeutic range observed clinically. HCQ also blocked INa and ICaL but at higher IC50, whilst Ito and IKs were unaffected. Contrastingly, AZM produced minor inhibition of INa, ICaL, IKs, and IKr,, with no effect on IK1 and Ito.  HCQ + AZM combined inhibited IKr and IK1 with IC50s of 7.7 +- 0.8 microM and 30.4 +- 3.0 microM, but spared INa, ICaL and Ito,.  Molecular modelling confirmed potential HCQ binding to hERG. Cardiac mapping and ECG studies in isolated hearts demonstrated that HCQ slowed heart rate and ventricular conduction with associated prolongation of PR, QRS and QT intervals. Optical mapping demonstrated, and prolonged, more heterogeneous, action potential durations and intracellular Ca2+ transients. These effects were accentuated with combined HCQ+AZM treatment, which elicited electrical alternans, re-entrant circuits and wave breaks. Reconstruction in a human in-silico model demonstrated that this is attributable to the integrated action of HCQ and AZM reducing IKr, IKs and IK1.\nConclusions: These data provide an electrophysiological basis for recent FDA guidelines cautioning against combined HCQ\/AZM administration for the treatment of Covid-19 on the grounds of potential cardiac safety. We would strongly recommend monitoring of electrocardiographic QT interval with the use of this combination of medications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gongxin Wang","author_inst":"Henan SCOPE  Research Institute of Electrophysiology Co.

An attractive coronavirus drug target is the main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro) because of its vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors which bind and block the active site of the main protease, but little has been done to address potential non-competitive inhibition which targets regions beyond the active site, partly because the fundamental biophysics of such allosteric control is still poorly understood. In this work, we construct an Elastic Network Model (ENM) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro homodimer protein and analyse the dynamics and thermodynamics of the main proteases ENM. We found a rich and heterogeneous dynamical structure in the correlated motions, including allosterically correlated motions between the homodimeric proteases active sites. Exhaustive 1-point and 2-point mutation scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies confirm previously experimentally identified bioactive residues, but also suggest several new candidate regions that are distant from the active site for control of the protease function. Our results suggest new dynamically-driven control regions as possible candidates for non-competitive inhibiting binding sites in the protease, which may assist the development of current fragmentbased binding screens. The results also provide new insight into the protein physics of fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Igors Dubanevics","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Tom C McLeish","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Yeol Kyo Choi","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Taeyong Park","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Maham Tanveer","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Cao","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Nathan R.

We consider here diffusive processes through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 as such alternative route. We found a subdiffusive regime that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a significant rate.

Data about COVID-19 infection in cancer patients are scarce, and they point out a higher risk of complications due to the viral infection in this population. Moreover, cancer treatments could increase viral complications, specially those treatments based on the use of immunotherapy with checkpoints antibodies. There are no clinical data about the safety of immune check point antibodies in cancer patients when they become infected by SARS-CoV-2. As checkpoint inhibitors, mainly anti PD-1 and anti CTLA-4 antibodies, are an effective treatment for most melanoma patients, avoiding their use during the pandemic could lead to a decrease in the chances of curing melanoma. Methods: In Spain we have started a national registry of melanoma patients infected by SARS-Cov-2 since April 1st, 2020. A retrospective analysis of patients included in the Spanish registery has been performed weekly since the activation of the study. Interim analysis shows unexpected findings about cancer treatment safety in SARS-Cov-2 infected melanoma patients, so a rapid communication to the scientific community is mandatory Results: Fifty patients have been included as of May 17th, 2020. Median age is 69 years (range 6 to 94 years), 27 (54%) patients are males and 36 (70%) patients have stage IV melanoma. Twenty-two (44%) patients were on active anticancer treatment with anti PD-1 antibodies, 16 (32%) patients were on treatment with BRAF plus MEK inhibitors and 12 (24%) patients were not on active cancer treatment. COVID-19 episode has been resolved in 43 cases, including 30 (70%) patients cured, four (9%) patients that have died due to melanoma progression, and nine (21%) patients that have died from COVID-19. Mortality rates from COVID-19 according to melanoma treatment type were 16%, 15% and 36% for patients on immunotherapy, targeted drugs, and for those that were not undergoing active cancer treatment, respectively.

The containment measures for this disease such as the requirement of health care facilities greatly rely on estimating the future dynamics and flattening of the COVID-19 curve. However, it is always challenging to estimate the future trends and flattening of the COVID-19 curve due to the involvement of many real-life variables. Recently, traditional methods based on SIR and SEIR have been presented for predictive monitoring and detection of flattening of the COVID-19 curve. In this paper, a novel method for detection of flattening of the COVID-19 curve and its ending life-cycle using only the time-series of new cases per day is presented. Simulation results are compared to the SIR based methods in three different scenarios using COVID-19 curves for South Korea, the United States of America, and India. In this study, simulations, performed on the 26th April 2020 show that the peak of the COVID-19 curve in the USA has already arrived and situated on the 14th of April 2020, while the peak of the COVID-19 curve for India has yet to arrive.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dr. Praveen Gupta","author_inst":"Government Polytechnic College, Jaipur"},{"author_name":"Prof.  K.K.

But using that objective ignores that some of these interventions, like bans of public events or lockdowns, must be transitory and as short as possible because of their significative economic and societal costs. Here we derive a simple and mathematically rigorous criterion for designing optimal transitory non-pharmaceutical interventions. We find that reducing the reproduction number below one is sufficient but not necessary. Instead, our criterion prescribes the required reduction in the reproduction number according to the maximum health services' capacity. To explore the implications of our theoretical results, we study the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in 16 cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we estimate the minimal reduction of the contact rate in each city that is necessary to control the epidemic optimally. We also compare the optimal start of the intervention with the start of the actual interventions applied in each city. Our results contribute to establishing a rigorous methodology to guide the design of non- pharmaceutical intervention policies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco Tulio Angulo","author_inst":"CONACyT - Institute of Mathematics, UNAM."},{"author_name":"Fernando Casta\u00f1os","author_inst":"Department of Automatic Control, CINVESTAV-IPN"},{"author_name":"Jorge X.

This work aims to correlate the effect of temperature with that of Total Cases, Recovery, Death, and Critical cases all around the globe. All the data were collected in April and the maximum and minimum temperature and the average temperature were collected from January to April (i.e the months during which the disease was spread). Regression was conducted to find a non-linear relationship between Temperate and the cases. It was evident that indeed temperature does have a significant effect on the total cases and recovery rate around the globe. It was also evident from the study that the countries with lower temperatures are the hotspots for COVID-19. The Study depicted a non-linear dose-response between temperature and the transmission, indicating the existence of the best temperature for its transmission.

As COVID-19 mortality occurs mainly in elderly and as Africa has a comparably young population, the death rates should be lower than on other continents. We calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMR) using age-specific case fatality rates for COVID-19 and the age structure of the population of Africa and of other continents. Compared to a European or Northern American population, the standardised mortality ratio was only 0.22 and 0.25, respectively, corresponding to reduction of deaths rates to a quarter. Compared to the Asian and Latin American & Caribbean population, the SMR was 0.43 and 0.44, respectively, corresponding to half the death rate for Africa. It is useful to quantify the isolated effect of the African age-structure on potential COVID-19 mortality for illustrative and communication purposes, keeping in mind the importance of public health measures that have been shown to be effective in reducing cases and deaths. The different aspect of age pyramids of a European and an African population are striking and the potential implications for the pandemic are often discussed but rarely quantified.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabrice Mougeni","author_inst":"Centre de Recherches Medicales de Lambarene (CERMEL), Gabon"},{"author_name":"Ance Mangaboula","author_inst":"Centre de Recherches Medicales de Lambarene (CERMEL), Gabon"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Lell","author_inst":"CERMEL and Department of Medicine I, Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Jaime A.

We propose three contributions: a) ICUBAM (ICU Bed Availability Monitor), a tool which both collects and visualizes information on CCB availability entered directly by intensivists. b) An analysis of CCB availability and ICU admissions and outcomes using collected by \\ICUBAM during a 6-week period in the hard-hit Grand Est region of France, and c) Explanatory and predictive models adapted to CCB availability prediction, and fitted to availability information collected by ICUBAM. Methods: We interact directly with intensivists twice a day, by sending a SMS with a web link to the ICUBAM form where they enter 8 numbers: number of free and occupied CCBs (ventilator-equipped) for both COVID-19 positive and COVID-19- negative patients, the number of COVID-19 related ICU deaths and discharges, the number of ICU refusals, and the number of patients transferred to another region due to bed shortages. The collected data are described using univariate and multivariate methods such as correspondence analysis and then modeled at different scales: a medium and long term prediction using SEIR models, and a short term statistical model to predict the number of CCBs. Results: ICUBAM was brought online March 25, and is currently being used in the Grand-Est region by 109 intensivists representing 40 ICUs (95% of ICUs). ICUBAM allows for the calculation of CCB availability, admission and discharge statistics. Our analysis of data describes the evolution and extent of the COVID-19 health crisis in the Grand-Est region: on April 6th, at maximum bed capacity, 1056 ventilator-equipped CCBs were present, representing 211% of the nominal regional capacity of 501 beds. From March 19th to March 31st, average daily COVID-19 ICU inflow was 68 patients\/day, and 314 critical care patients were transferred out of the Grand-Est region. With French lockdown starting on March 17th, a decrease of the daily inflow was found starting on April 1st: 23 patients\/day during the first fortnight of April, and 7 patients\/day during the last fortnight. However, treatment time for COVID-19 occupied CCBs is long: 15 days after the peak on March 31st, only 20% of ICU beds have been freed (50% after 1 month). Region-wide COVID-19 related in-ICU mortality is evaluated at 31%. Models trained from ICUBAM data are able to describe and predict the evolution of bed usage for the Grand-Estregion. Conclusion: We observe strong uptake of the ICUBAM tool, amongst both physicians and local healthcare stakeholders (health agencies, first responders etc.). We are able to leverage data collected with ICUBAM to better understand the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Grand Est region.

This work proposes a scheme to monitor the temporal evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic using the time series of its total number of confirmed cases in a given region. The monitored parameter is the spread rate obtained from this time series (day-1) expressed in %\/day. The scheme's capability is verified using the epidemic data from China and South Korea. Its projection capability is shown for Italy and United States with scenarios for the ensuing 30 days from April 2nd, 2020. The spread rate (relative rate of change of the time series) is very sensitive to sudden changes in the epidemic evolution and can be used to monitor in real-time the effectiveness of containment actions. The logarithm of this variable allows identifying clear trends of the evolution of the COVID-10 epidemic in these countries. The spread rate calculated from the number of confirmed cases of infection is interpreted as a probability per unit of time of virus infection and containment actions. Its product with the number of confirmed cases of infections yields the number of new cases per day. The stabilization and control of the epidemic for China and South Korea appear to occur for values of this parameter below 0.77 %\/day (doubling time of 90 days).","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joao Manoel Losada Moreira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do ABC"},{"author_name":"julie josse","author_inst":"Polytechnique"},{"author_name":"Philippe Bensaid","author_inst":"Hopital Argenteuil, France"},{"author_name":"Cecile Bost bru","author_inst":"CHU Grenoble, France"},{"author_name":"Edeline Coinde","author_inst":"Hop Ajaccio,France"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Dessioux","author_inst":"Hop Pays du Mont Blanc, France"},{"author_name":"Cecile Fournial","author_inst":"Hop Nantes, France"},{"author_name":"Jean Gashignard","author_inst":"Hop Robert Debre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Herve Haas","author_inst":"Hop Nice, France"},{"author_name":"Veronique Hentgen","author_inst":"Versailles Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Frederic Huet","author_inst":"Dijon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Lara Valles","author_inst":"Hospital General de Villalba, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana Drozdowskyj","author_inst":"Translational Cancer Research Unit, Instituto Oncologico Dr Rosell, Dexeus University  Hospital, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ainara Soria","author_inst":"Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cayetana Maldonado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Morales","author_inst":"Parc Tauli Hospital Universitario,Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Rosell","author_inst":"Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute and Hospital (IGTP), Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mariano Provencio","author_inst":"Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Berrocal","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario General de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20103655","rel_title":"Differential Effects of Intervention Timing on COVID-19 Spread in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20103655","rel_abs":"Assessing the effects of early non-pharmaceutical interventions1-5 on COVID-19 spread in the United States is crucial for understanding and planning future control measures to combat the ongoing pandemic6-10.

We find significant reductions of the basic reproductive numbers in major metropolitan areas in association with social distancing and other control measures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that, had these same control measures been implemented just 1-2 weeks earlier, a substantial number of cases and deaths could have been averted. Specifically, nationwide, 61.6% [95% CI: 54.6%-67.7%] of reported infections and 55.0% [95% CI: 46.1%-62.2%] of reported deaths as of May 3, 2020 could have been avoided if the same control measures had been implemented just one week earlier. We also examine the effects of delays in re-implementing social distancing following a relaxation of control measures. A longer response time results in a stronger rebound of infections and death.

Participants: 498 subjects, 80% women. Participation was offered to all the HCW of Emergencies, Intensive Care and Anesthesia, Internal Medicine and Pneumology. Other units not directly involved in the care of these patients were offered to participate. Intervention: naso and oropharyngeal PCR determination was performed together with IgG and IgM antibody determination by immunochromatography. On the day of sampling, a health questionnaire was answered, reporting symptoms on the same day and in the previous fourteen days. Main outcome measures: percentage of HCW with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, percentage of HCW with positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Two individuals were detected with PCR for SARS-CoV-2 positive (0.4%). Both were asymptomatic on the day of sampling, but one of them had had a CoVID-19 compatible picture in the previous two weeks and had positive IgG and IgM; therefore, only one subject was truly asymptomatic carrier (0.2%). 9 workers with positive IgG (1.8%) were detected. Conclusions: the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among health workers of the services directly involved in the care of patients with CoVID-19 was very low in our center. This type of strategy can be one more tool in controlling the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian Olalla","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Interna.

However, abrogating the inflammatory response in infectious diseases may impair a desired host response and predispose to secondary infections. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of critically ill COVID-19 patients during an 8-week span and compared the prevalence of secondary infection and outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Additionally, we included representative histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at our institution. Results: 111 patients were identified, of which 54 had received tocilizumab while 57 had not. Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (48.1% vs. 28.1%, p=0.029 and fungal (5.6% vs. 0%, p=0.112) infections. Consistent with higher number of infections, patients who received tocilizumab had higher mortality (35.2% vs. 19.3%, p=0.020). Seven cases underwent autopsy. In 3 cases who received tocilizumab, there was evidence of pneumonia on pathology. Of the 4 cases that had not been given tocilizumab, 2 showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and 2 exhibited diffuse alveolar damage. Conclusions: Experimental therapies are currently being applied to COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as anti-IL-6 therapy have the potential to impair viral clearance, predispose to secondary infection, and cause harm. We seek to raise physician awareness of these issues and highlight the need to better understand the immune response in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas M Kimmig","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Wu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Matthew Gold","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Natasha N Pettit","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Pitrak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Mueller","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Aliya N Husain","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Ece A Mutlu","author_inst":"Rush University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan M Mutlu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Veronique Hentgen","author_inst":"Versailles Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Frederic Huet","author_inst":"Dijon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Lara Valles","author_inst":"Hospital General de Villalba, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana Drozdowskyj","author_inst":"Translational Cancer Research Unit, Instituto Oncologico Dr Rosell, Dexeus University  Hospital, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ainara Soria","author_inst":"Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cayetana Maldonado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Morales","author_inst":"Parc Tauli Hospital Universitario,Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Rosell","author_inst":"Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute and Hospital (IGTP), Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mariano Provencio","author_inst":"Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Berrocal","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario General de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20103853","rel_title":"COVID-19 in London, a Case Series Demonstrating Late Improvement in Survivors","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20103853","rel_abs":"Objective To determine whether the trajectories of survivors and non-survivors are different in patients admitted to intensive care in London.

There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19, in Chest X-ray and CT scan, however their availability in this pandemic outbreak might be compromised. At this moment, the role of Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has yet to be explored. OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study is to describe the POCUS findings of the disease in COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). Determining the correlation of these parameters with vital signs, laboratory results and chest X-ray, as well as, therapeutic decisions and prognosis. METHODS: Prospective study carried out in the emergency department (ED) of two academic hospitals. High suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 patients were subjected to the ultrasonographic measurement of the inferior vena cava (IVC), focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS), and Lung Ultrasonography (Lung POCUS). RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, ninety-six patients were enrolled. The mean age was 68.2 years (SD 17.5). The most common finding in Lung POCUS was an irregular pleural line (63.2%) followed by bilateral confluent (55.2%) and isolated B-lines (53.1%), which was associated with a positive RT-PCR (OR 4.729, 95% CI: 1.989-11.246; p<0.001), and correlated with IL-6 levels (rho = 0.622; p = 0.002). The IVC moderately correlated with levels of pO2, expiratory (rho = -0.539; p =0.014) and inspiratory (rho = -0.527; p =0.017), with troponin I (rho = 0.509; p=0.03).

Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with data for the case study island nation of New Zealand (NZ) along with relevant parameters sourced from the NZ and international literature. This included a testing level for symptomatic cases of 7,800 tests per million people per week. Results: It was estimated to take between 27 and 33 days of no new detected cases for there to be a 95% probability of epidemic extinction. This was for effective reproduction numbers (Re) in the range of 0.50 to 1.0, which encompass such controls as case isolation (the shorter durations relate to low Re values). For a 99% probability of epidemic extinction, the equivalent time period was 37 to 44 days. In scenarios with lower levels of symptomatic cases seeking medical attention and lower levels of testing, the time period was up to 53 to 91 days (95% level). Conclusions: In the context of a high level of testing, a period of around one month of no new notified cases of COVID-19 would give 95% certainty that elimination of SARS-CoV-2 transmission had been achieved.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Parry","author_inst":"University of Otago, Dunedin"},{"author_name":"Ayesha J Verrall","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Michael G Baker","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Markus Schwehm","author_inst":"ExploSYS GmbH"},{"author_name":"Martin Eichner","author_inst":"Epimos GmbH"},{"author_name":"Suveer Singh","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Marcela Vizcaychipi","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Lara Valles","author_inst":"Hospital General de Villalba, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana Drozdowskyj","author_inst":"Translational Cancer Research Unit, Instituto Oncologico Dr Rosell, Dexeus University  Hospital, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ainara Soria","author_inst":"Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cayetana Maldonado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Morales","author_inst":"Parc Tauli Hospital Universitario,Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Rosell","author_inst":"Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute and Hospital (IGTP), Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mariano Provencio","author_inst":"Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Berrocal","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario General de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20104117","rel_title":"The role of age distribution, time lag between reporting and death and healthcare system capacity on case fatality estimates of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20104117","rel_abs":"European countries report large differences in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case fatality risk (CFR).

We discuss the impact of these factors on the CFR estimates for Germany, Italy, France, and Spain for the COVID-19 pandemic from early March to mid-April, 2020. We found that, first, a large proportion of the difference in CFRs can be attributed to different age structures of the cases. Second, lags of 5-10 days between day of case report and death should be used, since these provide the most constant estimates. Third, for France, Italy, and Spain, intensive care beds occupied by COVID-19 patients were positively associated with fatality risks of hospitalized cases. Our results highlight that cross-country comparisons of crude CFR estimates can be misleading and should be avoided.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Christian Wiessner","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Anja Holz","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Annika Moehl","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wiegel","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Heiko Becher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Lara Valles","author_inst":"Hospital General de Villalba, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana Drozdowskyj","author_inst":"Translational Cancer Research Unit, Instituto Oncologico Dr Rosell, Dexeus University  Hospital, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ainara Soria","author_inst":"Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cayetana Maldonado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Morales","author_inst":"Parc Tauli Hospital Universitario,Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Rosell","author_inst":"Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute and Hospital (IGTP), Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mariano Provencio","author_inst":"Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Berrocal","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario General de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20104182","rel_title":"COVID-19 Infection Forecasting based on Deep Learning in Iran","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20104182","rel_abs":"Since December 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is outbreak from China and infected more than 4,666,000 people and caused thousands of deaths.

We have constructed a model for the spread of the virus that reproduces this phenomenon via inclusion of two (or more) categories of susceptibility to the virus. In the simplest case, the population is given a smaller fraction of 10-20% with higher susceptibility and the balance of 80-90% with lower susceptibility. Susceptibility is taken to include the level of immunity to the virus combined with the societal circumstances of certain smaller groups within a population. This is programmed numerically by considering a realistic random rate of contacts, together with an assumed constant viral genome. The remaining major variable is the societal response of nations to the outbreak, with earlier or later application of various degrees of lockdown, tracing and sanitation. China, South Korea and other nations, including Germany, have stopped or greatly slowed the spread of the disease before it could run its course through a whole population. Using this model the extent of progress toward herd immunity is discussed, with an in-principle estimate of the remaining toll to be experienced.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malcolm W McGeoch","author_inst":"PLEX Corporation, 275 Martine St., Suite 100, Fall River, MA 02723, USA."},{"author_name":"Julie McGeoch","author_inst":"Dept. of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, 52 Oxford St., Cambridge MA  02138, USA."},{"author_name":"Jafar Tanha","author_inst":"University of Tabriz"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Annika Moehl","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wiegel","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Heiko Becher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Lara Valles","author_inst":"Hospital General de Villalba, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana Drozdowskyj","author_inst":"Translational Cancer Research Unit, Instituto Oncologico Dr Rosell, Dexeus University  Hospital, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ainara Soria","author_inst":"Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cayetana Maldonado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Morales","author_inst":"Parc Tauli Hospital Universitario,Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Rosell","author_inst":"Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute and Hospital (IGTP), Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mariano Provencio","author_inst":"Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Berrocal","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario General de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20103630","rel_title":"Global Analysis of an SEIRS Model for COVID-19 Capturing Saturated Incidence with Treatment Response","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20103630","rel_abs":"Sequel to V.

We consider an SEIRS model capturing saturated incidence with treatment response. In this theoretical model, we assumed that the treatment response is proportional to the number of infected as long as the incidence cases are within the capacity of the healthcare system, after which the value becomes constant, when the number of confirmed cases exceed the carrying capacity of the available medical facilities. Thus, we obtain the reproduction number stating that when R0 is less than a critical value R1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Also, we studied the existence of the local and global stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria and found that the kind of treatment response and inhibitory measures deployed in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic determines whether the disease will die out or become endemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Adeyemi Oluyori","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Ahmadu  Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Helen O.

The first case in India was reported in Kerala on January 30th 2020. To break the chain of spreading, Government announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24th 2020, which is increased two times. The Ongoing lockdown 3.0 is over on May 18th, 2020. We derived how the lockdown relaxation is going to impact on containment of the outbreak. Here the Exponential Growth Model has been used to derive the epidemic curve based on the data collected from February 11th 2020, to May 11th 2020, and the Machine Learning based Linear Regression model that gives the epidemic curve to predict the cases with the continuous flow of the lockdown. We estimate that if the lockdown is continuing with more relaxation, then the estimated infected cases reach up to 1.16 crores by June 30th 2020, and the lockdown would persist with current restriction, then the expected predicted infected cases are 5.69 lacs. The Exponential Growth Model and the Linear Regression Model are advantageous to predict the number of affected cases of COVID-19. These models can be used for forecasting in long term intervals.

It is essential to understand how coronavirus transmits from one person to another and this knowledge will help protect the vulnerable and limit the spread of the Corona virus. The mode of respiratory transmission of Corona virus is not completely understood as of date. Using a computer simulation, this paper analyses the probability of spreading of Corona virus through air among the people who are standing in a queue. The parameters such as the diameter of the virus particle, room temperature, relative humidity, height of the person, distance between the people and the waiting time in the queue are considered in the computer model to determine the distribution of Corona virus and hence identify the risk factor of spreading the Covid-19. This paper describes the possibilities of getting infectious when a Covid-19 infected person present in a queue and the impact on the waiting time and the position in the queue on the transmission of Corona virus.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santhosh Samuel Mathews","author_inst":"Amzetta"},{"author_name":"Satya Narayan Pati","author_inst":"Centurion University"},{"author_name":"Aashirbad Maharana","author_inst":"Centurion University"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Annika Moehl","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wiegel","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Heiko Becher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Lara Valles","author_inst":"Hospital General de Villalba, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana Drozdowskyj","author_inst":"Translational Cancer Research Unit, Instituto Oncologico Dr Rosell, Dexeus University  Hospital, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ainara Soria","author_inst":"Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cayetana Maldonado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Morales","author_inst":"Parc Tauli Hospital Universitario,Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Rosell","author_inst":"Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute and Hospital (IGTP), Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mariano Provencio","author_inst":"Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Berrocal","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario General de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20104315","rel_title":"Modes of transmission of COVID-19 outbreak- a mathematical study","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20104315","rel_abs":"The world has now paid a lot of attention to the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). This virus mainly transmitted between humans through directly respiratory droplets and close contacts. However, there is currently some evidence where it has been claimed that it may be indirectly transmitted. In this work, we study the mode of transmission of COVID-19 epidemic system based on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. We have calculated the basic reproduction number $R_0$ by next-generation matrix method. We observed that if $R_0<1$, then disease-free equilibrium point is locally as well as globally asymptotically stable but when $R_0>1$, the endemic equilibrium point exists and is globally stable. Finally, some numerical simulation is presented to validate our results.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chandan Maji","author_inst":"Vivekananda College, Thakurpukur"},{"author_name":"Satya Narayan Pati","author_inst":"Centurion University"},{"author_name":"Aashirbad Maharana","author_inst":"Centurion University"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Annika Moehl","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wiegel","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Heiko Becher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Lara Valles","author_inst":"Hospital General de Villalba, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana Drozdowskyj","author_inst":"Translational Cancer Research Unit, Instituto Oncologico Dr Rosell, Dexeus University  Hospital, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ainara Soria","author_inst":"Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cayetana Maldonado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Morales","author_inst":"Parc Tauli Hospital Universitario,Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Rosell","author_inst":"Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute and Hospital (IGTP), Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mariano Provencio","author_inst":"Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Berrocal","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario General de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
