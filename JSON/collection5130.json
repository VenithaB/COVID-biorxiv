We evaluated the performance of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 infection compared to RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab alone in patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 324 consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital. All hospitalized patients who had RT-PCR testing and HRCT were included in the study. HRCTs were classified as Category 1, 2 or 3. Patients were then divided into four groups based on HRCT category and RT-PCR swab results for analysis. Results: The average age of patients was 59.4 (+15.2) years and 123 (38.9%) were female. Predominant ethnicity was African American 148 (46.11%). 161 patients tested positive by RT-PCR, while 41 tested positive by HRCT. 167 (52.02%) had category 1 scan, 63 (19.63%) had category 2 scan and 91 (28.35%) had category 3 HRCT scans. There was substantial agreement between our radiologists for HRCT classification ({kappa} = 0.64). Sensitivity and specificity of HRCT classification system was 77.6 and 73.7 respectively. Ferritin, LDH, AST and ALT were higher in Group 1 and D-dimers levels was higher in Group 3; differences however were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Due to its high infectivity and asymptomatic transmission, until a highly sensitive and specific COVID-19 test is developed, HRCT should be incorporated into the assessment of patients who are hospitalized with suspected COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maulin Patel","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junad Chowdhury","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Zheng","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Osheen Abramian","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steven Verga","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqing Zhao","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicole Patlakh","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Fleece","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Montecalvo","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gary Cohen","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maruti Kumaran","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chandra Dass","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20114033","rel_title":"Continuous Electroencephalography (cEEG) Characteristics and Acute Symptomatic Seizures in COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20114033","rel_abs":"Background: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have only recently been described, with a paucity of literature reporting the potential relationship between COVID-19 and acute symptomatic seizures. Two prior studies found no clinical or electrographic seizures in their cohorts of COVID-19 patients with altered mental status (AMS) and clinical seizure-like events (SLEs). Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 22 critically-ill COVID-19 patients above the age of 18 years who underwent EEG (electroencephalography) monitoring between April 20th, 2020 and May 20th, 2020 were studied. 19 patients underwent continuous EEG (cEEG) for at least 24 hours, and 3 patients underwent routine EEGs (<1 hour). Demographics including age, gender, comorbid medical, and neurological conditions were collected. Clinical variables included EEG findings, anti-seizure medications, discharge disposition, and survival. Findings: 17 patients underwent EEG monitoring for unexplained altered mental status changes and 5 patients underwent monitoring for a seizure-like event. 5 patients had epileptiform abnormalities on EEG (4 patients on cEEG, 1 on routine EEG); and only 2 of 5 epileptic EEG patients had a prior history of epilepsy. 2 patients in our cohort had electrographic seizures in the absence of prior epilepsy history. No patients with epileptiform abnormalities or electrographic seizures had acutely abnormal neuroimaging on CT or MRI. Interpretation: Encephalopathic COVID-19 positive patients had a range of EEG abnormalities, and a higher proportion of patients in this series had electrographic seizures than previous literature suggests. This may be influenced by the duration of monitoring with cEEG and the use of a 21 channel electrode system. cEEG findings may help to guide antiseizure medical therapy, as well as the workup of altered mental status in the setting of unremarkable neuroimaging. Funding: No funding was used for this study.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shreya Louis","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew Dhawan","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Christopher Newey","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Dileep Nair","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Lara Jehi","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hantus","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Vineet Punia","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"David Fleece","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Montecalvo","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gary Cohen","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maruti Kumaran","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chandra Dass","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20111542","rel_title":"Ambient air pollutants, meteorological factors and their interactions affect confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 120 Chinese cities","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20111542","rel_abs":"Emerging evidences have confirmed effects of meteorological factors on novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Here, we collected total confirmed cases of COVID-19 by combining with meteorological factors and air pollutants data from 15th January 2020 to 18th March 2020 in 120 Chinese cities. Spearman correlation analysis was employed to estimate the association between two variables; univariate and multivariate negative binomial regression analysis were applied to explore the effect of air pollutants and meteorological parameters on the COVID-19 confirmed cases. Positive associations were found between the confirmed cases of COVID-19 and carbon monoxide (CO), aerodynamic particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter [&le;]2.5 um (PM2.5), relative humidity (RH) and air pressure (AP). And negative association was found for sulfur dioxide (SO2). In addition, multivariate negative binomial regression analysis suggested that confirmed cases of COVID-19 was positively correlated with ozone (O3) in lag 0 day while it was negatively associated with wind velocity (WV) in lag 14 days, and the pollutants-meteorological factors interactions also associate with COVID-19. In conclusions, air pollutants and meteorological factors and their interactions all associate with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianli Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Health and Occupational Medicine, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern"},{"author_name":"Linyuan Qin","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Statistics, School of Public Health, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541001, P.

The authors offer a mathematical framework for ventilator distribution under scarcity conditions using an optimized network model and solver. The framework is interoperable with existing COVID-19 healthcare demand models and scales for different user-defined system sizes, including hospital networks, city, state, regional and national-scale prioritization. The authors' approach improves current capabilities for medical device resource management within the existing incident command system while accounting for availability of devices, ventilation treatment time periods, disinfection and cleaning between patients, as well as shipping logistics time. The authors present a proof of concept using a high fidelity COVID-19 data set from Colorado, discusses how to scale nationally, and emphasizes the importance of applying ethical human-in-the-loop decision making when using this or similar approaches to managing medical device resources during epidemic emergencies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Billingham","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Widrick","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nathan J Edwards","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Sybil Klaus","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Lara Jehi","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hantus","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Vineet Punia","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"David Fleece","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Montecalvo","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gary Cohen","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maruti Kumaran","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chandra Dass","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20113803","rel_title":"A vulnerability index for COVID-19: spatial analysis to inform equitable response in Kenya","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20113803","rel_abs":"Background: Response to the COVID-19 pandemic calls for precision public health reflecting our improved understanding of who is the most vulnerable and their geographical location. We created three vulnerability indices to identify areas and people who require greater support while elucidating health inequities to inform emergency response in Kenya. Methods: Geospatial indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices; social (SVI), epidemiological (EVI) and a composite of the two (SEVI) resolved at 295 sub-counties in Kenya. SVI included nineteen indicators that affect the spread of disease; socio-economic inequities, access to services and population dynamics while EVI comprised five indicators describing comorbidities associated with COVID-19 severe disease progression. The indicators were scaled to a common measurement scale, spatially overlaid via arithmetic mean and equally weighted. The indices were classified into seven classes, 1-2 denoted low-vulnerability and 6-7 high-vulnerability. The population within vulnerabilities classes was quantified. Results: The spatial variation of each index was heterogeneous across Kenya. Forty-nine north-western and partly eastern sub-counties (6.9 m people) were highly vulnerable while 58 sub-counties (9.7 m people) in western and central Kenya were the least vulnerable for SVI. For EVI, 48 sub-counties (7.2 m people) in central and the adjacent areas and 81 sub-counties (13.2 m people) in northern Kenya were the most and least vulnerable respectively. Overall (SEVI), 46 sub-counties (7.0 m people) around central and south-eastern were more vulnerable while 81 sub-counties (14.4 m people) that were least vulnerable. Conclusion: The vulnerability indices created are tools relevant to the county, national government and stakeholders for prioritization and improved planning especially in highly vulnerable sub-counties where cases have not been confirmed. The heterogeneous nature of the vulnerability highlights the need to address social determinants of health disparities, strengthen the health system and establish programmes to cushion against the negative effects of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter M Macharia","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Noel K Joseph","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Emelda A Okiro","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Sybil Klaus","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Lara Jehi","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hantus","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Vineet Punia","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"David Fleece","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Montecalvo","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gary Cohen","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maruti Kumaran","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chandra Dass","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114330","rel_title":"Safety Stock: Predicting demand on the supply chain in Brazilian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114330","rel_abs":"Background: Many challenges lie ahead for COVID-19, not only related to the acceleration of the pandemic, but also to the prediction of the hospital's personal protective equipment to accommodate the explosive demand. Due to the situation of uncertainty, the hospital administration encourages the excess stock of these materials, causing excess products in some hospitals, but shortages in others. Although three main factors limit the number of patients seen at a hospital: the number of beds available, the number of equipment, and, above all, the number of health professionals available at the hospital, per shift. Objective: In this scenario, a challenge is to build an easy-to-use computational tool to predict the demand for personal protective equipment in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, with updating in real-time. Methods: We propose naive statistical modeling, which combines historical data on the consumption of personal protective equipment by hospitals, current protocols for their uses and epidemiological data related to the disease, in order to build predictive models for the demand for personal protective equipment in Brazilian hospitals during the pandemic. We then embed our modeling in a tool that can provide the safety stock for a particular hospital. Results: Our tool presents forecasts of consumption\/demand for personal protective equipment over time, indicating the moment when the hospital reaches maximum consumption, the estimate of how long it will work in this state, and when it will leave it. Conclusion: With our forecasting, a hospital may have estimated, based on its stock levels and possible new purchases, its needs related to a specific personal protective equipment, which allows for the adoption of strategies to control and keep the stock at safety levels to the demand. As a direct consequence, it enables interchange and cooperation between hospitals, aiming to maximize the care during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oilson Alberto Gonzatto Jr.","author_inst":"UFSCar-ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Diego Carvalho do Nascimento","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Cibele Maria Russo","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Marcos Jardel Henriques","author_inst":"UFSCar-ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Caio Paziani Tomazella","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Maristela Oliveira Santos","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Denis Neves","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Diego Assad","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Guerra","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Keise Bertazo","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Jose Alberto Cuminato","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Francisco Louzada","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114017","rel_title":"Modelling the SARS-CoV-2 first epidemic wave in Greece: social contact patterns and impact assessment of social distancing interventions.","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114017","rel_abs":"In Greece, a nationwide lockdown to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was imposed on March 23, 2020. As by the end of April the first epidemic wave is waning, it is important to assess the infection attack rate and quantify the impact of physical distancing. We implemented a survey to assess social mixing patterns before the epidemic and during lockdown. We estimated R0 from surveillance data and assessed its decline as a result of physical distancing based on social contacts data. We applied a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model to estimate the infection attack rate and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). As multiple social distancing measures were implemented simultaneously (schools\/work\/leisure), we assessed their overall impact as well as their relative contribution. R0 was estimated 2.38 (95%CI: 2.01,2.80). By April 26th, the infection attack rate was 0.12% (95% CrI: 0.06%,0.26%) and the IFR 1.12% (95% CrI: 0.55%,2.31%). During lockdown, daily contacts were reduced by 86.9% and the effective reproduction number reached 0.46 (95% CrI: 0.35,0.57). The reduction in R0 attributed to lockdown was 81.0% (95% CrI: 71.8%,86.0%) whereas the reduction attributed to each measure separately ranged between 10%-24%. We assessed scenarios with less disruptive social distancing measures as well as scenarios where measures are partially lifted after lockdown. This is the first impact assessment of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in a European country. It suggests that only multiple measures implemented simultaneously could reduce R0 below 1. Measuring social mixing patterns can be a tool for real-time monitoring of the epidemic potential.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vana Sypsa","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Roussos","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Paraskevis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theodore Lytras","author_inst":"National Public Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Angelos Hatzakis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Denis Neves","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Diego Assad","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Guerra","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Keise Bertazo","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Jose Alberto Cuminato","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Francisco Louzada","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20114124","rel_title":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among children visiting a hospital during the initial Seattle outbreak","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20114124","rel_abs":"Children are strikingly underrepresented in COVID-19 case counts.

To better assess the frequency of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection, we serologically screened 1,775 residual samples from Seattle Children's Hospital collected from 1,076 children seeking medical care during March and April of 2020. Only one child was seropositive in March, but nine were seropositive in April for a period seroprevalence of >1%. Most seropositive children (8\/10) were not suspected of having had COVID-19. The sera of most seropositive children had neutralizing activity, including one that neutralized at a dilution >1:18,000.

The most important result of the model was the identification and segregation of pandemic characteristics into two distinct groups: those that are invariant across countries, and those that are highly variable. Amongst the former is the infective period T_L, which was very similar for all countries, with a mean value E(T_L) = 15.5 +\/- 0.6 days. The other invariants were T_R, the average time between contacts and R = N_C, the average number of contacts while infective with mean values E(T_R) = 3.5 +\/- 0.2 days E(N_C) = E(R) = 4.46+\/- 0.17. In contrast to these invariants, there was a highly variable time lag T_D between the peak in the daily number of infected individuals and the peak in the daily number of deaths, ranging from a low of T_D= 4 days for Italy and Denmark, to a high of T_D= 17 for Norway. The mortality probability among identified cases was also highly variable, ranging from low values 3.5%, 5% and 5% for Norway, Denmark and Germany respectively to high values of 18%, 18% and 20% for France, Sweden and the UK respectively. Our analysis predicts that the number of deaths per million population until the pandemic ends (defined as when the daily number of deaths is less than 5) will be lowest for Norway (45 deaths\/million) and highest for the United Kingdom (628 deaths\/million). Finally, we observe a small but detectable effect of average temperature on the probability  of infection in each contact, with higher temperatures associated with lower infectivity.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gyan Bhanot","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Charles DeLisi","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Yassine Hassouni","author_inst":"ESMaR, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University, Av.

Modern high-throughput sequencing technology has led to the deposition of vast numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in curated repositories, which have been useful in mapping the spread of the virus around the globe. They also provide a unique opportunity to observe virus evolution in real time. Here, we evaluate two cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to identify rapidly emerging variants within structured cis-regulatory elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Overall, twenty variants are present at a minor allele frequency of at least 0.5%. Several enhance the stability of Stem Loop 1 in the 5UTR, including a set of co-occurring variants that extend its length. One appears to modulate the stability of the frameshifting pseudoknot between ORF1a and ORF1b, and another perturbs a bi-stable molecular switch in the 3UTR. Finally, five variants destabilize structured elements within the 3UTR hypervariable region, including the S2M stem loop, raising questions as to the functional relevance of these structures in viral replication. Two of the most abundant variants appear to be caused by RNA editing, suggesting host-viral defense contributes to SARS-CoV-2 genome heterogeneity. This analysis has implications for the development of therapeutics that target viral cis-regulatory RNA structures or sequences, as rapidly emerging variations in these regions could lead to drug resistance.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean P.

A total of 305 whole genome sequences from 19 Indian states were downloaded from GISAID. Sequences were aligned using the ancestral Wuhan-Hu genome sequence (NC_045512.2). A total of 633 variants resulting in 388 amino acid substitutions were identified. Allele frequency spectrum, and nucleotide diversity ({pi}) values revealed the presence of higher proportions of low frequency variants and negative Tajimas D values across ORFs indicated the presence of population expansion. Network analysis highlighted the presence of two major clusters of viral haplotypes, namely, clade G with the S:D614G, RdRp: P323L variants and a variant of clade L [Lv] having the RdRp:A97V variant. Clade G genomes were found to be evolving more rapidly into multiple sub-clusters including clade GH and GR and were also found in higher proportions in three states with highest mortality rates namely, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bornali Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics"},{"author_name":"Bhaswati Pandit","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics"},{"author_name":"Francesca Massi","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"Chloe K.

Rapid sequencing and publication of consensus genomes have enabled phylogenetic analysis of the virus, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 evolves relatively slowly1, but with multiple sites in the genome that appear inconsistent with the overall consensus phylogeny2. To understand these discrepancies, we used veSEQ3, a targeted RNA-seq approach, to quantify minor allele frequencies in 413 clinical samples from two UK locations. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterised by extensive within-host diversity, which is frequently shared among infected individuals with patterns consistent with geographical structure. These results were reproducible in data from two other sequencing locations in the UK, where we find evidence of mixed infection by major circulating lineages with patterns that cannot readily be explained by artefacts in the data. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 diversity is transmissible, and propose that geographic patterns are generated by transient co-circulation of distinct viral populations. Co-transmission of mixed populations could open opportunities for resolving clusters of transmission and understanding pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katrina A Lythgoe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew David Hall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luca Ferretti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mariateresa de Cesare","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"George MacIntyre-Cockett","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amy Trebes","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Newton Otecko","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emma L Wise","author_inst":"University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Nathan Moore","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jessica Lynch","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stephen Kidd","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Matilde Mori","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Anita Justice","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Angie Green","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"M Azim Ansari","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lucie Abeler-Dorner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Catrin E Moore","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tim E.A.

In response, we have rapidly developed repRNA-CoV2S, a stable and highly immunogenic vaccine candidate comprised of an RNA replicon formulated with a novel Lipid InOrganic Nanoparticle (LION) designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery and immunogenicity. We show that intramuscular injection of LION\/repRNA-CoV2S elicits robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a Type 1 T helper response as well as potent T cell responses in mice. Importantly, a single-dose administration in nonhuman primates elicited antibody responses that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2.

Since then, EUA with relaxed regulations were granted to numerous manufacturers and clinical microbiology laboratories to implement in-house testing assays with nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) and subsequently additional specimen types. Because of supply chain shortages leading to competition for reagents, sustaining any significant volume of testing soon became problematic. As a countermeasure, within several weeks the Henry Ford Microbiology Laboratory validated 4 different rtPCR assays and multiple specimen types using NeuMoDX, Diasorin Simplexa, Cepheid and Roche platforms. The purpose of this study was to analyze the analytic sensitivity of these rtPCR assays with NP\/nasal swabs and sputum\/tracheal aspirates.

Molecular Imprinting, indeed, represents a very promising and attractive technology for the synthesis of MIPs characterized by specific recognition abilities for a target molecule. Given these characteristics, MIPs can be considered tailor-made synthetic antibodies obtained by a templating process.In the present study, the developed imprinted polymeric nanoparticles were characterized in terms of particles size and distribution by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and the imprinting effect and selectivity were investigated by performing binding experiments using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the novel coronavirus and the RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein, respectively. Finally, the hemocompatibility of the prepared MIP-based plastic antibodies was also evaluated.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Puoci","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy. - Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health"},{"author_name":"Ortensia Ilaria Parisi","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy. - Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health"},{"author_name":"Marco Dattilo","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy."},{"author_name":"Francesco Patitucci","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy."},{"author_name":"Rocco Malivindi","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy. - Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Pezzi","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy. - Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health"},{"author_name":"Ida Perrotta","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Ecology and Earth Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy."},{"author_name":"Mariarosa Ruffo","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy. - Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health"},{"author_name":"Fabio Amone","author_inst":"Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutrition Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy."},{"author_name":"Kevin E Draves","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samantha Randall","author_inst":"PAI Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kathryn A Guerriero","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Malcolm S Duthie","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Darrick Carter","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Steven G Reed","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"David W Hawman","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale Jr.","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Berglund","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Deborah Heydenburg Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Buck","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John A Todd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tanya Golubchik","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"synthetic biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.120204","rel_title":"Optimizing high-yield production of SARS-CoV-2 soluble spike trimers for serology assays","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.120204","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer is the primary antigen for several serology assays critical to determining the extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the population.

The host response to SARS-CoV2 has not yet been fully delineated, hampering a precise approach to therapy. To address this, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data from the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic targets that could be modified with available drugs. The data suggest that transcriptomic profiling can provide an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in individual patients.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/121889v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7dccedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1190e1forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ee2e67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@289f72_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea R Daamen","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Prathyusha Bachali","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Katherine A Owen","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Kathryn M Kingsmore","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Erika L Hubbard","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Adam C Labonte","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Robert Robl","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Sneha Shrotri","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Amrie C Grammer","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Peter E Lipsky","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Simon Messing","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"William Gillette","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Darrick Carter","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Steven G Reed","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"David W Hawman","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale Jr.","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Berglund","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Deborah Heydenburg Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Buck","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John A Todd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tanya Golubchik","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.120121","rel_title":"Evidence for anti-viral effects of complete Freunds adjuvant in the mouse model of enterovirus infection","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.120121","rel_abs":"Group B Coxsackieviruses belonging to the genus, Enterovirus, contain six serotypes that induce various diseases, whose occurrence may involve the mediation of more than one serotype. We recently identified immunogenic epitopes within CVB3 viral protein 1 that induce anti-viral T cell responses in mouse models of CVB infections. In our investigations to determine the protective responses of the viral epitopes, we unexpectedly noted that animals immunized with complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) alone and later challenged with CVB3 were completely protected against myocarditis. Similarly, the pancreatitis-inducing ability of CVB3 was remarkably reduced to only 10% in the CFA group as opposed to 73.3% in the control group that received no CFA. Additionally, no mortalities were noted in the CFA group, whereas 40% of control animals died during the course of 21 days post-infection with CVB3. Taken together, our data suggest that the adjuvant effects of CFA may be sufficient for protection against CVB infections. These observations may provide new insights into our understanding of the occurrence of viral infections.

We found that although the T lymphocytes were decreased in the blood of patients with virus infection, the remaining T cells still highly expressed inflammatory genes and persisted for a while after recovery in patients. We also observed the potential transition from effector CD8 T cells to central memory T cells in recovered patients at the late stage. Among B lymphocytes, we analyzed the expansion trajectory of a subtype of plasma cells in severe COVID-19 patients and traced the source as atypical memory B cells (AMBCs). Additional BCR and TCR analyses revealed a high level of clonal expansion in patients with severe COVID-19, especially of B lymphocytes, and the clonally expanded B cells highly expressed genes related to inflammatory responses and lymphocyte activation.

However, hospitals in developing countries often cannot measure some of the variables that have been reported as useful. - Objective: To assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the novel LOW-HARM score (Lymphopenia, Oxygen saturation, White blood cells, Hypertension, Age, Renal injury, and Myocardial injury). - Design: Demographic and clinical data from patients with known clinical outcomes (death or discharge) was obtained. Patients were grouped according to their outcome. The LOW-HARM score was calculated for each patient and its distribution, potential cut-off values and demographic data were compared. - Setting: Twelve hospitals in ten different cities in Mexico. - Participants: Data from 438 patients was collected. A total of 400 (200 per group) was included in the analysis. - Exposure: All patients had an infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR. - Main Outcome: The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of different cut-offs of the LOW-HARM score to predict death. - Results: Mean scores at admission and their distributions were significantly lower in patients who were discharged compared to those who died during their hospitalization 10 (SD: 17) vs 70 (SD: 28). The overall AUC of the model was 95%. A cut-off > 65 points had a specificity of 98% and a positive predictive value of 96%. More than a third of the cases (36%) in the sample had a LOW-HARM score > 65 points. - Conclusions and relevance: The LOW-HARM score measured at admission is highly specific and useful for predicting mortality. It is easy to calculate and can be updated with individual clinical progression.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian Soto-Mota","author_inst":"The University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Braulio A.

However, it remains unclear how real-world networks could influence the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches. To address this issue, we simulated control strategies for SARS-CoV-2 in a real-world social network generated from high resolution GPS data3,4. We found that tracing contacts-of-contacts reduced the size of simulated outbreaks more than tracing of only contacts, but resulted in almost half of the local population being quarantined at a single point in time. Testing and releasing non-infectious individuals led to increases in outbreak size, suggesting that contact tracing and quarantine may be most effective when it acts as a \"local lockdown\" when contact rates are high. Finally, we estimated that combining physical distancing with contact tracing could enable epidemic control while reducing the number of quarantined individuals. Our approach highlights the importance of network structure and social dynamics in evaluating the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 control.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Josh A Firth","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Joel Hellewell","author_inst":"Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Londo"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Londo"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

In many European countries and the US, the burden of Covid-19 epidemic could be much lower if Governments had been able to learn from the China and Lombardy stories and to declare full lockdown without delays. Methods. We use a simple game-theoretic framework for the strategic interaction between the Government, political oppositions and lobbies, combined with a Covid-19 transmission model, to analyse the role of political factors delaying the lockdown declaration, depending on the degrees of \"responsibility\" of political actors. Results. The lockdown can always be declared immediately (i.e., without delay) as sustained transmission arises, only if the government feels fully \"responsible\" towards all citizens. If this is not the case, epidemic growth will eventually dominate the agents' payoffs, so that sooner or later the lockdown will always be declared i.e., both the government and the opposition will be forced by the epidemic to switch towards a higher degree of responsibility, but with a delay. There is a further nontrivial situation where the lockdown can be declared without delay, occurring when the political opposition is at least as responsible as the Government. This however requires the solution of a coordination issue, which cannot be taken for granted. Eventually, a vicious circle emerges, where the delayed lockdown requires a much longer lockdown period to achieve adequate control results, thereby causing the explosion of economic losses and so calling for unlocking long before it should. Conclusions. Lockdown delays have dramatically worsened the impact of the current Covid-19 wave in a number of countries. Citizens should be made cogently aware of this to claim maximal responsibility from political actors and economic lobbies to avoid that such stories repeat in the future when further threats, due to Covid-19 itself or other pathogens, will re-appear.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessio Carrozzo Magli","author_inst":"Alma Mater Studiorum"},{"author_name":"Alberto d'Onofrio","author_inst":"Stratchclyde University, Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Piero Manfredi","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

However, despite the diversity of novel theoretical approaches and the comprehensiveness of many widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and intimidating picture. Here we show unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. Our analysis naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental limitation to any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of the testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate information from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of the reporting rates controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak, which typically follows the true one in countries that were not vigorous enough in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of our analysis, as countries that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak earlier and less deaths overall.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timoteo Carletti","author_inst":"University of Namur"},{"author_name":"Duccio Fanelli","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Francesco Piazza","author_inst":"University of Orleans"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Design\/setting: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019 through February 2020) versus after (April 2020) the lockdown. Participants: 20,558 adults ([&ge;]16y). Measurements: The independent variable was the timing of the Covid-19 lockdown in England (before vs. after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking; past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers); past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers); and use of evidence-based (e.g., prescription medication\/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support (telephone support\/websites\/apps) for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers\/high-risk drinkers who made a quit\/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region, and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). Findings: The Covid-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence (17.0% (after) vs. 15.9% (before), OR=1.09[95%CI 0.95-1.24]), but was associated with increases in the rate of quit attempts (39.6% vs. 29.1%, ORadj=1.56[1.23-1.98]) and cessation (8.8% vs. 4.1%, ORadj=2.63[1.69-4.09]) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0% vs. 51.5%, ORadj=1.10[0.72-1.68]) but use of remote support increased (10.9% vs. 2.7%, ORadj=3.59[1.56-8.23]). Lockdown was associated with increases in the prevalence of high-risk drinking (38.3% vs. 25.1%, OR=1.85[1.67-2.06]) but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5% vs. 15.3%, ORadj=2.16[1.77-2.64]). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2% vs. 4.0%, ORadj=0.23[0.05-0.97]) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9% vs. 6.1%, ORadj=1.32[0.64-2.75]). Conclusions: In England, prevalence of high-risk drinking but not smoking has increased since the Covid-19 lockdown. Smokers and high-risk drinkers are more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce their alcohol consumption, and rates of smoking cessation are higher. Smokers are no less likely than before lockdown to use cessation support, with increased uptake of remote support. However, use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers has decreased, with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah E Jackson","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Claire Garnett","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Lion Shahab","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Melissa Oldham","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Jamie Brown","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lewis G.
