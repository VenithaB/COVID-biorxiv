However, the absorption of cotton swab for RNA lysates may lead to a low concentration of detectable RNA, which might be one of the main reasons for the unstable positive detecting rate. We designed and manufactured a kind of silicone swab with concave-convex structure, and further compared the effects of silicone and cotton swab on RNA extraction. Principal component analysis and Paired Wilcoxcon test suggested that a higher RNA concentration and A260\/A280 would be obtained using silicone swab. The results indicated that our silicone swab had a more excellent ability to sample than the cotton swab, characterized by the higher quantity and quality of extracted RNA. Thus, we advised that the current cotton swabs need to be improved urgently in COVID-19 diagnoses and the process of \"sample collection\" and \"sample pre-processing\" must be standardized and emphasized.\n\nHighlightsThe current cotton swabs need to be improved urgently in COVID-19 screening.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianye Zhou","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Zhongtian Bai","author_inst":"The second Department of General Surgery, the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Nan Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Applied Soil Biochemistry, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Li","author_inst":"Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Gansu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Zhang","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Li","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Li","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy of Gastrointestinal Tumor, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongren Ma","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Sto"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044750","rel_title":"Symptom-Based Isolation Policies: Evidence from a Mathematical Model of Outbreaks of Influenza and COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044750","rel_abs":"Background: Controlling the transmission of respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 is a critical public health priority. Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies. Methods: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the population infected) under one or more days of fever-based isolation. Results: Using the model we find evidence that symptom-based isolation policies could reduce the attack rates of both influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks, and flatten the outbreak curves. Specifically, we found that across a range of influenza scenarios, a CDC-recommended policy of one day isolation following fever can reduce the attack rate from 27% of the population to 12%, and to 3% if the isolation is extended to two days. In COVID-19 transmission, we estimate that implementing one day post-fever isolation would reduce the attack rate from 79% to 71%, and there is possible benefit from isolation for six days. In both influenza and COVID-19, the policies are predicted to reduce the peak number of infected but not shorten the outbreak duration. Conclusions: Symptom-based isolation could be an important tool to control influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, and potentially other settings. We recommend that schools implement a post-fever isolation policy of two days for influenza and six days for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam Burns","author_inst":"Loyola University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Alexander Gutfraind","author_inst":"Loyola University Medical Center; University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nan Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Applied Soil Biochemistry, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Li","author_inst":"Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Gansu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Zhang","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Li","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Li","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy of Gastrointestinal Tumor, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongren Ma","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Sto"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.013920","rel_title":"Crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 9, Nsp9","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.013920","rel_abs":"Many of the proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2 have related counterparts across the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) family. One such protein is non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9), which is thought to mediate both viral replication and virulence. Current understanding suggests that Nsp9 is involved in viral genomic RNA reproduction. Nsp9 is thought to bind RNA via a fold that is unique to this class of betacoronoaviruses although the molecular basis for this remains ill-defined. We sought to better characterise the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein and subsequently solved its X-ray crystal structure, in an apo-form and, unexpectedly, in a peptide-bound form with a sequence originating from a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (LEVL). The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 revealed the high level of structural conservation within the Nsp9 family. The exogenous peptide binding site is close to the dimer interface and impacted on the relative juxtaposition of the monomers within the homodimer. Together we have established a protocol for the production of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, determined its structure and identified a peptide-binding site that may warrant further study from the perspective of understanding Nsp9 function.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dene Littler","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Gully","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Rhys N Colson","author_inst":"Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University"},{"author_name":"Jamie Rossjohn","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Zhang","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Li","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Li","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy of Gastrointestinal Tumor, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongren Ma","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Sto"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20045997","rel_title":"Development and external validation of a prognostic multivariable model on admission for hospitalized patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20045997","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has developed rapidly and the ability to stratify the most vulnerable patients is vital. However, routinely used severity scoring systems are often low on diagnosis, even in non-survivors. Therefore, clinical prediction models for mortality are urgently required. Methods: We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model to predict inpatient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients using data collected retrospectively from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan (299 patients). External validation was conducted using a retrospective cohort from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan (145 patients). Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slopes and plots. Findings: The final model included age, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and SpO2 as independent predictors of mortality. Discrimination of the model was excellent in both internal (c=0.89) and external (c=0.98) validation. Internal calibration was excellent (calibration slope=1). External validation showed some over-prediction of risk in low-risk individuals and under-prediction of risk in high-risk individuals prior to recalibration. Recalibration of the intercept and slope led to excellent performance of the model in independent data. Interpretation: COVID-19 is a new disease and behaves differently from common critical illnesses. This study provides a new prediction model to identify patients with lethal COVID-19. Its practical reliance on commonly available parameters should improve usage of limited healthcare resources and patient survival rate.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianfeng Xie","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Daniel Hungerford","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, China"},{"author_name":"Simon T Abrams","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"},{"author_name":"Guozheng Wang","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Yishan Wang","author_inst":"Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Hanyujie Kang","author_inst":"Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Laura Bonnett","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Ruiqiang Zheng","author_inst":"Jiangdu People's Hospital of Yangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xuyan Li","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Tong","author_inst":"Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Bin Du","author_inst":"Jiangdu People's Hospital of Yangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Haibo Qiu","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hock Toh","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20046136","rel_title":"EARLY ESTIMATION OF REPRODUCTION NUMBER OF COVID-19 IN VIETNAM","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20046136","rel_abs":"Reproduction number is an epidemiologic indicator that reflects the contagiousness and transmissibility of infectious agents.

Methods 125 COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study were classified into mild (93 cases) and severe (32 cases) groups, basing on their 3 to 7-days clinical outcomes. Patients' gender, age, comorbid with underlying diseases, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests on admission were collected and subsequently analyzed with single-factor and multivariate logistic regression methods. Finally, we evaluate their prognostic values with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results Seventeen factors on admission differed significantly between mild and severe groups. Next, only four factors, including the comorbid with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24\/min), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP >10mg\/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH >250U\/liter), were found to be independently associated with the later disease development. Prognostic value analysis by ROC indicated that individual factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia, but that the combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH significantly increase the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 0.941, and specificity= 0.902). Three- or four-factors combinations, including elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, further increased the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA post-admission could independently predict the severe illness occurrence. Conclusions General clinical characteristics and laboratory tests, such as combinations consisting of elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, and detectable viral RNA in serum post-admission could provide high confident prognostic value for identifying potential severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuijiang Cai","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yueping Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Youxia Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinqiang Fan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Linghua Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunliang Lei","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengyu Hu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xilong Deng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Tong","author_inst":"Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Bin Du","author_inst":"Jiangdu People's Hospital of Yangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Haibo Qiu","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hock Toh","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20044776","rel_title":"Electrophysiology in the time of coronavirus: coping with the great wave.","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20044776","rel_abs":"Aims: To chart the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activity of interventional electrophysiology services in affected regions. Methods: We reviewed the electrophysiology laboratory records in 3 affected cities: Wenzhou in China, Milan in Italy and London, United Kingdom. We interviewed electrophysiologists in each centre to gather information on the impact of the pandemic on working patterns and on the health of staff members. Results: There was a striking decline in interventional electrophysiology activity in each of the centres. The decline occurred within a week of the recognition of widespread community transmission of the virus in each region and shows a striking correlation with the national figures for new diagnoses of COVID-19 in each case. During the period of restriction, work-flow dropped to <5% of normal, consisting of emergency cases only. In 2 of 3 centres, electrophysiologists were redeployed to perform emergency work outside electrophysiology. Among the centres studied, only Wenzhou has seen a recovery from the restrictions in activity. Following an intense nationwide program of public health interventions, local transmission of COVID-19 ceased to be detectable after February 18th allowing the electrophysiology service to resume with a strict testing regime for all patients. Conclusion: Interventional electrophysiology is vulnerable to closure in times of great social difficulty including the COVID-19 pandemic. Intense public health intervention can permit suppression of local disease transmission allowing resumption of some normal activity.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Mazzone","author_inst":"San Raffaele di Milano"},{"author_name":"Lisa Leung","author_inst":"St George's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Weiqian Lin","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Angelo","author_inst":"San Raffaele di Milano"},{"author_name":"Jun Ma","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Jin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Zaki Akhtar","author_inst":"St. George's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Yuechun Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Paolo E Della Bella","author_inst":"San Raffaele di Milano"},{"author_name":"Jiafeng Lin","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Mark M Gallagher","author_inst":"St. George's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bin Du","author_inst":"Jiangdu People's Hospital of Yangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Haibo Qiu","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hock Toh","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044404","rel_title":"Clear plastic drapes may be effective at limiting aerosolization and droplet spray during extubation: implications for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044404","rel_abs":"Protection of frontline HCPs is paramount.

Methods: Available data from PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, WanFang Database and VIP Database, were analyzed using a fixed effects model meta-analysis to derive overall odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Funnel plots and Begg's were used to assess publication bias. Findings: Of 182 articles found following our initial search, we assessed 34 full-text articles, of which 9 articles with 1936 COVID-19 patients met all selection criteria for our meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity between studies. There were significant correlations between COVID-19 severity and hypertension [OR=2.3 [95% CI (1.76, 3.00), P<0.01], diabetes [OR=2.67, 95% CI (1.91, 3.74), P<0.01], coronary heart disease [OR=2.85 [95% CI (1.68, 4.84), P<0.01].

Italy, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, the US and Japan are probably the countries with the most severe outbreaks. Collecting epidemiological data and predicting epidemic trends are important for the development and measurement of public intervention strategies. Epidemic prediction results yielded by different mathematical models are inconsistent; therefore, we sought to compare different models and their prediction results to generate objective conclusions. Methods: We used the number of cases reported from January 23 to March 20, 2020, to estimate the possible spread size and peak time of COVID-19, especially in 8 high-risk countries. The logistic growth model, basic SEIR model and adjusted SEIR model were adopted for prediction. Given that different model inputs may infer different model outputs, we implemented three model predictions with three scenarios of epidemic development. Results: When comparing all 8 countries short-term prediction results and peak predictions, the differences among the models were relatively large. The logistic growth model estimated a smaller epidemic size than the basic SERI model did; however, once we added parameters that considered the effects of public health interventions and control measures, the adjusted SERI model results demonstrated a considerably rapid deceleration of epidemic development. Our results demonstrated that contact rate, quarantine scale, and the initial quarantine time and length are important factors in controlling epidemic size and length. Conclusions: We demonstrated a comparative assessment of the predictions of the COVID-19 outbreak in eight high-risk countries using multiple methods. By forecasting epidemic size and peak time as well as simulating the effects of public health interventions, the intent of this paper is to help clarify the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and recommend operation suggestions to slow down the epidemic. It is suggested that the quick detection of cases, sufficient implementation of quarantine and public self-protection behaviors are critical to slow down the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiang Zhou","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xudong Ma","author_inst":"National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Na Hong","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity. Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbreaks under immediate control when needed. This is as yet untested even for a combination of national interventions including case isolation, household quarantine, population-wide social distancing and closure of schools and universities. Although there are disadvantages to both types of approach, suppression has the advantage of buying time until a vaccine and\/or treatment become available and allowing NZ to learn from rapidly unfolding events in other countries. A combination of successful suppression, strong border measures, and widespread contact tracing and testing resulting in containment could allow periods when control measures can be relaxed, but only if cases are reduced to a handful.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Yingying Ma","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

We analyze the rate  in different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate  and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. We analyze a {\\it base} set of 42 countries, which developed the epidemic at an earlier stage, an {\\it intermediate} set of 88 countries and an {\\it extended} set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently. Fitting with a linear behavior (T), we find increasing evidence in the three datasets for a decreasing growth rate as a function of T, at $99.66\\%$C.L., $99.86\\%$C.L. and $99.99995 \\%$ C.L. ($p$-value $5 \\cdot 10^{-7}$, or 5$\\sigma$ detection) in the {\\it base}, {\\it intermediate} and {\\it extended} dataset, respectively. The doubling time is expected to increase by $40\\%\\sim 50\\%$, going from $5^\\circ$ C to $25^\\circ$ C. In the {\\it base} set, going beyond a linear model, a peak at about $(7.7\\pm 3.6)^\\circ C$ seems to be present in the data, but such evidence disappears for the larger datasets. Moreover we have analyzed the possible existence of a bias: poor countries, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing. By excluding countries below a given GDP per capita from the dataset, we find that this affects our conclusions only slightly and only for the {\\it extended} dataset. The significance always remains high, with a $p$-value of about $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ or less. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the next cold season.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessio Notari","author_inst":"Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Yingying Ma","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus has emerged. This has suddenly turned out into global health concern. Objectives: Aim of this research is to focus on the bibliometric aspects in order to measure what is published in the first 30-days of a global epidemic outbreak Methods: We searched PubMed database in order to find all relevant studies in the first 30-days from the first publication. Results: From the initial 442 identified articles, 234 were read in-extenso. The majority of papers come from China, UK and USA. 63.7% of the papers were commentaries, editorials and reported data and only 17.5% of the sources used data directly collected on the field. Topics mainly addressed were epidemiology, preparedness and generic discussion. NNR showed a reduction for both the objectives assessed from January to February. Conclusions: Diagnosis and effective preventive and therapeutic measures were the fields in which more research is still needed. The vast majority of scientific literature in the first 30-days of an epidemic outbreak is based on reported data rather than primary data. Nevertheless, the scientific statements and public health decisions rely on these data.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"DAVIDE GORI","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Erik Boetto","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Maria Pia Fantini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Yingying Ma","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

Its primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel or in aerosols for upto 3 hours and is relatively more stable than the known human coronaviruses. It is stable in faeces at room temperature for at least 1-2 days and can be stable in infected patients for up to 4 days. Heat at 56 degree Celsius kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes.

METHODS We used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing: targeted testing of high-risk individuals (n=4,551) and a population screening (n=5,502). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 340 individuals. RESULTS On March 22 2020, 528 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the targeted testing (11.6%) and 50 in the population screening (0.9%); approximately 0.2% of the Icelandic population. Large fractions of positives had travelled outside Iceland (38.4% and 34.0%). Fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older: 2.8% vs. 12.3% for targeted testing (P=1.6e-9) and 0.0% vs. 1.0% for population screening (P=0.031). Fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males (9.5% vs. 14.6%, P=6.8e-9). SARS-CoV-2 came from eight clades, seven A clades and one B clade. The clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time. In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of clades were A2a1 and A2a2 derived from Italian and Austrian skiing areas, but in the later targeted testing went down to 30.6% and were overtaken by A1a and A2a, the most common clades in the population screening. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 has spread widely in Iceland outside of the high-risk groups. Several strains cause these infections and their relative contribution changed rapidly. Children and females are less vulnerable than adults and males. To contain the pandemic we must increase the scope of the testing.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel F Gudbjartsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Agnar Helgason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hakon Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafur T Magnusson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044628","rel_title":"First month of the epidemic caused by COVID-19 in Italy: current status and real-time outbreak development forecast","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044628","rel_abs":"Background: The first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions. Results: We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases, and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases, of patients quarantined at home (42%), hospitalized in non-intensive care (31%), recovered or discharged (13%), deceased (10%), and hospitalized in intensive care (4%). The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 115,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic not less than 2 months. Conclusions: Once month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rosario Megna","author_inst":"National Council of Research"},{"author_name":"Agnar Helgason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hakon Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafur T Magnusson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20046177","rel_title":"A data-driven tool for tracking and predicting the course of COVID-19 epidemic as it evolves","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20046177","rel_abs":"New COVID-19 epicenters have sprung up in Europe and US as the epidemic in China wanes. Many mechanistic models past predictions for China were widely off the mark (1, 2), and still vary widely for the new epicenters, due to uncertain disease characteristics. The epidemic ended in Wuhan, and later in South Korea, with less than 1% of their population infected, much less than that required to achieve herd immunity. Now as most countries pursue the goal of suppressed equilibrium, the traditional concept of herd immunity in epidemiology needs to be re-examined. Traditional model predictions of large potential impacts serve their purpose in prompting policy decisions on contact suppression and lockdown to combat the spread, and are useful for evaluating various scenarios. After imposition of these measures it is important to turn to statistical models that incorporate real-time information that reflects ongoing policy implementation and degrees of compliance to more realistically track and project the course of the epidemic. Here we apply such a tool, supported by theory and validated by past data as accurate, to US and Europe. Most countries started with a Reproduction Number of 4 and declined to around 1 at a rate highly dependent on contact-reduction measures.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Norden E Huang","author_inst":"First Institute of Oceanography"},{"author_name":"Fangli Qiao","author_inst":"First Institute of Oceanography"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Ka-Kit Tung","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044651","rel_title":"A deductive approach to modeling the spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044651","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), previously known as 2019-nCoV, is responsible for the atypical pneumonia pandemic designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We have developed an exponential regression model using the COVID-19 case data (Jan 22 - Mar 22, 2020). Our primary model uses designated Phase 1 countries, who exceed 2500 cases on Mar 22. The model is then applied to Phase 2 countries: those that escaped the initial Phase 1 global expansion of COVID-19. With the exception of stabilizing countries (South Korea, Japan, and Iran) all Phase 1 countries are growing exponentially, as per I2500(t)=120.4 x e0.238t, with a rate, r = 0.238 {+\/-} 0.068. Excluding China, the BRICS developing nations and Australia are in Phase 2. Case data from Phase 2 countries are following the model derived from Phase 1 countries. In the absence of measures employed to flatten the curve including social distancing, quarantine, and healthcare expansion, our model projects over 274,000 cases and 12,300 deaths in the US by Mar 31. India can expect 123,000 cases by April 16. By flattening the curve to the growth rate of stabilizing countries (r = 0.044 {+\/-} 0.062), the US would prevent 8,500 deaths by Mar 31, and India would prevent 5,500 deaths by April 16.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pranav Kumar Mishra","author_inst":"Kasturba Medical College, Manipal;

Methods: We conducted a literature review of studies (n=12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n=11) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. Results: The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control\/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and\/or higher doses than typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs\/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression. Conclusion: Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI\/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19. We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishna Sriram","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Paul A.

The current study describes the situation of the outbreak of this disease in India and predicts the number of cases expected to rise in India. The study also discusses the regional analysis of Indian states and presents the preparedness level of India in combating this outbreak. The study uses exploratory data analysis to report the current situation and uses time-series forecasting methods to predict the future trends. The data has been considered from the repository of John Hopkins University and covers up the time period from 30th January 2020 when the first case occurred in India till the end of 24th March 2020 when the Prime Minister of India declared a complete lockdown in the country for 21 days starting 25th March 2020. The major findings show that number of infected cases in India is rising quickly with the average infected cases per day rising from 10 to 73 from the first case to the 300th case. The current mortality rate for India stands around 1.9. Kerala and Maharashtra are the top two infected states in India with more than 100 infected cases reported in each state, respectively. A total of 25 states have reported at least one infected case, however only 8 of them have reported deaths due to COVID-19. The ARIMA model prediction shows that the infected cases in India may reach up to 700 thousands in next 30 days in worst case scenario while most optimistic scenario may restrict the numbers up to 1000-1200. Also, the average forecast by ARIMA model in next 30 days is around 7000 patients from the current numbers of 536. Based on the forecasting model by Holts linear trends, an expected 3 million people may get infected if control measures are not taken in the near future. This study will be useful for the key stakeholders like Government Officials and Medical Practitioners in assessing the trends for India and preparing a combat plan with stringent measures. Also, this study will be helpful for data scientists, statisticians, mathematicians and analytics professionals in predicting outbreak numbers with better accuracy.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajan Gupta","author_inst":"University of Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Saibal Kumar Pal","author_inst":"DRDO, India"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Ka-Kit Tung","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044644","rel_title":"Doubling time tells how effective Covid-19 prevention works","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044644","rel_abs":"Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a rapidly spreading pandemic in many countries.

Tracking the time-dependent doubling time tells how well Covid-19 prevention works, giving an index for successful fighting.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Byung Mook Weon","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Saibal Kumar Pal","author_inst":"DRDO, India"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Ka-Kit Tung","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20044578","rel_title":"Government Responses Matter: Predicting Covid-19 cases in US under an empirical Bayesian time series framework","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20044578","rel_abs":"Since the Covid-19 outbreak, researchers have been predicting how the epidemic will evolve, especially the number in each country, through using parametric extrapolations based on the history. In reality, the epidemic progressing in a particular country depends largely on its policy responses and interventions. Since the outbreaks in some countries are earlier than United States, the prediction of US cases can benefit from incorporating the similarity in their trajectories. We propose an empirical Bayesian time series framework to predict US cases using different countries as prior reference. The resultant forecast is based on observed US data and prior information from the reference country while accounting for different population sizes. When Italy is used as prior in the prediction, which the US data resemble the most, the cases in the US will exceed 300,000 by the beginning of April unless strong measures are adopted.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ziyue Liu","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Wensheng Guo","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Ka-Kit Tung","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20044495","rel_title":"An alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 - escape from the NA extraction kit-shortage","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20044495","rel_abs":"Abstract The World Health Organisation has declared a pandemic caused by the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2.

Director-General declared that \"the threat of a global pandemic has become a reality\", and the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has become a global concern. Chinese efforts in curbing the virus have widely been recognized. Even the WHO has lauded the efforts of the Chinese government and advised the world to learn from China in fighting the disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, to curb the spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government has implemented unprecedented prevention interventions at the nationwide level. Currently, the outbreak in Wuhan is changing in a positive direction and has been effectively controlled. However, it is not clear what these measures were and how these measures changed to curb the outbreak of COVID-19 quickly. This study explored the characteristics and identified that China's control strategies have changed the epidemiological curve of rapidly rising new confirmed cases of COVID-19. This study also seeks to expand the experiences and lessons from this outbreak. Methods: We collected public health interventions measures from Jan 20, 2020, to 5 March 2020, and data from COVID-19 daily newly confirmed cases and daily cumulates cases to compare the control effects and changing trends. We performed a retrospective description of these intervention strategies from three stages. Besides, from the perspective of public health, the experiences and lessons exposed by this outbreak were roughly summarized. Results: These non-pharmacology interventions measures adopted by the Chinese government by the instruction and spirit of President Xi Jinping were timely and efficient. Conclusions: The present study was conducted to comprehensively analyze from a social epidemiology context. The results confirmed that these radical interventions taken by the Chinese government were effective, ambitious, and agile. However, we must be aware that the epidemic situation in Wuhan is still challenging.

Deep learning was reported to discover intricate structures from clinical images and achieve expert-level performance in medical image analysis. To develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework on chest CT images for auto-detection of NCP, particularly focusing on differentiating NCP from influenza pneumonia (IP). Methods: 35 confirmed NCP cases were consecutively enrolled as training set from 1138 suspected patients in three NCP designated hospitals together with 361 confirmed viral pneumonia patients from center one including 156 IP patients, from May, 2015 to February, 2020. The external validation set enrolled 57 NCP patients and 50 IP patients from eight centers. Results: 96.6% of NCP lesions were larger than 1 cm and 76.8% were with intensity below -500 Hu, indicating less consolidation than IP lesions which had nodules ranging 5-10 mm. The classification schemes accurately distinguished NCP and IP lesions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) above 0.93. The Trinary scheme was more device-independent and consistent with specialists than the Plain scheme, which achieved a F1 score of 0.847, higher than the Plain scheme (0.774), specialists (0.785) and residents (0.644). Conclusions: Our study potentially provides an accurate early diagnosis tool on chest CT for NCP with high transferability, and shows high efficiency in differentiating NCP and IP, helping to reduce misdiagnosis and contain the pandemic transmission.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Min Zhou","author_inst":"Ruijin hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of

Conclusions: No SARS-CoV-2 was expressed in EPS of patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"weihe quan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"qingyou zheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"jinfei tian","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"jun chen","author_inst":"Xiangyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"zhigang liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"xiangqiu chen","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"tao wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"ziliang ji","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"jinqi tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"hao chu","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"haijia xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"yong zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xin Xu","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jingqi Wei","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mingxin Guan","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianxing Feng","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jieming Qu","author_inst":"Ruijin hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"urology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20043471","rel_title":"Disposable N95 Masks Pass Qualitative Fit-Test But Have Decreased Filtration Efficiency after Cobalt-60 Gamma Irradiation","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20043471","rel_abs":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals around the globe. One component of PPE that is in particular demand are disposable N95 face masks. To alleviate this, many methods of N95 mask sterilization have been studied and proposed with the hope of being able to safely reuse masks. Two major considerations must be made when re-sterilizing masks: (1) the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens, penetrating into the fibers of the mask, and (2) the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters. We studied Cobalt-60 gamma irradiation as a method of effective sterilization without inducing mask degradation. Significant literature exists supporting the use of gamma radiation as a sterilization method, with viral inactivation of SARS-CoV reported at doses of at most 10 kGy, with other studies supporting 5 kGy for many types of viruses. However, concerns have been raised about the radiation damaging the fiber material within the mask, specifically by causing cross-linking of polymers, leading to cracking and degradation during fitting and\/or deployment. A set of 3M 8210 and 9105 masks were irradiated using MIT's Co-60 irradiator. Three masks of each type received 0 kiloGray (kGy), 10 kGy and 50 kGy of approximately 1.3 MeV gamma radiation from the circular cobalt sources, at a dose rate of 2.2 kGy per hour. Following this sterilization procedure, the irradiated masks passed a OSHA Gerson Qualitative Fit Test QLFT 50 (saccharin apparatus) when donned correctly, performed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, in a blinded study repeated in triplicate. However, the masks' filtration of 0.3 um particles was significantly degraded, even at 10 kGy. These results suggest against gamma, and possibly all ionizing radiation, as a method of disposable N95 sterilization. Even more importantly, they argue against using the qualitative fit test alone to assess mask integrity.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avilash Cramer","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Enze Tian","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sherryl H Yu","author_inst":"Harvard Combined Dermatology Residency Training Program"},{"author_name":"Mitchell Galanek","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Edward Lamere","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ju Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Gupta","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael P Short","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"jinqi tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"hao chu","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"haijia xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"yong zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xin Xu","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jingqi Wei","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mingxin Guan","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianxing Feng","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jieming Qu","author_inst":"Ruijin hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"}]}
