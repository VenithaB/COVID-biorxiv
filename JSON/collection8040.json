Lung injury has been reported as the major outcome of COVID-19 infection. However, liver damage has also been considered to occur in severe cases. Current meta-analysis of retrospective studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between liver injury and severity of COVID-19 infection. Methods: Online databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 April 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, a fixed- or random-effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity between studies. Furthermore, publication bias test and sensitivity analysis were also done. Results: In total, 20 retrospective studies with 3,428 COVID-19 infected patients (severe cases = 1,455 and mild cases = 1,973), were included in this meta-analysis. Higher serum levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 8.84 U\/L, 95% CI = 5.97 to 11.71, P<0.001), Alanine aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 7.35 U\/L, 95% CI = 4.77 to 9.93, P<0.001), total Bilirubin (weighted mean difference = 2.30 mmol\/L, 95% CI = 1.24 to 3.36, P<0.001) and lower serum levels of Albumin (weighted mean difference = -4.24 g\/L, 95% CI = -6.20 to -2.28, P<0.001), were associated with a significant increase in the severity of COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: The incidence of liver injury seems to be higher in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. This finding could help physicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Parohan","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sajad Yaghoubi","author_inst":"Iranshahr University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Asal Seraj","author_inst":"Islamic Azad University, Damavand Branch"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20054346","rel_title":"The Framework for the Prediction of the Critical Turning Period for Outbreak of COVID-19 Spread in China based on the iSEIR Model","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20054346","rel_abs":"The goal of this study is to establish a general framework for predicting the so-called critical Turning Period in an infectious disease epidemic such as the COVID-19 outbreak in China early this year. This framework enabled a timely prediction of the turning period when applied to Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic and informed the relevant authority for taking appropriate and timely actions to control the epidemic. It is expected to provide insightful information on turning period for the world's current battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of differential equations extending the classic SEIR model. We used the observed daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 cases dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare aftermath planning. Our study also supports the observed effectiveness on flatting the epidemic curve by decisively imposing the Lockdown and Isolation Control Program in Wuhan since January 23, 2020.

In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical droplet precaution to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability\/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, given that asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks within the public, can be highly contagious for COVID-19, prevention of environmental droplet contamination (EnDC) from coughing\/sneezing\/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote public droplet safety, we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal community droplet reduction solution is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 social distancing. All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to <30cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask\/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to <10cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a community droplet reduction solution (i.e., face covers\/scarfs\/masks & surface covers) could reduce EnDC and the risk of transmitting or acquiring infectious respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Rodriguez-Palacios","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fabio Cominelli","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Abigail Basson","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theresa Pizarro","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University  School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sanja Ilic","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Richard S.

Diagnostic performance was computed for a system trained on CXRs of Italian subjects from two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. Methods We used for training and internal testing an ensemble of ten convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with mainly bedside CXRs of 250 COVID-19 and 250 non-COVID-19 subjects from two hospitals. We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as reference standard. Results At 10-fold cross-validation, our AI model classified COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85) and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91). For the independent dataset, AI showed 0.80 sensitivity (95% CI 0.72-0.86) (59\/74), 0.81 specificity (29\/36) (95% CI 0.73-0.87), and 0.81 AUC (95% CI 0.73-0.87). Radiologists reading obtained 0.63 sensitivity (95% CI 0.52-0.74) and 0.78 specificity (95% CI 0.61-0.90) in one centre and 0.64 sensitivity (95% CI 0.52-0.74) and 0.86 specificity (95% CI 0.71-0.95) in the other.

Data and Method Data from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Sichuan Province were obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NNDRS) and field survey. We collected information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and the length of hospital stay for confirmed patients. We conducted an exploratory analysis using adjusted multivariate cox-proportional models. Participants A total of 538 confirmed patients of COVID-19 infection in Sichuan Province from January to March 2020. Outcome measure The length of hospital stay after admissions for confirmed patients. Results From January 16, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 538 human cases of COVID-19 infection were laboratory-confirmed, and were hospitalized for treatment. Among these, 271 (50%) were 45 years of age or above, 285 (53%) were male, 450 (84%) were considered as having mild symptoms. The median hospital length of stay was 19 days (interquartile range (IQR): 14-23, Range: 3-41). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that longer hospital length of stay was associated with factors aged 45 and over (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60-0.91), those admitted to provincial hospital (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.99), and those with serious illness (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.90); living in areas with more than 5.5 healthcare workers per 1000 population (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.65) was associated with shorter hospital length of stay.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of several adjuvant treatments in preventing severe pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 564 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha Public Health Treatment Center, First Hospital of Yueyang, Junshan People's Hospital of Yueyang, Central Hospital of Shaoyang, Central Hospital of Xiangtan, Second Hospital of Changde, Central Hospital of Loudi, and First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China in Hunan province from January 17, 2020 to February 28, 2020; The final date of follow-up was March 15, 2020. EXPOSURES Nonspecific antivirals (arbidol, lopinavir\/ritonavir, and interferon ), antihypertensives, and chloroquine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia; Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Of 564 patients, the median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-58 years), and 284 (50.4%) patients were men. Sixty-nine patients (12.2%) developed severe pneumonia. Patients who developed severe pneumonia were older (median age of 59 and 45 years, respectively), and more patients had comorbidities including hypertension (30.4% and 12.3%, respectively), diabetes (17.4% and 6.7%, respectively), and cardiovascular disease (8.7% and 3.2%, respectively) and presented with fever (84.1% and 60.4%, respectively) and shortness of breath (10.1% and 3.8%, respectively) compared with those who did not. Nonspecific antiviral therapy did not prevent clinical progression to severe pneumonia, although fewer hypertensive patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEI\/ARB) therapy developed severe pneumonia in contrast with those on non-ACEI\/ARB antihypertensive therapy (1 of 16 [6.3%] patients and 16 of 49 [32.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 26.4%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 41.3%]). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension without receiving ACEI\/ARB therapy was an independent risk factor (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.00) for developing severe pneumonia irrespective of age. Besides, none of patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia, though without significance (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, -3.5% to 30.0%) by propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hypertensive patients on ACEI or ARB may be protective from severe pneumonia in COVID-19 and hence these therapies should not be ceased unless there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence. Though none of the current antiviral and immunoregulation therapy showed benefit in preventing COVID-19 progression, chloroquine deserved further investigation.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhichao Feng","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Li","author_inst":"Westmead Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Shanhu Yao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qizhi Yu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Wenming Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, First Hospital of Yueyang"},{"author_name":"Xiaowen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Central Hospital of Shaoyang"},{"author_name":"Huiling Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wendi Kang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xin Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Xiangtan"},{"author_name":"Ji Mei","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Second Hospital of Changde"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Loudi"},{"author_name":"Jincai Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqian Ma","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Rong","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xianping Wu","author_inst":"Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058578","rel_title":"The Role of Vitamin D in Suppressing Cytokine Storm in COVID-19 Patients and Associated Mortality","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058578","rel_abs":"Abstract Objectives To investigate the possible role of Vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency via unregulated inflammation in COVID-19 complications and associated mortality. Design The time-adjusted case mortality ratio (T-CMR) was estimated as the number of deceased patients on day N divided by the number of confirmed cases on day N-8. The adaptive average of T-CMR (A-CMR) was further calculated as a metric of COVID-19 associated mortality in different countries. A model based on positivity change (PC) and an estimated prevalence of COVID-19 was developed to determine countries with similar screening strategies. Mean concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in elderly individuals in countries with similar screening strategies were compared to investigate the potential impact of Vit D on A-CMR. We analyzed data showing a possible association between high C-Reactive Protein (CRP) concentration (CRP greater than or equal to 1 mg\/dL) and severe COVID-19. We estimated a link between Vit D status and high CRP in healthy subjects (CRP greater than or equal to 0.2 mg\/dL) with an adjustment for age and income to explore the possible role of Vit D in reducing complications attributed to unregulated inflammation and cytokine production. Data Sources Daily admission, recovery, and deceased rate data for patients with COVID-19 were collected from Kaggle as of April 20, 2020. Screening data were collected from Our World in Data and official statements from public authorities. The mean concentration of 25(OH)D among the elderly for comparison with A-CMR was collected from previously published studies from different countries. Chronic factor data used in regression analysis was obtained from published articles. The correlation between Vit D and CRP was calculated based on 9,212 subject-level data from NHANES, 2009-2010. Results A link between 25(OH)D and A-CMR in the US, France, Iran and the UK (countries with similar screening status) may exist. We observed an inverse correlation (correlation coefficient ranging from -0.84 to -1) between high CRP and 25(OH)D. Age and the family income status also correlated to high CRP and subjects with higher age and lower family income presented more incidences of high CRP. Our analysis determined a possible link between high CRP and Vit D deficiency and calculated an OR of 1.8 with 95%CI (1.2 to 2.6) among the elderly (age greater than or equal to 60 yo) in low-income families and an OR of 1.9 with 95%CI (1.4 to 2.7) among the elderly (age greater than or equal to 60 yo) in high-income families. COVID-19 patient-level data shows a notable OR of 3.4 with 95%CI (2.15 to 5.4) for high CRP in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Given that CRP is a surrogate marker for cytokine storm and is associated with Vit D deficiency, based on retrospective data and indirect evidence we see a possible role of Vit D in reducing complications attributed to unregulated inflammation and cytokine storm. Further research is needed to account for other factors through direct measurement of Vit D levels in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali Daneshkhah","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Vasundhara Agrawal","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Adam Eshein","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Hariharan Subramanian","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Hemant Kumar Roy","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Vadim Backman","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Huiling Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wendi Kang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xin Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Xiangtan"},{"author_name":"Ji Mei","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Second Hospital of Changde"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Loudi"},{"author_name":"Jincai Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqian Ma","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Rong","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xianping Wu","author_inst":"Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20051474","rel_title":"Variation in False Negative Rate of RT-PCR Based SARS-CoV-2 Tests by Time Since Exposure","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20051474","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR based tests are being used to rule out infection among high-risk individuals such as exposed inpatients and healthcare workers. It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset in order to avoid being falsely reassured by negative tests. As such, the goal of our study was to estimate the false negative rate by day since infection. We used previously published data on RT-PCR sensitivity on samples derived from nasal swabs by day since symptom onset (n=633) and fit a cubic polynomial spline to calculate the false negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. Over the four days of infection prior to the typical time of symptom onset (day 5) the probability of a false negative test in an infected individual falls from 100% on day one (95% CI 69-100%) to 61% on day four (95% CI 18-98%), though there is considerable uncertainty in these numbers. On the day of symptom onset, the median false negative rate was 39% (95% CI 16-77%). This decreased to 26% (95% CI 18-34%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset), then began to rise again, from 27% (95% CI 20-34%) on day 9 to 61% (95% CI 54-67%) on day 21. Care must be taken when interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly if performed early in the course of infection, when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If there is high clinical suspicion, patients should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lauren Kucirka","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen Lauer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Oliver Laeyendecker","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Denali Boon","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vadim Backman","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Huiling Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wendi Kang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xin Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Xiangtan"},{"author_name":"Ji Mei","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Second Hospital of Changde"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Loudi"},{"author_name":"Jincai Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqian Ma","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Rong","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xianping Wu","author_inst":"Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20051060","rel_title":"The respiratory sound features of COVID-19 patients fill gaps between clinical data and screening methods","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20051060","rel_abs":"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has continuous outbreaks around the world. Lung is the main organ that be involved. There is a lack of clinical data on the respiratory sounds of COVID-19 infected pneumonia, which includes invaluable information concerning physiology and pathology. The medical resources are insufficient, which are now mainly supplied for the severe patients. The development of a convenient and effective screening method for mild or asymptomatic suspicious patients is highly demanded. Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. 10 patients with positive results of nucleic acid were enrolled in this study. Lung auscultation was performed by the same physician on admission using a hand-held portable electronic stethoscope delivered in real time via Bluetooth. The recorded audio was exported, and was analyzed by six physicians. Each physician individually described the abnormal breathing sounds that he heard. The results were analyzed in combination with clinical data. Signal analysis was used to quantitatively describe the most common abnormal respiratory sounds. Results: All patients were found abnormal breath sounds at least by 3 physicians, and one patient by all physicians. Cackles, asymmetrical vocal resonance and indistinguishable murmurs are the most common abnormal breath sounds. One asymptomatic patient was found vocal resonance, and the result was correspondence with radiographic computed tomography. Signal analysis verified the credibility of the above abnormal breath sounds. Conclusions: This study describes respiratory sounds of patients with COVID-19, which fills up for the lack of clinical data and provides a simple screening method for suspected patients.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ying hui Huang","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping, Nanping"},{"author_name":"Si jun Meng","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shui sheng Wu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ya wei Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi xiang Ye","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Qi feng Wei","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Nian gui Zhao","author_inst":"The Second Afficiated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20053124","rel_title":"Recent update on COVID-19 in India: Is locking down the country enough?","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20053124","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: India is the second-largest population in the world, and it is not well equipped, hitherto, in the scenario of the global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 could impart a devastating impact on the Indian population. Only way to respond against this critical condition is by practicing large-scale social distancing. India lock down for 21 days, however, till 7 April 2020, SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were growing exponentially, which raises the concerns if the number of reported and actual cases are similar. Methods: We use Lasso Regression with =0.12 and Polynomial features of degree 2 to predict the growth factor. Also, we predicted Logistic curve using the Prophet Python. Further, using the growth rate to logistic, and carrying capacity is 20000 allowed us to calculate the maximum cases and new cases per day. Results: We found the predicted growth factor with a standard deviation of 0.3443 for the upcoming days. When the growth factor becomes 1.0, which is known as Inflection point, it will be safe to state that the rate is no longer exponential. The estimated time to reach the inflection point is between 15-20 April. At that time, the estimated number of total positive cases will be over 12500, if lockdown remains continue. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that there is an urgent need to take action to extend the period of lockdown and allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. Otherwise, the outbreak in India can reach the level of the USA or Italy or could be worse than these countries within a few days or weeks, given the size of the population and lack of resources.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jitender Singh Virk","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, IIT Ropar"},{"author_name":"Syed Azmal Ali","author_inst":"National Dairy Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Gurjeet Kaur","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Shui sheng Wu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ya wei Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi xiang Ye","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Qi feng Wei","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Nian gui Zhao","author_inst":"The Second Afficiated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20057281","rel_title":"Spatial modeling cannot currently differentiate SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and human distributions on the basis of climate in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20057281","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is wreaking havoc globally, yet knowledge of its biology is limited. Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest a link between SARS-CoV-2 and cool weather. One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in a population equilibrium. While these issues should be considered, climate still may be important for predicting the future distribution of SARS-CoV-2. To further examine if there is a link, we model with raw cases and population scaled cases for SARS-CoV-2 county-level data from the United States. We show that SDMs built from population scaled cases data cannot be distinguished from control models built from raw human population data, while SDMs built on raw data fail to predict the current known distribution of cases in the US. The population scaled analyses indicate that climate may not play a central role in current US viral distribution and that human population density is likely a primary driver. Still, we do find slightly more population scaled viral cases in cooler areas. This coupled with our geographically constrained focus make it so we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the US SARS-CoV-2 distribution. Climate's role on SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS-CoV-2 can spread anywhere in the US.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert S Harbert","author_inst":"Stonehill College"},{"author_name":"Seth W Cunningham","author_inst":"American Museum of Natural History"},{"author_name":"Michael Tessler","author_inst":"American Museum of Natural History"},{"author_name":"Shui sheng Wu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ya wei Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi xiang Ye","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Qi feng Wei","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Nian gui Zhao","author_inst":"The Second Afficiated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20052340","rel_title":"COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20052340","rel_abs":"Introduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold. An earlier lockdown could have saved many lives.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Greg Dropkin","author_inst":"independent researcher"},{"author_name":"Seth W Cunningham","author_inst":"American Museum of Natural History"},{"author_name":"Michael Tessler","author_inst":"American Museum of Natural History"},{"author_name":"Shui sheng Wu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ya wei Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi xiang Ye","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Qi feng Wei","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Nian gui Zhao","author_inst":"The Second Afficiated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20057133","rel_title":"On Data-Driven Management of the COVID-19 Outbreak in South Africa","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20057133","rel_abs":"The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has highlighted the need for the development of rapid mitigating responses under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

The results suggest two plausible hypotheses - either the COVID-19 pandemic is still at very early stages of progression in South Africa or a combination of prompt mitigating measures, demographics and social factors have resulted in a slowdown in its spread and severity.

In the current context of high incidence rates of SARS-CoV2 in the community, a significant increase in the rate of nosocomial transmission is expected. The risk of nosocomial transmission could even be higher in low-income countries that have fragile healthcare systems. This protocol is intended to study and document suspected or confirmed cases of nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infection, the clinical spectrum and the determinants (risk factors\/protective) at participating hospitals. Methods and analysis: This will be an international multicentre prospective, observational, hospital-based study in adults and children. It will include volunteer patients, care givers and healthcare professionals in France and hospitals affiliated with the GABRIEL network. Demographic and clinical data will be collected using case-report forms designed especially for the purpose of the project. A nasopharyngeal swab will be collected and tested for SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR. Characteristics of the study participants, the proportion of confirmed nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infections relative to all patients with syndromes suggestive of 2019-nCoV infection will be analysed. Appropriate multivariate modelling will be used to identify the determinants associated with nosocomial onset.

At present, estimates for the CFR of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection vary considerably. Expert consensus of 0.1-1% covers in practical terms a range from normal seasonable Influenza to Spanish Influenza. In the following, I deduce a formula for an adjusted Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) to assess mortality in a period following a positive test adjusted for selection bias. Official datasets on cases and deaths were combined with data sets on number of tests. After data curation and quality control, a total of IFR (n=819) was calculated for 21 countries for periods of up to 26 days between registration of a case and death. Estimates for IRFs increased with length of period, but levelled off at >9days with a median for all 21 countries of 0.11 (95%-CI: 0.073-0.15). An epidemiologically derived IFR of 0.040 % (95%-CI: 0.029%-0.055%) was determined for Iceland and was very close to the calculated IFR of 0.057% (95%-CI: 0.042-0.078), but 2.7-6-fold lower than CFRs. IFRs, but not CFRs, were positively associated with increased proportions of elderly in age-cohorts (n=21, spearman's {rho} =.73, p =.02). Real-time data on molecular and serological testing may further displace classical diagnosis of disease and its related death. I will critically discuss, why, how and under which conditions the IFR, provides a more solid early estimate of the global burden of a pandemic than the CFR.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Perikles Simon","author_inst":"Johannes Gutenberg-University"},{"author_name":"Valentina Picot-Sanchez","author_inst":"Fondation Merieux, France"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Henaff","author_inst":"Laboratoire des Pathogenes Emergents, Fondation Merieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111, CNRS, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Florence Pradel","author_inst":"Fondation Merieux , France"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Escuret","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Virologie, Institut des Agents Infectieux, Hopital de la Croix Rousse, Hospices Civils de Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Cedric Dananche","author_inst":"Laboratoire des Pathogenes Emergents, Fondation Merieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111, CNRS, Lyon, France AND Service"},{"author_name":"Christelle Elias","author_inst":"Laboratoire des Pathogenes Emergents, Fondation Merieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111, CNRS, Lyon, France AND Service"},{"author_name":"Hubert Endtz","author_inst":"Fondation Merieux, France"},{"author_name":"Philippe Vanhems","author_inst":"Laboratoire des Pathogenes Emergents, Fondation Merieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111, CNRS, Lyon, France AND Service"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20057638","rel_title":"Purely data-driven exploration of COVID-19 pandemic after three months of the outbreak","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20057638","rel_abs":"It has been three months since the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak.

Recent studies suggest that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could be effective against COVID-19. It is reasonable to expect that if HCQ can prevent or reduce the adverse effects of influenza, it may also reduce the effects of COVID-19 in humans. The objective of this study was to test whether HCQ can prevent or reduce the risk and severity of influenza. Methods. This is an observational cohort study using medico-administrative data from Quebec. Patients included had at least one emergency department (ED) visit in 2012 or 2013, with a prior diagnosis of chronic conditions, and were admissible to the public drug insurance plan. Two sub-cohorts were considered depending on reasons for ED visit: other than influenza or pneumonia (primary prevention) and influenza or pneumonia (secondary prevention). Results. In the primary prevention analysis (n=417,353), patients taking HCQ (n=3,659) had an increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia in the following year compared to those who did not (5.2% vs. 2.9%; adjusted OR=1.25, p=0.0079). In the secondary prevention analysis (n=27,152), patients taking HCQ (n=392), compared to those who did not had a modest and non-significant increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia after 30 days (25.8% vs. 22.6%; adjusted OR=1.14, p=0.3177). Interpretation: Based on the assumption that HCQ has similar effects on the COVID-19 as those observed on influenza, we can infer that it will not have positive effects on COVID-19. We should therefore act cautiously before initiating prospective interventional studies on the use of HCQ to reduce adverse effects of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alain Vanasse","author_inst":"Department of family medicine and emergency medicine, Universite de Sherbrooke"},{"author_name":"Josiane

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on all suspected pediatric cases. Results: 39 (50.6%) of 77 suspected cases were comfirmed, 4 (5.2%) of them had viral coinfection.Compared with non-COVID-19 group (n=33),COVID-19 confirmed group (n=39) had fewer fever(OR[95% CI]0.467[0.314 to 0.694];P=.000) and symptoms of acute respiratory infection (0.533[0.36 to 0.788];P=.001),more asymptomatic (13.568[1.895 to 96.729];P=.000),and more family cluster infections (5.077[2.224 to 11.591];P=.000),while computed tomography had more positive findings of viral pneumonia (1.822[1.143 to 2.906];P=.008).Age(6.9[3.6 to 10.5] vs 5[2.1 to 7.6];P=.088) and gender were statistically insignificant.Procalcitonin (0.05[0.029 to 0.076] vs 0.103[0.053 to 0.21];P=.000) of COVID-19 alone group (n=35) was significantly reduced.While compared with coinfection group (n=4),procalcitonin (0.05[0.029 to 0.076] vs 0.144[0.109 to 2.26];P=.010) was also reduced.The area under curve of model is 0.834 ([95%CI][0.741 to 0.926];P=.000).Procalcitonin as a differential indicator of COVID-19 alone,its area under curve is 0.809 ([0.710 to 0.909];P=.000). The optimal cut-off value is 0.1 ng\/mL,the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of differentiating are 65.9%, 78.6%, 82.9%, and 59.2%,respectively. Conclusions: Asymptoms or mild symptoms,positive computed tomography findings and family cluster infection are the main clinical features of COVID-19 in children.With good performance, procalcitonin can provide an important basis for differentiating COVID-19 alone and other viral infection or viral coinfection.

Italy, the Western country with most COVID-19 related deaths, was the first to implement drastic containment measures in early March, 2020. Since then most other European countries, the USA, Canada and Australia, have implemented similar restrictions, ranging from school closures, banning of recreational activities and large events, to complete lockdown. Such limitations, and softer promotion of social distancing, may be more effective in one society than in another due to cultural or political differences. It is therefore important to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives by analyzing country-specific COVID-19 data. We propose to model COVID-19 dynamics with a SIQR (susceptible - infectious - quarantined - recovered) model, since confirmed positive cases are isolated and do not transmit the disease. We provide an explicit formula that is easily implemented and permits us to fit official COVID-19 data in a series of Western countries. We found excellent agreement with data-driven estimation of the day-of-change in disease dynamics and the dates when official interventions were introduced. Our analysis predicts that for most countries only the more drastic restrictions have reduced virus spreading. Further, we predict that the number of unidentified COVID-19-positive individuals at the beginning of the epidemic is [~]10 times the number of confirmed cases. Our results provide important insight for future planning of non-pharmacological interventions aiming to contain spreading of COVID-19 and similar diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Morten Gram Pedersen","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Padova"},{"author_name":"Matteo Meneghini","author_inst":"University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Sachin Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Liu","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Pengyao Wu","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Haidong Kan","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Weibing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Hubert Endtz","author_inst":"Fondation Merieux, France"},{"author_name":"Philippe Vanhems","author_inst":"Laboratoire des Pathogenes Emergents, Fondation Merieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111, CNRS, Lyon, France AND Service"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.031963","rel_title":"BioLaboro: A bioinformatics system for detecting molecular assay signature erosion and designing new assays in response to emerging and reemerging pathogens","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.031963","rel_abs":"BackgroundEmerging and reemerging infectious diseases such as the novel Coronavirus disease, COVID-19 and Ebola pose a significant threat to global society and test the public health communitys preparedness to rapidly respond to an outbreak with effective diagnostics and therapeutics. Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable rapid generation of pathogen genome sequence data, within 24 hours of obtaining a sample in some instances. With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned or newly designed assays.\n\nResultsHere we describe a bioinformatics system named BioLaboro to identify signature regions in a given pathogen genome, design PCR assays targeting those regions, and then test the PCR assays in silico to determine their sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate BioLaboro with two use cases: Bombali Ebolavirus (BOMV) and the novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). For the BOMV, we analyzed 30 currently available real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays against the three available complete genome sequences of BOMV. Only two met our in silico criteria for successful detection and neither had perfect matches to the primer\/probe sequences. We designed five new primer sets against BOMV signatures and all had true positive hits to the three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other sequence. Four assays are closely clustered in the nucleoprotein gene and one is located in the glycoprotein gene. Similarly, for the SARS-CoV-2, we designed five highly specific primer sets that hit all 145 whole genomes (available as of February 28, 2020) and none of the near neighbors.\n\nConclusionsHere we applied BioLaboro in two real-world use cases to demonstrate its capability; 1) to identify signature regions, 2) to assess the efficacy of existing PCR assays to detect pathogens as they evolve over time, and 3) to design new assays with perfect in silico detection accuracy, all within hours, for further development and deployment. BioLaboro is designed with a user-friendly graphical user interface for biologists with limited bioinformatics experience.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mitchell Holland","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Daniel Negron","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Shane Mitchell","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Nate Dellinger","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Mychal Ivancich","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Tyler Barrus","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Sterling Thomas","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Katharine W Jennings","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Bruce G Goodwin","author_inst":"DBPAO, CBRND-EB, JPEO"},{"author_name":"Shanmuga Sozhamannan","author_inst":"CBRND-Enabling Biotechnologies, JPEO"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"}]}
