Like other respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, the virus remains only about two months in any given population, yet the peak incidence and the lethality can vary. The data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, and Italy were hit by the more dangerous \"SKII\" variant. While the epidemic in China is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the course of the epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing and the peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the US first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies. While containment merely prolongs the time the disease circulates until the proportion of immune people is high enough for \"herd immunity\", reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Knut M.

As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus. | Methods: We adopted the Huike database to extract news articles about coronavirus from major press media, between January 1st, 2020, to February 20th, 2020. The data were sorted and analyzed by Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number using the coherence number. We operated Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling with the suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into two-dimensional plane via multidimensional scaling. | Findings: After removing duplicates, 7791 relevant news reports were identified. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as our number of topics and obtained their names and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, global\/local social\/economic influences, accounting for 32.6%, 16.6%, 11.8% of the collected reports respectively. | Interpretation: The Chinese mass media news reports lag behind the COVID-19 outbreak development. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a global issue, and society has also become concerned about donation and support as well as mental health. We recommend that future work should address the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qian Liu","author_inst":"School of Journalism and Communication, National Media Experimental Teaching Demonstration Center, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Communicati"},{"author_name":"Zequan Zheng","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China; Faculty of Medicine, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jiabin Zheng","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China; Faculty of Medicine, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Qiuyi Chen","author_inst":"School of Journalism and Communication, National Media Experimental Teaching Demonstration Center, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guan Liu","author_inst":"Faculty of Computer Centre, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Sihan Chen","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Bojia Chu","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Hongyu Zhu","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Babatunde Akinwunmi","author_inst":"Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, Massachuset"},{"author_name":"Jian Huang","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, St Mary's Campus, Imperial College London, Norfolk"},{"author_name":"Casper J.

Objectives: Assessing the spread of the COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and precipitation. Methods: Open-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25{degrees} latitude\/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios. Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single case in 113\/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from -28.0 to 30.1 {degrees}C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4 to 23.0 {degrees}C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm-2 and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence. Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Byass","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Zequan Zheng","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China; Faculty of Medicine, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jiabin Zheng","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China; Faculty of Medicine, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Qiuyi Chen","author_inst":"School of Journalism and Communication, National Media Experimental Teaching Demonstration Center, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guan Liu","author_inst":"Faculty of Computer Centre, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Sihan Chen","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Bojia Chu","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Hongyu Zhu","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Babatunde Akinwunmi","author_inst":"Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, Massachuset"},{"author_name":"Jian Huang","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, St Mary's Campus, Imperial College London, Norfolk"},{"author_name":"Casper J.

Further, there remain countries in the early phase of outbreak with zero or limited number of cases in southern hemisphere countries. In those countries at risk of future outbreak, ascertaining whether cases are imported or the result of local secondary transmission is important for government to shape appropriate public health strategies. Objective: To develop a method to estimate timing of infection establishment, which helps differentiate imported and autochthonous cases. Design, Setting and Participants: Of the first 18 cases reported in Singapore, 12 were used in our study (1 case with insufficient data and 5 on anti-viral treatment were excluded from the analysis). The viral load data from these initial cases considered imported due to their travel history to Wuhan were analyzed. Another viral load data from 3 cases reported from Zhuhai, China, for whom exposed day were known, were also analyzed to determine the viral load threshold for infection establishment. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test. Main Outcomes and Measures: The timing of infection establishment of each case was assessed by analysing viral load data after symptom onset using a within-host viral dynamics model for SARS-CoV-2. Estimated timing of infection will indicate whether cases are imported or autochthonous transmission within Singapore. Results: Six among the 12 cases were clearly imported cases, whereas we could not rule out the possibility of secondary transmission for the rest of 6 cases, which collectively evidenced ongoing transmission in Singapore. For the 6 cases who could be the results of secondary transmission, further investigation to identify the source of infection within Singapore should be warranted (i.e., contact tracing).

Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The rise in fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise in death cases should be proportional to the rise in virus infections. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of deaths were analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that basic epidemiological parameters differ between countries to an extent compromising epidemiological predictions of the pandemic. It also suggests that suppression of spread in Italy and the US may be more difficult to achieve. Although we assume that variations in social behaviour are responsible for the different estimates of R0, selection of more rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Despite uncertainty in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a working hypothesis demanding further investigations. As the number of deaths rapidly increases worldwide, we encourage more sophisticated modelling of the epidemic based on the dynamics of death cases by experts in the field.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Armin Ensser","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg FAU"},{"author_name":"Klaus Ueberla","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg FAU"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Ito","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shoya Iwanami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Ohashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Koizumi","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Koichi Watashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Ana I Bento","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Casper J.

Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario. Materials & Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID- 19. The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set) ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray images. The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19. Conclusion : The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital images of the chest X- rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for the health professionals.

Through careful inspection of the spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) from six cases with postmortem examinations, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect secondary lymphoid organs to induce cell death. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expresses on tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages in spleens and LNs. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) can be found in ACE2+ cells, CD169+ macrophages, but not in CD3+ T cells or B220+ B cells in spleens and LNs. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe tissue damage including lymph follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions. Moreover, in situ TUNEL staining illustrated that viral infection leads to severe lymphocyte apoptosis, which might be mediated by viral antigens inducing Fas upregulation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 also triggers macrophages to produce IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine that directly promotes lymphocyte necrosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 directly neutralizes human spleens and LNs through infecting tissue- resident CD169+ macrophages.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"yongwen chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Zeqing Feng","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Diao","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Rongshuai Wang","author_inst":"Hubei Chongxin Judicial Expertise Center, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Gang Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Chenhui Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingjun Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 13 Hangkong Road, Wuhan,  China"},{"author_name":"Changsong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, 989th Hospital of PLA, Luoyang, China"},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yueping Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Zilin Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Ren","author_inst":"Hubei Chongxin Judicial Expertise Center, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20045740","rel_title":"A Territory-wide study of COVID-19 cases and clusters with unknown source in Hong Kong community: A clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic investigation","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20045740","rel_abs":"Background: Initial cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported in Hong Kong were mostly imported cases from Mainland China. However, most cases reported in February 2020 were local infections with unknown source, indicating local community transmissions. This study aimed to report the clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic characteristics of the local cases of COVID-19 in our community. Methods: We extracted the demographic, clinical and epidemiological data from 50 COVID-19 patients, who accounted for 53.8% of the cases in Hong Kong by the end of February 2020. We used both Nanopore and Illumina platforms to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from these patients. Phylogenetic relatedness among these local cases and their placement in the global phylogeny were examined. The evolutionary rate and divergence time of transmission were also determined. Findings: Of these 50 patients, only three (6.0%) had visited Wuhan while 43 (86.0%) did not have recent travel records. The average interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8.5 days. The most common signs and symptoms on admission were cough (74.0%) and fever (58.0%). Radiographic abnormality was found in 46 (92.0%) patients. Three (6.0%) patients required ICU admission. Phylogenetic analysis concurred with epidemiological investigation that 42 (84.0%) cases could be grouped into six transmission clusters. Forty-four (88.0%) cases harboured a common mutation Orf3a G251V. Global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that most (88.0%) cases in Hong Kong were clustered in two subclades with the strains from other countries. The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of COVID-2019 outbreak in Hong Kong was December 24, 2019 with an evolutionary rate of 3.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year. The reproduction number value was 1.84 as of February 28, 2020 in Hong Kong. Interpretation: We provided a territory-wide overview of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, which has borders connecting to Mainland China. Transmission in closed settings especially during family and religious gatherings is a hallmark of the recently reported cases. The reproduction number value indicated an ongoing outbreak in the community. Social distancing and vigilant epidemiological control are crucial to the containment of COVID-19 transmission","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth Siu-Sing Leung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Timothy Ting-Leung Ng","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Alan Ka-Lun Wu","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miranda Chong-Yee Yau","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hiu-Yin Lao","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Pan Choi","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Kingsley King-Gee Tam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lam-Kwong Lee","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Barry Kin-Chung Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alex Yat-Man Ho","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kam-Tong Yip","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Cheung Lung","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raymond Wai-To Liu","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eugene Yuk-Keung Tso","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wai-Shing Leung","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Man-Chun Chan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuk-Yung Ng","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20044339","rel_title":"Estimating the size of COVID-19 epidemic outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20044339","rel_abs":"In this work, we analyze the epidemic data of cumulative infected cases collected from many countries as reported by WHO starting from January 21st,2020 and up till March 21st,2020. Our inspection is motivated by the renormalization group (RG) framework. Here we propose the RG-inspired logistic function of the form E(t) = a(1 + ec(t-t0))-n as an epidemic strength function with n being asymmetry in the modified logistic function. We perform the non-linear least-squares analysis with data from various countries. The uncertainty for model parameters is computed using the squared root of the corresponding diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We carefully divide countries under consideration into 2 categories based on the estimation of the inflection point: the maturing phase and the growth-dominated phase. We observe that long-term estimations of cumulative infected cases of countries in the maturing phase for both n=1 and n= 1 are close to each other. We find from the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) that the RG-inspired logistic model with n= 1 is slightly preferable in this category. We also argue that n determines the characteristic of the epidemic at an early stage. However, in the second category, the estimated asymptotic number of cumulative infected cases contain rather large uncertainty. Therefore, in the growth-dominated phase, we focus on using n= 1 for countries in this phase. Some of them are in an early stage of an epidemic with an insufficient amount of data leading to a large uncertainty on parameter fits. In terms of the accuracy of the size estimation, the results do strongly depend on limitations on data collection and the epidemic phase for each country.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chakrit Pongkitivanichkul","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Daris Samart","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Takol Tangphati","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Phanit Koomhin","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160"},{"author_name":"Pimchanok Pimton","author_inst":"School of Science, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Punsiri Dam-O","author_inst":"School of Science, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Apirak Payaka","author_inst":"College of Graduate Studies, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Phongpichit Channuie","author_inst":"College of Graduate Studies, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Barry Kin-Chung Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alex Yat-Man Ho","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kam-Tong Yip","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Cheung Lung","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raymond Wai-To Liu","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eugene Yuk-Keung Tso","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wai-Shing Leung","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Man-Chun Chan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuk-Yung Ng","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.20046706","rel_title":"No Evidence for Temperature-Dependence of the COVID-19 Epidemic","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.20046706","rel_abs":"The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease extended from China across the north-temperate zone, and more recently to the tropics and southern hemisphere.

Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joan C Smith","author_inst":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Erin L.

Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31-mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compared with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS-CoV-2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS-CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type (-53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild-type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding. Due to the urgent situation created by COVID-19, we share these computational data to the community, which should be helpful to develop potential antiviral peptide drugs to combat this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Huang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robin Pearce","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Monet Lou Yuan","author_inst":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Kristen M.

Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses - the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 - exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000), and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009). Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins. The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again.\n\nIn BriefThe Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows frequent recombination in its evolutionary history. We characterize the extent of this genetic exchange and identify non-recombining regions of the sarbecovirus genome using three independent methods to remove the effects of recombination. Using these non-recombining genome regions and prior information on coronavirus evolutionary rates, we obtain estimates from three approaches that the most likely divergence date of SARS-CoV-2 from its most closely related available bat sequences ranges from 1948 to 1982.\n\nKey PointsO_LIRaTG13 is the closest available bat virus to SARS-CoV-2; a sub-lineage of these bat viruses is able to infect humans. Two sister lineages of the RaTG13\/SARS-CoV-2 lineage infect Malayan pangolins.\nC_LIO_LIThe sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events, indicating that there are high levels of co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and substantial genetic diversity; the sarbecoviruses are efficient  explorers of phenotype space.\nC_LIO_LIThe SARS-CoV-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant, at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin viruses sampled to date.\nC_LIO_LINon-recombinant regions of the sarbecoviruses can be identified, allowing for phylogenetic inference and dating to be performed. We constructed three such regions using different methods.\nC_LIO_LIWe estimate that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 diverged 40 to 70 years ago. There is a diverse unsampled reservoir of generalist viruses established in horseshoe bats.\nC_LIO_LIWhile an intermediate host responsible for the zoonotic event cannot be ruled out, the relevant evolution for spillover to humans very likely occurred in horseshoe bats.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maciej F Boni","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lemey","author_inst":"Katholieke University, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Tommy Tsan-Yuk Lam","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Blair Perry","author_inst":"Department of Biology, University of Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Todd Castoe","author_inst":"Department of Biology, University of Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rambaut","author_inst":"Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"David L Robertson","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, UK"},{"author_name":"Phongpichit Channuie","author_inst":"College of Graduate Studies, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Barry Kin-Chung Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alex Yat-Man Ho","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kam-Tong Yip","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Cheung Lung","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raymond Wai-To Liu","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eugene Yuk-Keung Tso","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wai-Shing Leung","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Man-Chun Chan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuk-Yung Ng","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.008631","rel_title":"Azithromycin and ciprofloxacin have a chloroquine-like effect on respiratory epithelial cells","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.008631","rel_abs":"There is interest in the use of chloroquine\/hydroxychloroquine (CQ\/HCQ) and azithromycin (AZT) in COVID-19 therapy.

The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein unique features have been associated with efficient viral spread in the human population. Phylogeny-based and genetic algorithm methods clearly show that recombination events between viral progenitors infecting animal hosts led to a mosaic structure in the S gene. We identified recombination coldspots in the S glycoprotein and strong purifying selection. Moreover, although there is little evidence of diversifying positive selection during host-switching, structural analysis suggests that some of the residues emerged along the ancestral lineage of current pandemic strains may contribute to enhanced ability to infect human cells. Interestingly, recombination did not affect the long-range covariant movements of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer in pre-fusion conformation but, on the contrary, could contribute to the observed overall viral efficiency. Our dynamic simulations revealed that the movements between the host cell receptor binding domain (RBD) and the novel furin-like cleavage site are correlated. We identified threonine 333 (under purifying selection), at the beginning of the RBD, as the hinge of the opening\/closing mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer functional to hACE2 binding. Our findings support a scenario where ancestral recombination and fixation of amino acid residues in the RBD of the S glycoprotein generated a virus with unique features, capable of extremely efficient infection of the human host.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Massimiliano S Tagliamonte","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Nabil Adid","author_inst":"High Institute of Biotechnology Sidi Thabet"},{"author_name":"David A Ostrov","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Chillemi","author_inst":"Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-food and Forest systems"},{"author_name":"Sergei  L Kosakovsky Pond","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Marco Salemi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Carla N Mavian","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Delli Ponti","author_inst":"University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gian Gaetano Tartaglia","author_inst":"University of Rome Sapienza and Italian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rei-Lin Kuo","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Tsan Liu","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Ji-Rong Yang","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hsun Chiu","author_inst":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Ta Yang","author_inst":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Guang-Wu Chen","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Yuk-Yung Ng","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.015644","rel_title":"Atlas of ACE2 gene expression in mammals reveals novel insights in transmission of SARS-Cov-2","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.015644","rel_abs":"BackgroundCOVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic. It is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 with elusive origin. SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans. In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels.\n\nResultsWe first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined. Notably, high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans.\n\nConclusionsThrough building the first atlas of ACE2 expression in pets and livestock, we identified species and tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding novel insights into the viral transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kun Sun","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Liuqi Gu","author_inst":"Beijing Huayuan Academy of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Li Ma","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Duan","author_inst":"Beijing Huayuan Academy of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sergei  L Kosakovsky Pond","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Marco Salemi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Carla N Mavian","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Delli Ponti","author_inst":"University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gian Gaetano Tartaglia","author_inst":"University of Rome Sapienza and Italian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rei-Lin Kuo","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Tsan Liu","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Ji-Rong Yang","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hsun Chiu","author_inst":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Ta Yang","author_inst":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Guang-Wu Chen","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Yuk-Yung Ng","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.013490","rel_title":"Lectin-like Intestinal Defensin Inhibits 2019-nCoV Spike binding to ACE2","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.013490","rel_abs":"The burgeoning epidemic caused by novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) is currently a global concern. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a receptor of 2019-nCoV spike 1 protein (S1) and mediates viral entry into host cells. Despite the abundance of ACE2 in small intestine, few digestive symptoms are observed in patients infected by 2019-nCoV. Herein, we investigated the interactions between ACE2 and human defensins (HDs) specifically secreted by intestinal Paneth cells. The lectin-like HD5, rather than HD6, bound ACE2 with a high affinity of 39.3 nM and weakened the subsequent recruitment of 2019-nCoV S1. The cloak of HD5 on the ligand-binding domain of ACE2 was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation. A remarkable dose-dependent preventive effect of HD5 on 2019-nCoV S1 binding to intestinal epithelial cells was further evidenced by in vitro experiments. Our findings unmasked the innate defense function of lectin-like intestinal defensin against 2019-nCoV, which may provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cheng Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Shaobo Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daixi Li","author_inst":"Institute of Biothermal Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xia Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Songling Han","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Tao Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Gaomei Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Yin Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Jianqi Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Liting Wang","author_inst":"Biomedical Analysis Center, Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Sun","author_inst":"Biomedical Analysis Center, Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Huang","author_inst":"Biomedical Analysis Center, Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yongping Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Dongqing Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Shanghai-Islamabad-Belgrade Joint Innovation Center on Antibacterial Resistances, Joint Laboratory of Internationa"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junping Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.015347","rel_title":"Susceptibility of ferrets, cats, dogs, and different domestic animals to SARS-coronavirus-2","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.015347","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the infectious disease COVID-19, which was first reported in Wuhan, China in December, 2019.

We describe here the development of a phage-displayed single-domain antibody library by grafting naive CDRs into framework regions of an identified human germline IGHV allele. This enabled the isolation of high-affinity single-domain antibodies of fully human origin. The panning using SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 as antigens resulted in the identification of antibodies targeting five types of neutralizing or non-neutralizing epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These fully human single-domain antibodies bound specifically to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities. Some of them were found to potently neutralize pseudotyped and live virus, and therefore may represent promising candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-19. This study also reports unique immunogenic profile of SARS-CoV-2 RBD compared to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which may have important implications for the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yanling Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Li","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shuai Xia","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaolong Tian","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhi Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yu Kong","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenjian Gu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chao Tu","author_inst":"Biomissile Corporation"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tianlei Ying","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yongping Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Dongqing Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Shanghai-Islamabad-Belgrade Joint Innovation Center on Antibacterial Resistances, Joint Laboratory of Internationa"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junping Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.014381","rel_title":"Computational Prediction of the Comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. Human Interactome to Guide the Design of Therapeutics","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.014381","rel_abs":"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWUnderstanding the disease pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, denoted SARS-CoV-2, is critical to the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID-19 (\"coronavirus disease 2019\"), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. Given the known interaction between the human ACE2 (\"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\") protein and the SARS-CoV virus (responsible for the coronavirus outbreak circa. 2003), considerable focus has been directed towards the putative interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2. However, a more holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises additional putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics.\n\nTo that end, we leverage two state-of-the-art, sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 & SPRINT) capable of generating the comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. human interactome, comprising approximately 285,000 pairwise predictions. Of these, we identify the high-scoring subset of human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by both methods, comprising 279 high-confidence putative interactions involving 225 human proteins. Notably, the Spike-ACE2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the PIPE4 and SPRINT predictors, corroborating existing evidence for this PPI. Furthermore, the PIPE-Sites algorithm was used to predict the putative subsequence that might mediate each interaction and thereby inform the design of inhibitory polypeptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host-pathogen interactions.\n\nWe hereby publicly release the comprehensive set of PPI predictions and their corresponding PIPE-Sites landscapes in the following DataVerse repository: 10.5683\/SP2\/JZ77XA.

This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide\/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus. Our analysis identified the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimization and suggests a roadmap for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, which can be generalizable to other viruses.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacob Kames","author_inst":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"David Dillon Holcomb","author_inst":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Ofer Kimchi","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Michael DiCuccio","author_inst":"National Center of Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Nobuko Hamasaki-Katagiri","author_inst":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Tony Wang","author_inst":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Anton A Komar","author_inst":"Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, Cleveland State University"},{"author_name":"Aikaterini Alexaki","author_inst":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Chava Kimchi-Sarfaty","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tianlei Ying","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yongping Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Dongqing Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Shanghai-Islamabad-Belgrade Joint Innovation Center on Antibacterial Resistances, Joint Laboratory of Internationa"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junping Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Combined Injury of PLA, Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine, College "},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"}]}
