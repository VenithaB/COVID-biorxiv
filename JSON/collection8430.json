Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used because of its high sensitivity, typically claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by some RT-PCR methods, probably due to low viral load, timing of sampling, degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or possible mutations spanning the primer binding sites. Therefore, alternative and highly sensitive methods are imperative. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodating various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 343 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrated its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allowed for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. We further amplified the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome from 8 to half a million viral copies purified from 13 COVID-19 positive specimens, and detected mutations through next generation sequencing. Finally, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method in parallel, that required modest sequencing depth for uncovering SARS-CoV-2 mutational diversity and potentially novel or emerging isolates.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chenyu Li","author_inst":"Paragon Genomics Inc., Hayward, CA 94545 USA"},{"author_name":"David N.

The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as SARS-CoV, can reveal the common and\/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system.\n\nHerein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind\/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells.\n\nThe data, sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Filippo Marchetti","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Colombo","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Chong Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Jiayi Liu","author_inst":"Bejing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University."},{"author_name":"Jing Xue","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Qi Lv","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Jiangning Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Pin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Yanfeng Xu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Feifei Qi","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Yajin Qu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Fengdi Li","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Zhiguang Xiang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Haisheng Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Shuran Gong","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Mingya Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Guanpeng Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Shunyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Zhiqi Song","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Yunlin Han","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Linna Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Xing Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Qiang Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.12.988865","rel_title":"The architecture of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome","rel_date":"2020-03-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.12.988865","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and\/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3' tail.

There is no cure for COVID-19 and the vaccine development is estimated to require 12-18 months. Here we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) genome in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened a group of CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs for cleaving SARS-CoV-2. The approach is effective in reducing respiratory cell viral replication for H1N1 IAV. Our bioinformatic analysis showed a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. The PAC-MAN approach is potentially a rapidly implementable pan-coronavirus strategy to deal with emerging pandemic strains.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy R Abbott","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Girija Dhamdhere","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Liu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Xueqiu Lin","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Laine E Goudy","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Leiping Zeng","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Augustine Chemparathy","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Chmura","author_inst":"DNARx Inc"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Heaton","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Robert Debs","author_inst":"DNARx INC"},{"author_name":"Tara Pande","author_inst":"Los Altos High School"},{"author_name":"Drew Endy","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Marie La Russa","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David B Lewis","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Lei S Qi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Shuran Gong","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Mingya Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Guanpeng Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Shunyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Zhiqi Song","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Yunlin Han","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Linna Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Xing Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Qiang Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.14.988345","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells via a novel route: CD147-spike protein","rel_date":"2020-03-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.14.988345","rel_abs":"Currently, COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely spread around the world; nevertheless, so far there exist no specific antiviral drugs for treatment of the disease, which poses great challenge to control and contain the virus.

SP bound to CD147, a receptor on the host cells, thereby mediating the viral invasion. Our further research confirmed this finding. First, in vitro antiviral tests indicated Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 humanized antibody, significantly inhibited the viruses from invading host cells, with an EC50 of 24.86 g\/mL and IC50 of 15.16 g\/mL. Second, we validated the interaction between CD147 and SP, with an affinity constant of 1.85x10-7M. Co-Immunoprecipitation and ELISA also confirmed the binding of the two proteins. Finally, the localization of CD147 and SP was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells by immuno-electron microscope. Therefore, the discovery of the new route CD147-SP for SARS-CoV-2 invading host cells provides a critical target for development of specific antiviral drugs.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ke Wang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Sen Zhou","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jian-Qi Lian","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Du","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Li Gong","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong-Yong Cui","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie-Jie Geng","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Bin Wang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiu-Xuan Sun","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun-Fu Wang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xu Yang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Lin","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong-Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Ding Wei","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Min Yang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Meng Zhu","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kui Zhang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhao-Hui Zheng","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Lin Miao","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ting Guo","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ying Shi","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Ling Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing-Yi Wang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huijie Bian","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Zhu","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Nan Chen","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.12.989186","rel_title":"Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV Polymerase","rel_date":"2020-03-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.12.989186","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency.1 Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir\/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.2 Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV\/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3-fluoro-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingyue Ju","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxu Li","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Shiv Kumar","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Steffen Jockusch","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Minchen Chien","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Chuanjuan Tao","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Irina Morozova","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sergey Kalachikov","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Robert Kirchdoerfer","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"James J.

More than 9,00,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 47,000 COVID-19-associated mortalities have been reported worldwide till the writing of this article, and these numbers are increasing every passing hour. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 spread as a global public health emergency and admitted that the COVID-19 is a pandemic now. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied Human SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing less intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). However, IDPRs found in SARS-CoV-2 proteins are functionally important. For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins were shown to contain molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with specific partners. The results of our extensive investigation of the dark side of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome will have important implications for the structural and non-structural biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.\n\nSignificanceThe infection caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe respiratory disease with pneumonia-like symptoms in humans is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. No in-depth information on structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is currently available in the public domain, and no effective anti-viral drugs and\/or vaccines are designed for the treatment of this infection. Our study provides the first comparative analysis of the order- and disorder-based features of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome relative to human SARS and bat CoV that may be useful for structure-based drug discovery.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajanish Giri","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Taniya Bhardwaj","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Meenakshi Shegane","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Bhuvaneshwari R Gehi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Prateek Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Kundlik Gadhave","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

In this paper, a novel stochastic model is proposed which aims to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. We find that, (1) instead of aberration, there is a remarkable amount of asymptomatic individuals, (2) an individual with symptoms is approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic patient, (3) the transmission rate has reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in Mainland China, (4) it is expected that the epidemic outbreak would

decreased rate of severe\/critical type, increased liver\/kidney damage and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity during virus dissemination, when compared with Wuhan. To investigate the underlining mechanism, we isolated one strain of SARS- CoV-2 (ZJ01) in mild COVID-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C\/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 were both T at these two sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuan Zhang","author_inst":"Peking university"},{"author_name":"Chong You","author_inst":"Peking university"},{"author_name":"Zhenghao Cai","author_inst":"Peking university"},{"author_name":"Jiarui Sun","author_inst":"Peking university"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Hu","author_inst":"Peking university"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Peking university"},{"author_name":"Shuran Gong","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jiayi Liu","author_inst":"Department of radiology, Bejing Anzhen hospital, Capital medical university,  Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Jiangning Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Pin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Feifei Qi","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yanfeng Xu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fengli Li","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chong Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qi Lv","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jing Xue","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Mingya Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Guanpeng Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Shunyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Haisheng Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xing Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College,"},{"author_name":"Yunlin Han","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ling Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing-Yi Wang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huijie Bian","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Zhu","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Nan Chen","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.11.20034215","rel_title":"Estimation of instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei based on daily case notification data","rel_date":"2020-03-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.11.20034215","rel_abs":"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initially appeared and has most rapidly spread in Wuhan, China. The case fatality rate is the most direct indicator to assess the hazards of an infectious disease. We aimed to estimate the instant fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province. Methods We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 from Dec 8, 2019 to Mar 10, 2020 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province officially announced by the Chinese authority. The numbers of daily confirmed\/deaths\/cured cases and the numbers of daily cumulative confirmed\/deaths\/cured cases were obtained. The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were obtained on the basis of the median death or medium cure time, respectively. Finally, the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was calculated according to the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates. Results From Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020 in Wuhan City, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.4%19.5% and the instant cured rate was 80.0%96.6%. The average fatality rate reached 11.4% while the average cure rate was 88.6%. During the same period in Hubei Province, the instant case fatality rate was 3.8%16.6% and the instant cured rate was 83.4%96.6%. The average fatality rate and the average cure rate were 9.2% and 91.8%, respectively. Conclusions The fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province were underestimated. Wuhan showed higher fatality rate and cure rate than the whole Hubei Province did.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Cao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Ting-ting Huang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jun-xia Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Qi Qin","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Si-yu Liu","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Hui-min Xue","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Ya-xin Gong","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Chang-hua Ning","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-tong Shen","author_inst":"Xian Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jia-xin Yang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yan-ni Mi","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xue Xiao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yongxiao Cao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Chong Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qi Lv","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jing Xue","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Mingya Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Guanpeng Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Shunyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Haisheng Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xing Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College,"},{"author_name":"Yunlin Han","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ling Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing-Yi Wang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huijie Bian","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Zhu","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Nan Chen","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.10.20033761","rel_title":"Inferring the number of COVID-19 cases from recently reported deaths","rel_date":"2020-03-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.10.20033761","rel_abs":"We estimate the number of COVID-19 cases from newly reported deaths in a population without previous reports.

Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1,24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%,1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 or 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%,1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Verity","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lucy C Okell","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Winskill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Natsuko Imai","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Han Fu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Amy Dighe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jamie Griffin","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Anne Cori","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta Bhatia","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rich Fitzjohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Will Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arran Hamlet","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Sabine van-Elsand","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanrong Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiayoue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.09.20033415","rel_title":"The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects","rel_date":"2020-03-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.09.20033415","rel_abs":"Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Verity","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lucy C Okell","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Winskill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Natsuko Imai","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Han Fu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Amy Dighe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jamie Griffin","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Anne Cori","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta Bhatia","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rich Fitzjohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Will Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arran Hamlet","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Sabine van-Elsand","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanrong Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiayoue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.09.20033498","rel_title":"Modeling the situation of COVID-19 and effects of different containment strategies in China with dynamic differential equations and parameters estimation","rel_date":"2020-03-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.09.20033498","rel_abs":"This paper proposed a quarantine-susceptible-exposed-infectious-resistant (QSEIR) model which considers the unprecedented strict quarantine measures in almost the whole of China to resist the epidemic. We estimated model parameters from published information with the statistical method and stochastic simulation, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test result. The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. The sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can't be relaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiuli Liu","author_inst":"Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey J.D.

We managed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from Hubei and non-Hubei in China. Methods: We extracted data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the IFP of new cases in Hubei and non-Hubei on subsequent days and the data from Mar 6 to Mar 9 as validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the IFP of time (the rate of new increment reaches zero) could be predicted in South Korean, Italy, and Iran. Also, through this model, the global trend of the epidemic will be decoded to allocate international medical resources better and instruct the strategy for quarantine. Results: the optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of -3.87%), the relative pessimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of -2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of -1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China. Matching and fitting with these scenarios, the IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6-Mar 12, Italy Mar 10-Mar 24, and Iran is Mar 10-Mar 24. The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in South Korea, 209k in Italy, and 226k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. There should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the IFP will arrive earlier than our estimation. However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. If that happens, the IFP of increment will be higher than predicted above. Conclusion: We can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to manipulate the development of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhong Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Ke Wu","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;Department of Evidence-based medicine, Shan"},{"author_name":"Zhixian Yao","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Junhua Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of Evidence-based medicine, Sha"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"CreditWise Technology Company Limited, Chengdu, China; Caixin Insight Group, Beijing, China; MSCI, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Shan Zheng","author_inst":"Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xuefeng Li","author_inst":"Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hayley Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Han Fu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Amy Dighe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jamie Griffin","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Anne Cori","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta Bhatia","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rich Fitzjohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Will Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arran Hamlet","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Sabine van-Elsand","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanrong Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiayoue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.09.20033118","rel_title":"Epidemiological, Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Medical Staff Infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A Retrospective Case Series Analysis","rel_date":"2020-03-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.09.20033118","rel_abs":"Backgrounds Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus epidemic has emerged in Wuhan city, China and then rapidly spread to other areas. As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. Methods In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (<= 10 days) and group 2 (>10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. Findings The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%) as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission, 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), subpleural (80%) and ground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge. Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Smaller BMI, absence of fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on admission are favorable for discharge for medical staff. Further studies should be devoted to identifying the exact patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Liu Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Pi Guo","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Shantou University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hai sheng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Shantou University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Peng Fu","author_inst":"Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yu liang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Shantou University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Dan Yang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiao yu Han","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yu kun Cao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Osamah Alwalid","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Juan Tao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shu yi Peng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"He shui Shi","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fan Yang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chuan sheng Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rich Fitzjohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Will Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arran Hamlet","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Sabine van-Elsand","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanrong Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiayoue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.09.20033126","rel_title":"Clinical features of imported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in Tibetan patients in the Plateau area","rel_date":"2020-03-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.09.20033126","rel_abs":"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread throughout China, but the clinical characteristics of Tibetan patients living in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are unknown.

Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of these children was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5 Celsius). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4*109\/L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. One child had elevated serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reaction protein. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas persistent presence of viral RNA was found in stools of all children. One case had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 8 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 20 days. At the time of writing, one child still had positive results for RT-PCR analysis in stools after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory samples (over 19 days behind). Conclusions: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are very different from adult patients in regards to epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuhan Xing","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Ni","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guoju Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianning Tong","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiufeng Song","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quansheng Xing","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu kun Cao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Osamah Alwalid","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Juan Tao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shu yi Peng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"He shui Shi","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fan Yang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chuan sheng Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rich Fitzjohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Will Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arran Hamlet","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Sabine van-Elsand","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanrong Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiayoue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.09.20033142","rel_title":"Age specificity of cases and attack rate of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-03-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.09.20033142","rel_abs":"Age distribution of the cases with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rather different from that of influenza.

With few exceptions, genomic epidemiological analysis has focused on geographically distributed data sets with few isolates in any given location. Here we report an analysis of 20 whole SARS-CoV 2 genomes from a single relatively small and geographically constrained outbreak in Weifang, People's Republic of China. Using Bayesian model-based phylodynamic methods, we estimate the reproduction number for the outbreak to be 1.99(95% CI:1.48-3.14). We further estimate the number of infections through time and compare these estimates to confirmed diagnoses by the Weifang Centers for Disease Control. We find that these estimates are consistent with reported cases and there is unlikely to be a large undiagnosed burden of infection over the period we studied.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Han Fu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiauoyue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Weifang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Weifang 261061, China."},{"author_name":"Dehui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Weifang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Weifang 261061, China."},{"author_name":"Yingying Chen","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Weifang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Weifang 261061, China."},{"author_name":"Mengmeng Tian","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Weifang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Weifang 261061, China."},{"author_name":"Wei Tan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang 261061, China."},{"author_name":"Junjie Zai","author_inst":"Immunology Innovation Team, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China."},{"author_name":"Wanying Zan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Unknown Pathogen Identification, BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xinguang Li","author_inst":"Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan, 430415, China."},{"author_name":"Qing Nie","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Weifang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Weifang 261061, China."},{"author_name":"Chuan sheng Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rich Fitzjohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Will Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arran Hamlet","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Sabine van-Elsand","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanrong Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiayoue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.09.20033241","rel_title":"The demand for inpatient and ICU beds for COVID-19 in the US: lessons from Chinese cities","rel_date":"2020-03-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.09.20033241","rel_abs":"Background: Sustained spread of SARS-CoV-2 has happened in major US cities. Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources. Methods: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a US city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations. Conclusion: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system in US cities.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruoran Li","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p<0.05. Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%). Regarding COVID-19, most of the participants used social media to obtain information (61%), and a significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (61%) and symptom onset (63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19 prevention and control. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19. Conclusion: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs beyond borders, and further studies are warranted.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshaya Srikanth Bhagavathula","author_inst":"Ph.D student, Institute of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE"},{"author_name":"Wafa Ali Aldhaleei","author_inst":"Gastroenterology Fellow, Department of Gastroenterology, Sheikh Shakbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Jamal Rahmani","author_inst":"Ph.D student, Department of Community Nutrition, Faculty of Nutrition and Food Technology, National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Student Re"},{"author_name":"Mohammadjavad Ashrafi Mahabadi","author_inst":"Medical student, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kumar Bandari","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Vagdeevi College of Pharmacy, Warangal, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including South Korea.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Biao Tang","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Fan Xia","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Nicola Luigi Bragazzi","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Xia Wang","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Sha He","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Sun","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Sanyi Tang","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yanni Xiao","author_inst":"Xian Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Junjie Zai","author_inst":"Immunology Innovation Team, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China."},{"author_name":"Wanying Zan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Unknown Pathogen Identification, BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xinguang Li","author_inst":"Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan, 430415, China."},{"author_name":"Qing Nie","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Weifang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Weifang 261061, China."},{"author_name":"Chuan sheng Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rich Fitzjohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Will Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arran Hamlet","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Sabine van-Elsand","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanrong Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiayoue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.09.20033514","rel_title":"The time scale of asymptomatic transmission affects estimates of epidemic potential in the COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.09.20033514","rel_abs":"We assess the impact of asymptomatic transmission on epidemic potential of novel respiratory pathogens (like COVID-19) -- as measured both by the basic reproduction number (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R_0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R_0 will be under-estimated. We also show that as the length of asymptomatic generation intervals increase, estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase of the epidemic decrease. Our analysis provides a rationale for assessing the duration of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in addition to their prevalence in the population.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sang Woo Park","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Daniel M Cornforth","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Dushoff","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Joshua S Weitz","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sha He","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Sun","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Sanyi Tang","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yanni Xiao","author_inst":"Xian Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Junjie Zai","author_inst":"Immunology Innovation Team, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China."},{"author_name":"Wanying Zan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Unknown Pathogen Identification, BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xinguang Li","author_inst":"Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan, 430415, China."},{"author_name":"Qing Nie","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Weifang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Weifang 261061, China."},{"author_name":"Chuan sheng Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rich Fitzjohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Will Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arran Hamlet","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Sabine van-Elsand","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanrong Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiayoue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
