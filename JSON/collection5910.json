The epidemic has been mitigated by social distancing and the lockdown introduced on 17 and 23 March 2020 respectively. We recently reported a stochastic model of a mitigated epidemic which incorporated changes in social interactions and daily movements and whose simulations were consistent with the initial PHE daily mortality data. However, on 29 April, PHE revised their historic data to include out-of-hospital deaths in England. Out-of-hospital deaths occur sooner than in-hospital deaths. Here we show that if 20% of deaths, representing out-of-hospital deaths, are assigned a shorter illness period, then simulated daily mortality matches the revised PHE mortality at least until 4 May. We now predict that if the lockdown is gently relaxed in late May, whilst maintaining social distancing, there would be a modest second-wave which may be acceptable when weighed against the risks of maintaining the lockdown. Our model complements other more sophisticated work currently guiding national policy but which is not presently in the public domain.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony D Lander","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Thejasvi Subramanian","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital, Birmingham UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20091389","rel_title":"Evolution of COVID-19 pandemic: Power law growth and saturation","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20091389","rel_abs":"In this paper, we analyze the real-time infection data of COVID-19 epidemic for 21 nations up to June 30, 2020.

In particular, we find a universal {surd}t growth before they reach saturation. However, at present, India, which has I(t) ~ t2, and Russia and Brazil, which have I(t) [~] t, are yet to flatten their curves. Thus, the polynomials of the I(t) curves provide valuable information on the stage of the epidemic evolution, thus on the life cycle of COVID-19 pandemic. Besides these detailed analyses, we compare the predictions of an extended SEIR model and a delay differential equation-based model with the reported infection data and observed good agreement among them, including the {surd}t behaviour.

METHODS: Government websites from countries with minimum 1000 cases in adults and children on April 13, 2020 were searched to find the number of cases confirmed in children, the age range, and the number leading to hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. A systematic literature search was performed April 13, 2020 to find additional data from cases series. RESULTS: Data on pediatric cases were available from government websites for 23 of the 70 countries with minimum 1000 cases by April 13, 2020. Of 424 978 cases in these 23 countries, 8113 (1.9%) occurred in children. Nine publications provided data from 4251 cases in 4 additional countries. Combining data from the websites and the publications, 330 of 2361 cases required admission (14%). The ICU admission rate was 2.2 % of confirmed cases (44 of 2031) and 7.2% of admitted children (23 of 318). Death was reported for 15 cases. CONCLUSION: Children accounted for 1.9% of confirmed cases. The true incidence of pediatric infection and disease will only be known once testing is expanded to individuals with less severe or no symptoms. Admission rates vary from 0.3 to 10% of confirmed cases (presumably varying with the threshold for testing) with about 7% of admitted children requiring ICU care. Death is rare in middle and high income countries.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle Barton Forbes","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Kayur Mehta","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Kriti Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Jielin Lu","author_inst":"Schulich School of Medicine, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Nicole Le Saux","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Margaret Sampson","author_inst":"Library Services, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Joan Robinson","author_inst":"Stollery Childrens Hospital, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20091587","rel_title":"Acceptability of app-based contact tracing for COVID-19: Cross-country survey evidence","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20091587","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest public health crisis of the last 100 years. Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socio-economic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces close contacts of those infected with COVID- 19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing among the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app take-up, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. Methods We conducted a multi-country, large-scale (N = 5995) study to measure public support for digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs. automatic installation by mobile phone providers), and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. Results: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all sub-groups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We inves- tigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate take-up and found that concerns about cyber security and privacy, together with lack of trust in government, are the main barriers to adoption. Conclusions: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact-tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if take-up is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Altmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luke Milsom","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hannah Zillessen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Blasone","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Frederic Gerdon","author_inst":"University of Mannheim"},{"author_name":"Ruben Bach","author_inst":"University of Mannheim"},{"author_name":"Frauke Kreuter","author_inst":"University of Mannheim"},{"author_name":"Daniele Nosenzo","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Severine Toussaert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Johannes Abeler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089557","rel_title":"The Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on Liver Injury in China: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089557","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: The evidence for the incidence and severity of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19 is still controversial. Aims: The purpose of this study was to summarize the incidence of liver injury and the differences between liver injury markers among different patients with COVID-19 in China. Methods: Computer searches of PubMed, Embase, CNKI and medRxiv were used to obtain reports on the incidence and markers of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, from January 1, 2020 to April 10, 2020. (No. CRD42020181350) Results: A total of 57 reports from China were included, including 9889 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. The results of the meta-analysis showed that among the patients with early COVID-19 infection in China, the incidence of liver injury events was 24.7% (95% CI, 23.4%-26.4%). Liver injury in severe patients was more common than that in non-severe patients, with a risk ratio of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.77 to 2.43). Quantitative analysis showed that the severe the coronavirus infection, the higher the level of AST, ALT, TB, ALP, GGT and the lower the level of ALB. The changing trend of the appeal index was similar in ICU patients and dead patients. Conclusion: There is a certain risk of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, and the risk and degree of liver injury are related to the severity of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Zhao","author_inst":"1.

Potential therapies and means of prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulfate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulfate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. We performed a retrospective observational study to compare hospital outcomes among patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone. Methods: Data was collected from electronic medical records for all patients being treated with admission dates ranging from March 2, 2020 through April 5, 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. Patients in the study were excluded if they were treated with other investigational medications. Results: The addition of zinc sulfate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation, or ICU duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulfate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU, and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulfate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.09) reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice remained significant (OR 0.449, 95% CI 0.271-0.744). Conclusion: This study provides the first in vivo evidence that zinc sulfate in combination with hydroxychloroquine may play a role in therapeutic management for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip Carlucci","author_inst":"New York University Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Tania Ahuja","author_inst":"New York University Langone Health, Department of Pharmacy, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Petrilli","author_inst":"New York University Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Harish Rajagopalan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Division of Healthcare Delivery Science, Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Joseph Rahimian","author_inst":"NYU Langone"},{"author_name":"Frauke Kreuter","author_inst":"University of Mannheim"},{"author_name":"Daniele Nosenzo","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Severine Toussaert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Johannes Abeler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20087056","rel_title":"Covid-19 Pandemic in relation to levels of Pollution with PM2.5 and Ambient Salinity.

There are however some countries and cities which appear to have contained the pandemic. Common to these countries are environmental factors including the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient salinity. METHOD: PM2.5 and ambient salinity were assessed in a number of cities, differentially affected by Covid-19 infection. The cities chosen to be assessed were divided into two groups. The first group included cities having significantly high rates of Covid-19 infection, while the second group consisted of coastal cities or small island countries, all of which have low rates of Covid-19 infection. Minimum and maximum levels of PM2.5 were obtained from the Air Quality Index, one month before and one month after statutory lockdown. Salinity levels were obtained from a study that assessed chloride ion wet deposition, a surrogate for ambient salinity. RESULTS: One month prior to the statutory national lock-down or mandatory restrictions, there appear to be high levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 67.4 - 118.7 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to lower levels in countries that have contained the infection (min-max 45.6 - 79.8) (p<0.046). One month after national restrictions there still appeared to be higher levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 51 - 90.5 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to countries that have contained the infection (min-max 42.7 - 69.5 AQI) but this was not statistically significant. There seemed to be an inverse relationship between Covid-19 infection and ambient salinity levels. Countries that were spared high Covid-19 infection rates, besides their geographical isolation, also have higher ambient salinity levels (124 - 617mgCl\/m2\/TAG) compared to salinity levels noted in countries with high Covid-19 rates of infection (28.4 - 162. mgCl\/m2\/TAG) (p<0.003). CONCLUSION: High levels of PM2.5 in the presence of low ambient salinity may increase the risk of Covid-19 infection in the population. Addressing these two environmental factors may attenuate the severity of the pandemic.

We generated a comprehensive structured dataset of government interventions and their respective timelines of implementation. To improve transparency and motivate collaborative validation process, information sources are shared via an open library. We also provide codes that enable users to visualise the dataset. Standardization and structure of the dataset facilitate inter-country comparison and the assessment of the impacts of different NPI categories on the epidemic parameters, population health indicators, the economy, and human rights, among others.

Most research on therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 focused on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein, whereas the vulnerable epitopes and functional mechanism of non-RBD regions are poorly understood. Here we isolated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from convalescent COVID-19 patients. An mAb targeting the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, named 4A8, exhibits high neutralization potency against both authentic and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, although it does not block the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and S protein. The cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in complex with 4A8 has been determined to an overall resolution of 3.1 Angstrom and local resolution of 3.4 Angstrom for the 4A8-NTD interface, revealing detailed interactions between the NTD and 4A8. Our functional and structural characterizations discover a new vulnerable epitope of the S protein and identify promising neutralizing mAbs as potential clinical therapy for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiangyang Chi","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Renhong Yan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Biology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, School of Life Sciences, Westlake Univer"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Guanying Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Biology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, School of Life Sciences, Westlake Univer"},{"author_name":"Meng Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhe Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Fan","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yunzhu Dong","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yilong Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhengshan Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yingying Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Biology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, School of Life Sciences, Westlake Univer"},{"author_name":"Jinlong Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yaning Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiaohong Song","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yi Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lu Xia","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Ling Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lihua Hou","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Changming Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jianmin Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qiang Zhou","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Biology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, School of Life Sciences, Westlake Univer"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lukas Geyrhofer","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Marcia R Ferreira","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Rainer Vierlinger","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Samantha Holder","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Samuel Alvarez","author_inst":"Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador"},{"author_name":"Simon Haberfellner","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Verena Ahne","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Viktoria Reisch","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Vito DP Servedio","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Xiao Chen","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Xochilt Maria Pocasangre-Orellana","author_inst":"Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador"},{"author_name":"David Garcia","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Stefan Thurner","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.083618","rel_title":"Multiple expression assessments of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 SARS-CoV-2 entry molecules in the urinary tract and their associations with clinical manifestations of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.083618","rel_abs":"BackgroundSince December 2019, the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first spread quickly in Wuhan, China, then globally. From previously published evidence, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are both pivotal entry molecules that enable cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or a \"cytokine storm,\" is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is often observed in critically ill patients.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in major organs in the human body, especially under specific disease conditions. Multiple sequence alignment of ACE2 in different species was used to explain animal susceptibility. Moreover, the cell-specific expression patterns of ACE2 and cytokine receptors in the urinary tract were assessed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Additional biological relevance was determined through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using an ACE2 specific signature.\n\nResultsOur results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in genitourinary organs. ACE2 was highly and significantly expressed in the kidney among individuals with chronic kidney diseases or diabetic nephropathy. In single cells, ACE2 was primarily enriched in gametocytes in the testis, and renal proximal tubules. The receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL6ST, were remarkably concentrated in endothelial cells, macrophages, and spermatogonial stem cells in the testis, and renal endothelial cells, which suggested the occurrence of alternative damaging mechanisms via autoimmune attacks.\n\nConclusionsThis study provided new insights into the pathogenicity mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 that underlie the clinical manifestations observed in the human testis and kidney. These observations might substantially facilitate the development of effective treatments for this rapidly spreading disease.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaohan Ren","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive;

Here, we used recently released X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptor allows to define residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S up to seven can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S-binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or the acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S-interface. Of note, pigs and dogs which are not or not effectively infected, respectively, have only a few changes in the binding site have relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with viruses from bat and pangolin revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas the bat virus exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibit seven changes relative to human ACE2, a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon, and civet suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts. These analyses provide new insight into the receptor usage and animal source\/origin of SARS-COV-2.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 is threatening people worldwide and there are no drugs or vaccines available to mitigate its spread. The origin of the virus is still unclear and whether pets and livestock can be infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes indicating that the species barrier might be low. However, the lower expression of ACE2 in the upper respiratory tract of some pets and livestock means more research and monitoring should be done to explore the animal source of infection and the risk of potential cross-species transmission. Finally, the analysis also showed that SARS-CoV-2 may not specifically adapted to any of its putative intermediate hosts.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Zhai","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Jiumeng Sun","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Yan","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhang","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Zongzheng Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, China."},{"author_name":"Qi Gao","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Wan-Ting He","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Michael Veit","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Center for Infection Medicine, Veterinary Faculty, Free University Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Shuo Su","author_inst":"MOE Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety, Engineering Laboratory of Animal Immunity of Jiangsu Province, College of Veterina"},{"author_name":"Chao Qin","author_inst":"The State Key Lab of Reproductive;

Our study reveals novel interaction data on the variants and SARS-CoV-2. We could show that ACE2-K26R; which is more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population decrease the electrostatic attraction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2.

As a proof of concept, we focus on the Belgium epidemic, with one of the highest spatial density of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. At the global scale, our analyses confirm the importance of external introduction events in establishing multiple transmission chains in the country. At the country scale, our spatially-explicit phylogeographic analyses highlight that the national lockdown had a relatively low impact on both the lineage dispersal velocity and the long-distance dispersal events within Belgium.

Here, we present our study elucidating the interplay between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses; and hosts miRNAs, an epigenetic regulator, as a mode of pathogenesis, and enlightened how the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections differ in terms of their miRNA mediated interactions with host and its implications in the disease complexity. We have utilized computational approaches to predict potential host and viral miRNAs, and their possible roles in different important functional pathways. We have identified several putative host antiviral miRNAs that can target the SARS viruses, and also SARS viruses encoded miRNAs targeting host genes. In silico predicted targets were also integrated with SARS infected human cells microarray and RNA-seq gene expression data. Comparison of the host miRNA binding profiles on 67 different SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 24 different countries with respective countrys normalized death count surprisingly uncovered some miRNA clusters which are associated with increased death rates. We have found that induced cellular miRNAs can be both a boon and a bane to the host immunity, as they have possible roles in neutralizing the viral threat, parallelly, they can also function as proviral factors. On the other hand, from over representation analysis, interestingly our study revealed that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral miRNAs could target broad immune signaling pathways; only some of the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs are found to uniquely target some immune signaling pathways like-autophagy, IFN-I signaling etc, which might suggest their immune-escape mechanisms for prolonged latency inside some hosts without any symptoms of COVID-19. Further, SARS-CoV-2 can modulate several important cellular pathways which might lead to the increased anomalies in patients with comorbidities like-cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, breathing complications, etc. This might suggest that miRNAs can be a key epigenetic modulator behind the overcomplications amongst the COVID-19 patients. Our results support that miRNAs of host and SARS-CoV-2 can indeed play a role in the pathogenesis which can be further concluded with more experiments. These results will also be useful in designing RNA therapeutics to alleviate the complications from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

The peptide has recently been shown to bind the viral RBD with good efficiency. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the energetics of binding of the peptide to the SARS-CoV2 RBD. We use equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation to study the dynamics of the complex. We perform end-state binding energy calculations to gain a residue-level insight into the binding process and use the information to incorporate point mutations into the peptide. We demonstrate using binding energy calculations that the peptide with certain point mutations, especially E17L, shows a stronger binding to the RBD as compared to the wild type peptide.

At a molecular level, the bottleneck for the infection is the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein to ACE2, an enzyme exposed on human cell membranes. Several experimental structures of the ACE2:RBD complex have been made available, however they offer only a static description of the arrangements of the molecules in either the free or bound states. In order to gain a dynamic description of the binding process that is key to infection, we use molecular simulations with a coarse grained model of the RBD and ACE2. We find that binding occurs in an all-or-none way, without intermediates, and that even in the bound state, the RBD exhibits a considerably dynamic behaviour. From short equilibrium simulations started in the unbound state we provide snapshots that result in a tentative mechanism of binding. Our findings may be important for the development of drug discovery strategies that target the RBD.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David De Sancho","author_inst":"UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Raul Perez-Jimenez","author_inst":"CIC nanoGUNE"},{"author_name":"Jose A Gavira","author_inst":"Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra (CSIC - UGR)"},{"author_name":"Md.

This is a member of Coronaviridae family in the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. In particular, the interaction of viral spike proteins with ACE2 is a critical step in the viral replication cycle. The receptor binding domain of the viral spike proteins and ACE2 have several cysteine residues. In this study, the role of thiol-disulfide balance on the interactions between SARS-CoV\/CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 was investigated using molecular dynamic simulations. The study revealed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all the disulfide bonds of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV\/CoV-2 spike proteins were reduced to thiol groups. The impact on the binding affinity was less severe when the disulfide bridges of only one of the binding partners were reduced to thiols. This computational finding provides a molecular basis for the severity of COVID-19 infection due to the oxidative stress.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sudeep Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire"},{"author_name":"Sanchita Hati","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire"},{"author_name":"Jose A Gavira","author_inst":"Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra (CSIC - UGR)"},{"author_name":"Md.

Their activation makes it imperative to identify methods that can deliver a diagnostic result at low cost. This paper describes an approach which employs sequence variation in the gene coding for its envelope protein as the basis for a scalable, inexpensive test for COVID-19. It achieves this by coupling a simple RNA extraction protocol with low-volume RT-PCR, followed by E-Gel screening and sequencing on high-throughput platforms to analyze 10,000 samples in a run. Slight modifications to the protocol could support screening programs for other known viruses and for viral discovery. Just as the $1,000 genome is transforming medicine, a $1 diagnostic test for viral and bacterial pathogens would represent a major advance for public health.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul DN Hebert","author_inst":"Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Sean WJ Prosser","author_inst":"Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Natalia V Ivanova","author_inst":"Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Evgeny V.

We aim at investigating the sociodemographic and environmental determinants of wellbeing during global lockdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide survey was sent online to the French population during the second week of global lockdown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between March 25, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Volunteers were recruited on social networks, online newspapers, and mailing lists. We analyzed sociodemographic and environmental variables obtained from a co-built and evidence-based questionnaire. Mental wellbeing was measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Results: We analyzed data from 11,391 (56.6%) out of 20,235 participants who answered the questionnaire. After weighting data on age and gender distributions, 5415 of the respondents were male (47.5%), 5932 were female (52.1%), and 52 (0.5%) registered as other. Multivariate analyses indicated that various factors impacted mental wellbeing. Being female (p < .001), a student (p < .001), disabled (p = .001), or having no access to outdoor space (p = 0.02) was associated with lower WEMWBS scores. Conversely, being employed (p < .001) and having more social contacts (p < .01) were both associated with greater mental wellbeing. Interpretation: We revealed differences in mental wellbeing among the French population at the early stages of global lockdown. Authorities should consider the particular vulnerability of students, persons with disabilities, and those living in constrained housing conditions that could increase the negative impact of lockdown on mental health.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederic HAESEBAERT","author_inst":"CH le Vinatier"},{"author_name":"Julie Haesebaert","author_inst":"Lyon University"},{"author_name":"Elodie Zante","author_inst":"Ch Le Vinatier"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Franck","author_inst":"Lyon University"},{"author_name":"Sujeevan Ratnasingham","author_inst":"Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Giulia Piccini","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Manenti","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Troisi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Vacca","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pantano","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta De Santi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cardamone","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Kabanova","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Tumour Immunology Unit, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agrati","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta Castilletti","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Capobianchi","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arianna Emiliozzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Fabbiani","author_inst":"Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Montagnani","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Montomoli","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy; Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Sala","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rino Rappuoli","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lukas Geyrhofer","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Marcia R Ferreira","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Rainer Vierlinger","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Samantha Holder","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Samuel Alvarez","author_inst":"Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador"},{"author_name":"Simon Haberfellner","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Verena Ahne","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Viktoria Reisch","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Vito DP Servedio","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Xiao Chen","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Xochilt Maria Pocasangre-Orellana","author_inst":"Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador"},{"author_name":"David Garcia","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Stefan Thurner","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.080960","rel_title":"The transcriptomic profiling of COVID-19 compared to SARS, MERS, Ebola, and H1N1","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.080960","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis that threatens our way of life. As of April 29, 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 200,000 lives, with a global mortality rate of ~7% and recovery rate of ~30%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the IL-8, IL-6, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of both COVID-19 and Ebola are more similar compared to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alsamman M Alsamman","author_inst":"Search Results Web results  Agricultural Genetic Engineering Research Institute (AGERl)"},{"author_name":"Hatem Zayed","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar."},{"author_name":"Elodie Zante","author_inst":"Ch Le Vinatier"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Franck","author_inst":"Lyon University"},{"author_name":"Sujeevan Ratnasingham","author_inst":"Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Giulia Piccini","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Manenti","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy;

First evidence from China suggests that HCWs are at risk for anxiety and depression. However, generalizability to western countries is limited. The current study aimed at exploring HCWs mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland. In addition, we conducted a network analysis to investigate the independent effect of risk and protective factors on HCWs mental health and their interplay. Methods: In an exploratory, cross-sectional, nation-wide online survey, we assessed demographics, work characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and anxiety, depression, and burnout in 857 physicians and 553 nurses during the pandemic in Switzerland. At the time of data collection, Switzerland had among the highest per capita rate of COVID-19 cases in the world. Results: Overall symptom levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout were elevated. Women, nurses, frontline staff and HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients reported more symptoms than their peers. However, these effects were all small and, in the network analysis, most of them did not remain significant after controlling for the other factors. Whereas COVID-19 exposure was only partially associated with mental health, perceived support by the employer independently predicted anxiety and burnout. Conclusions: Our finding that HCWs had elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout underscores the importance to systematically monitor HCWs mental health during this ongoing pandemic. Because perceived support and mental health impairments were negatively related, we encourage the implementation of supportive measures for HCWs well-being during this crisis.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sonja Weilenmann","author_inst":"Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Jutta Ernst","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Nursing Science, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Heidi Petry","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Nursing Science, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Onur Sazpinar","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Spital Zollikerberg"},{"author_name":"Monique C Pfaltz","author_inst":"University of Zurich and Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Samuel Gehrke","author_inst":"Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Francesca Paolercio","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Roland von Kaenel","author_inst":"Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Tobias Raphael Spiller","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pantano","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta De Santi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cardamone","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Kabanova","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy;

In this study, we have used the RNA-seq gene expression pattern in the COVID-19 affected lung biopsy cells and compared it with the effects observed in typical cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We performed functional overrepresentation analyses using these differentially expressed genes to signify the processes\/pathways which could be deregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in the symptomatic impairments observed in COVID-19. Our results showed that the significantly altered processes include inflammatory responses, antiviral cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and interleukin signaling etc. along with downmodulated processes related to lungs functionality like-responses to hypoxia, lung development, respiratory processes, cholesterol biosynthesis and surfactant metabolism. We also found that the viral protein interacting hosts proteins involved in similar pathways like: respiratory failure, lung diseases, asthma, and hypoxia responses etc., suggesting viral proteins might be deregulating the processes related to acute lung injury\/breathing complications in COVID-19 patients. Protein-protein interaction networks of these processes and map of gene expression of deregulated genes revealed that several viral proteins can directly or indirectly modulate the host genes\/proteins of those lung related processes along with several host transcription factors and miRNAs. Surfactant proteins and their regulators SPD, SPC, TTF1 etc. which maintains the stability of the pulmonary tissue are found to be downregulated through viral NSP5, NSP12 that could lead to deficient gaseous exchange by the surface films. Mitochondrial dysfunction owing to the aberration of NDUFA10, NDUFAF5, SAMM50 etc. by NSP12; abnormal thrombosis in lungs through atypical PLAT, EGR1 functions by viral ORF8, NSP12; dulled hypoxia responses due to unusual shift in HIF-1 downstream signaling might be the causative elements behind the acute lung injury in COVID-19 patients. Our study put forward a distinct mechanism of probable virus induced lung damage apart from cytokine storm and advocate the need of further research for alternate therapy in this direction.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abul B.M.M.K.

Daily reported numbers (March 29th to April 28th) are based on Our World in Data database (derived from the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention, ECDC). In all seven countries, numbers of new cases peaked on Thursday-Friday, five days after the weekend, corresponding with a reported ~5-day lag between contact with an infected person and the manifestation of clinical symptoms. Death tolls peaked on Wednesday-Thursday in all seven countries, ~12-14 days following a weekend, corresponding with the reported median of 14-day hospitalization before death. One may suspect that the weekend restricts the availability of testing or reporting of new cases, that are eventually reported during the following week. However, to completely account for both observations, this artifact should occur uniformly in all the above-mentioned countries and consistently along the entire month studied. Moreover, deaths are defined events and seems less likely to be recorded or reported inaccurately, at least for the vast majority of cases. Thus, we hypothesize that an increase in inter-generational social interactions occurs during the weekend, which facilitates transfer of COVID-19 from younger people to older vulnerable individuals. These and additional infected older people account for most recognized COVID-19 cases and deaths, which may occur at regular time intervals, specifically in this vulnerable population. Additional explanations may include weekly rhythms in immune functions, hospital care quality, or other various health-related behaviors. Our hypotheses should be re-tested and refined based on databases that accurately report events times when these will become available.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Itay Ricon-Becker","author_inst":"Tel-Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Tarrasch","author_inst":"Tel-Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Pablo Blinder","author_inst":"Tel-Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Shamgar Ben-Eliyahu","author_inst":"Tel-Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Monique C Pfaltz","author_inst":"University of Zurich and Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Samuel Gehrke","author_inst":"Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Francesca Paolercio","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Roland von Kaenel","author_inst":"Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Tobias Raphael Spiller","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pantano","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta De Santi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cardamone","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Kabanova","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy;

Understanding of host-SARS-CoV-2 interaction in viral pathogenesis is still in its infancy. In this study we aimed to correlate how SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its proteins for tackling the host immune response; parallelly, how host epigenetic factors might play a role in this pathogenesis was also investigated. We have utilized a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to elucidate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2. Integrating the experimentally validated host interactome proteins and differentially expressed host genes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have taken a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to delineate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2 in various signaling pathways. Also, we have shown how host epigenetic factors are involved in the deregulation of gene expression. Strikingly, we have found that several transcription factors and other epigenetic factors can modulate some immune signaling pathways, helping both host and virus. We have identified miRNA hsa-miR-429 whose transcription factor was also upregulated and targets were downregulated and this miRNA can have pivotal role in suppression of host immune responses. While searching for the pathways in which viral proteins interact with host proteins, we have found pathways like-HIF-1 signaling, autophagy, RIG-I signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, Fatty acid oxidation\/degradation, Il-17 signaling etc significantly associated. We observed that these pathways can be either hijacked or suppressed by the viral proteins, leading to the improved viral survival and life-cycle. Moreover, pathways like-Relaxin signaling in lungs suggests aberration by the viral proteins might lead to the lung pathophysiology found in COVID-19. Also, enrichment analyses suggest that deregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in heart development, kidney development, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications etc. might suggest why patients with comorbidities are becoming more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 integrates its proteins in different immune signaling pathway and other cellular signaling pathways for developing efficient immune evasion mechanisms, while leading the host to more complicated disease condition. Our findings would help in designing more targeted therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

The impact of the pandemic in low and middle income countries has the potential to worsen already strained access to surgical care. Timely assessment of surgical volumes in these countries remains challenging. Objective: To determine whether usage data from a globally used anesthesiology calculator mobile application can serve as a proxy for global surgical case volume and contribute to monitoring of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in World Bank low income countries where official data collection is not currently practical. Design: Subset of data from an ongoing observational cohort study of users of the application collected from October 1, 2018 to April 18, 2020. Setting: The mobile application is available from public sources; users download and use the application per their own clinical needs on personal mobile devices. Participants: No user data was excluded from the study. Exposure(s): Events with impacts on surgical case volumes, including weekends, holidays, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): It was previously noted that application usage was decreased on weekends and during winter holidays. We subsequently hypothesized that more detailed analysis would reveal impacts of country-specific or region-specific holidays on the volume of app use. Results: 4,300,975 data points from 92,878 unique users were analyzed. Physicians and other anesthesia providers comprised 85.8% of the study population. Application use was reduced on holidays and weekends and correlated with fluctuations in surgical volume. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial reductions in app use globally and regionally. There was strong cross correlation between COVID-19 case count and reductions in app use. By country, there was a median global reduction in app use to 58% of baseline (interquartile range, 46%-75%). Application use in low-income continues to decline but in high-income countries has stabilized. Conclusions and Relevance: Application usage metadata provides a real-time indicator of surgical volume. This data may be used to identify impacted regions where disruptions to surgical care are disproportionate or prolonged. A dashboard for continuous visualization of these data has been deployed.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vikas N O'Reilly-Shah","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Wil Van Cleve","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Dustin R Long","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Moll","author_inst":"Institute of Anesthesiology, University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Faye M Evans","author_inst":"Boston Childrens Hospital, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Sunshine","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Kassebaum","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ewen M Harrison","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Craig S Jabaley","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Rifat Hamoudi","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rabih Halwani","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Hamid","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Norbert Nowotny","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna"},{"author_name":"Alawi Alsheikh-Ali","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Concetta Castilletti","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Capobianchi","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arianna Emiliozzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Fabbiani","author_inst":"Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Montagnani","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Specialized and Internal Medicine, Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Montomoli","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy; Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Sala","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rino Rappuoli","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lukas Geyrhofer","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Marcia R Ferreira","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Rainer Vierlinger","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Samantha Holder","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Samuel Alvarez","author_inst":"Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador"},{"author_name":"Simon Haberfellner","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Verena Ahne","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Viktoria Reisch","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Vito DP Servedio","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Xiao Chen","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Xochilt Maria Pocasangre-Orellana","author_inst":"Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador"},{"author_name":"David Garcia","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Stefan Thurner","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"}]}
