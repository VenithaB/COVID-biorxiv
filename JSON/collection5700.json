Currently, whether wearing facemasks in public should be a measure to prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains contraversial.1 This is largely because there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for coronavirus to directly support this. However, lessons may be taken from published RCTs examining influenza-like illness (ILI).2,3 Recent studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares similar transmission route with influenza virus,4 and the incidence of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with ILI is high.5 Therefore, we undertook this meta-analysis of RCTs examining the efficacy of wearing facemasks to prevent ILI in community settings, irrespective of confirmatory testing for the causative virus. We undertook a systematic literature search for RCTs related to facemasks and ILI between 1966 and April 2020 using PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane library. RCTs undertaken in community (not hospital) settings comparing wearing and not wearing facemasks for ILI were included. Incidence of ILI (e.g., fever, cough, headache, sore throat, aches or pains in muscles or joints) was estimated per group. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. We screened 899 related abstracts and eventually included 8 RCTs (Figure S1). Basic characteristics and quality of included RCTs are listed in Supplement. Participants wearing facemasks had a significantly lower risk of developing ILI than those not wearing facemasks (pooled RR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) and there was no heterogeneity (Figure 1). The decreased risk of ILI was more pronounced if everyone wore facemask irrespective of whether they were infected or not (RR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91), compared to those wearing facemasks when infected (RR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.58-1.56) or uninfected (RR=1.26, 95% CI: 0.69-2.31). This study shows that wearing facemasks, irrespective of infection status, is effective in preventing ILI spread in the community. This situation mirrors what is happening now in public settings where we do not know who has been infected and who has not. Although there are no RCTs of facemasks for SARS-CoV-2, as with other simple measures such as social distancing and handwashing, these data support the recommendation to wear facemasks in public to further reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and flatten the curve of this pandemic, especially when social distancing is impractical, such as shopping, or travelling with public transport for work that cannot be done from home.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Health Management Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China"},{"author_name":"Michael Doherty","author_inst":"Academic Rheumatology Department, Division of Rheumatology, Orthopaedics and Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Monica S.M.

Local factors that may be associated with variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission have not been well studied. Objective: To examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time. Design: Observational study Setting: 211 counties in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Participants: Residents within the counties (55% of the US population) Exposures: Social distancing as measured by percent change in visits to non-essential businesses, population density, lagged daily wet bulb temperatures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) which is the estimated number of cases generated by one case at a given time during the pandemic. Results: Median case incidence was 1185 cases and fatality rate was 43.7 deaths per 100,000 people for the top decile of 21 counties, nearly ten times the incidence and fatality rate in the lowest density quartile. Average Rt in the first two weeks was 5.7 (SD 2.5) in the top decile, compared to 3.1 (SD 1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to non-essential businesses was associated with a 57% decrease in Rt (95% confidence interval, 56% to 58%). Cumulative temperature effects over 4 to 10 days prior to case incidence were nonlinear; relative Rt decreased as temperatures warmed above 32F to 53F, which was the point of minimum Rt, then increased between 53F and 66F, at which point Rt began to decrease. At 55F, and with a 70% reduction in visits to non-essential business, 96% of counties were estimated to fall below a threshold Rt of 1.0, including 86% of counties among the top density decile and 98% of counties in the lowest density quartile. Conclusions and Relevance: Social distancing, lower population density, and temperate weather change were associated with a decreased SARS-Co-V-2 Rt in counties across the United States. These relationships can inform selective public policy planning in communities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Rubin","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Jing Huang","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Brian T Fisher","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gasparrini","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vicky Tam","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Lihai Song","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Jason Kaufman","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kate Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Arushi Jain","author_inst":"CHOP"},{"author_name":"Heather Griffis","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Koby Crammer","author_inst":"The Technion, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094789","rel_title":"Quantitative COVID-19 infectiousness estimate correlating with viral shedding and culturability suggests 68% pre-symptomatic transmissions","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094789","rel_abs":"A person clinically diagnosed with COVID 19 can infect others for several days before and after the onset of symptoms.

In this work, we attempt to provide a better quantitative estimate for the temporal infectiousness profile using serial interval data from a combined 1251 individuals reported in the literature. We show that the infectiousness profile which we calculate correlates well with the viral shedding kinetics from nasopharyngeal swabs (rho=0.97, p=0.00) and culturability (rho=0.83, p=0.01). The profile suggests that a 68.4% (95% CI: 67.0-69.7%) of the infections are caused by infections before the symptoms appear, which is a much stronger pre-symptomatic influence than what was predicted in the literature 44% (95% CI: 25-69%) using serial data from 77 individuals.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meher K Prakash","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Jing Huang","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Brian T Fisher","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gasparrini","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vicky Tam","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Lihai Song","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Jason Kaufman","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kate Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Arushi Jain","author_inst":"CHOP"},{"author_name":"Heather Griffis","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Koby Crammer","author_inst":"The Technion, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20093617","rel_title":"Use of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 epidemic as an epidemiological surveillance strategy - preliminary results of the evaluation of six Brazilian capitals","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20093617","rel_abs":"In early 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the pandemic situation of the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2), which causes Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). In Brazil by the end of April 2020, another 110 thousand cases and 5,000 deaths had been confirmed. The scarcity of laboratory resources and overload of the care network, added to the broad clinical spectrum of the disease, can make it difficult to capture all mortality from this disease through epidemiological surveillance based on individual notification of cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the excess of deaths in Brazilian capitals with the highest incidence of COVID-19, as a way of validating the method, we also evaluated a capital with low incidence. We assessed weekly mortality from all causes during the year 2020, up to the epidemiological week 17, compared with the previous year. The data were obtained through the National Civil Registry Information Center (CNIRC, acronym in Portuguese). We estimate the expected mortality and the 95% confidence interval by projecting the observed mortality in 2019 for the population of 2020. In the five capitals with the highest incidences it was possible to identify excess deaths in the pandemic period, the age group most affected were those over 60 years old, 31% of the excess deaths occurred in the population between 20 and 59 years old. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.94) between the excess of deaths in each city and the number of deaths confirmed by epidemiological surveillance. There was no excess of deaths in the capital with the lowest incidence, nor among the population under 20 years old. We estimate that epidemiological surveillance managed to capture only 52% of all mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the cities studied. Considering the simplicity of the method, its low cost and reliability for assessing the real burden of the disease, we believe that the assessment of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic should be widely used as a complementary tool to regular epidemiological surveillance and its use should be encouraged by WHO.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre Ricardo Ribas Freitas","author_inst":"Prefeitura Municipal de Campinas"},{"author_name":"N M Medeiros","author_inst":"Secretaria Municipal de Saude de Campinas"},{"author_name":"Livia Frutuoso","author_inst":"Ministerio da Saude"},{"author_name":"Otto A Beckedorff","author_inst":"Faculdade Sao Leopoldo Mandic"},{"author_name":"Lucas M A Martin","author_inst":"Faculdade Sao Leopoldo Mandic"},{"author_name":"Marcela M M Coelho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Giovanna G S Freitas","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Marilia"},{"author_name":"Daniele R Q Lemos","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Christus"},{"author_name":"Luciano P G Cavalcanti","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Ceara"},{"author_name":"Arushi Jain","author_inst":"CHOP"},{"author_name":"Heather Griffis","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Koby Crammer","author_inst":"The Technion, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20093807","rel_title":"Unreported cases for Age Dependent COVID-19 Outbreak in Japan","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20093807","rel_abs":"We investigate the age structured data for the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan.

Prior studies indicate the protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health, mediated by vitamin D synthesis. In this study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (COVID-19 deaths). Methods: We carry out an observational study, applying a fixed-effect log-linear regression model to a panel dataset of 152 countries over a period of 108 days (n=6524). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables to test our hypothesis and isolate UVI effect from potential confounding factors such as underlying time trends, country-specific time-constant and time-varying factors such as weather. Findings: After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p < 0.01] as well as a 1.0 percentage points decline in the daily growth rates of CFR [p < 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms of the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (-11.88%) and CFR (-38.46%). Our results are consistent across different model specifications. Interpretation: We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths, indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention will be very attractive because it is cost-effective and widely available.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Kalippurayil Moozhipurath","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Lennart Kraft","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Bernd Skiera","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Otto A Beckedorff","author_inst":"Faculdade Sao Leopoldo Mandic"},{"author_name":"Lucas M A Martin","author_inst":"Faculdade Sao Leopoldo Mandic"},{"author_name":"Marcela M M Coelho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Giovanna G S Freitas","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Marilia"},{"author_name":"Daniele R Q Lemos","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Christus"},{"author_name":"Luciano P G Cavalcanti","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Ceara"},{"author_name":"Arushi Jain","author_inst":"CHOP"},{"author_name":"Heather Griffis","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Koby Crammer","author_inst":"The Technion, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094888","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis: An autopsy series with clinical and laboratory correlation.","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094888","rel_abs":"Background: A subset of COVID-19 patients exhibit clinical features of cytokine storm. However, clinicopathologic features diagnostic of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have not been reported. Pathologic studies to date have largely focused on the pulmonary finding of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). To this aim, we study the reticuloendothelial organs of four consecutive patients dying of COVID-19 and correlate with clinical and laboratory parameters to detect HLH. Methods: Autopsies restricted to chest and abdomen were performed on four patients who succumbed to COVID-19. Spleen, liver, and multiple pulmonary hilar\/mediastinal lymph nodes were sampled in all cases. Bone marrow was obtained by rib squeeze in a subset of cases. Routine H&E staining as well as immunohistochemical staining for CD163 was performed to detect hemophagocytosis. Clinical and laboratory results from pre-mortem blood samples were used to calculate H-scores. Findings: All four cases demonstrated DAD within the lungs. Three of the four cases had histologic evidence of hemophagocytosis within pulmonary hilar\/mediastinal lymph nodes. One case showed hemophagocytosis in the spleen but none showed hemophagocytosis in liver or bone marrow. Lymphophagocytosis was the predominant form of hemophagocytosis observed. One patient showed diagnostic features of HLH with an H-score of 217 while a second patient was likely HLH with a partial H-score of 145 due to missing triglyceride level. Both patients exhibited high fever and early onset rise in serum ferritin; however, neither bicytopenia, pancytopenia, nor hypofibrinogenemia were observed in either. The remaining two patients had H-scores of 131 and 96. Interpretation: This is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 associated HLH. Identification of HLH in a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 will inform clinical trials of therapeutic strategies.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrey Prilutskiy","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Kritselis","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Artem Shevtsov","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ilyas Yambayev","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Charitha Vadlamudi","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Qing Zhao","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yachana Kataria","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shayna Sarosiek","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam Lerner","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Mark Sloan","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Karen Quillen","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Burks","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20093708","rel_title":"Mental Health Status among the South Indian Pharmacy Students during Covid-19 Pandemic Quarantine Period: A Cross-Sectional Study","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20093708","rel_abs":"Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak created a major panic among all the citizens of the country owing to its severity, contagiousness within the community, lack of specific treatment and possibility of re-infection. All these factors along with the uncertain behaviour of the virus lead to state of fear and concern all throught out the nation. The current study represents the mental health survey conducted on the students of South India after the completion of one month quarantine period of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology: The present study is a cross-sectional, web-based online survey which consists of 21-item DASS questionnaire. This was used to assess the emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. Using Google Forms, the questionnaire was randomly distributed among the pharmacy students of selected colleges. Mean with standard deviation was calculated for continuous variables and the number with percentage was calculated for categorical variables. Results: A total of 500 participants responded to the questionnaire. More than half of the responses were received from females (65%). On assessment it was found that, 26 % of respondents reported severe to extremely severe depressive symptoms; 31.5 % of respondents reported severe to extremely severe anxiety symptoms, and 19 % reported severe to extremely severe stress levels. Conclusion: In India during the outbreak of COVID-19, an alarming number of students were found to have an impact on mental health due to the outbreak and were observed to have higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The study findings shows the need of conducting more such studies and can be used to prepare appropriate psychological interventions to improve mental health among the young public during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vidyadhara Suryadevara","author_inst":"Chebrolu Hanumaiah Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chakravarthy Adusumalli","author_inst":"Chebrolu Hanumaiah Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Pramod Kumar Adusumilli","author_inst":"Chebrolu Hanumaiah Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sri Harsha Chalasani","author_inst":"JSS College of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Rahul Radhakrishnan","author_inst":"KLE College of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Qing Zhao","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yachana Kataria","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shayna Sarosiek","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam Lerner","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Mark Sloan","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Karen Quillen","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Burks","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20090340","rel_title":"The German COVID-19 Survey on Mental Health: Primary Results","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20090340","rel_abs":"Abstract First cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan, China in early December 2019. Preliminary data from China indicated a substantial impact on mental health by the pandemic and its associated lockdown measures. Such measures are unprecedented for the majority of people and may affect their lives tremendously. The current survey was developed to assess mental health in response to the lockdown in Germany. Methods We conducted a web-based self-report survey including various aspects of mental health (e.g. PHQ-D, PHQ-4, WHO-5 and comparative questions on a 5-point Likert scale concerning sleep, irritability & interpersonal violence). First wave data were taken during the height of lockdown measures in Germany from 1 April to 15 April 2020. Results A total of 3,545 volunteers took part in this cross-sectional survey. Mean age was 40.36 years (SD = 11.70; 83.1% female, 15.2% male). Acute or chronic disease was reported by 36.7% (physical) and 24.7% (mental) of subjects. Participants scored mild severity distress in the PHQ stress module. Depression and anxiety as assessed by PHQ-4 was significantly higher than in reference samples. The mean well-being score (WHO-5) was 50.7, thus pointing towards possible signs of depression. Furthermore, we found significant gender differences for anxiety and depression with women showing higher levels. 45.3% of participants reported worsened sleep, increased levels of irritation, anger and aggression compared to pre-pandemic times. Most importantly, 5% of all participants reported experiencing interpersonal violence (IPV). Discussion This is one of the first and largest surveys on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in a European society reflecting a relatively well educated and financially secure sample. Yet, there is evidence for a substantial mental burden with increased levels of stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance and irritability. Most importantly and also most concerning is the finding of a one-month prevalence of 5% IPV. We think it is of vital importance to continuously monitor the mental health of the general public during this pandemic and its aftermath and to carefully screen for IPV and its risk factors such as stress, sleep problems and anger.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefanie Jung","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jonas Kneer","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Tillmann Krueger","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Sri Harsha Chalasani","author_inst":"JSS College of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Rahul Radhakrishnan","author_inst":"KLE College of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Qing Zhao","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yachana Kataria","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shayna Sarosiek","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam Lerner","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Mark Sloan","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Karen Quillen","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Burks","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094466","rel_title":"Text Mining Approach to Analyze Coronavirus Impact: Mexico City as Case of Study","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094466","rel_abs":"The epidemiological outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or Covid-19) in China, and its rapid spread, gave rise to the first pandemic in the digital age.

Methods: Data were from a baseline online survey of an inception cohort recruited in the weeks following the introduction of physical distancing and movement restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. These restrictions resulted in widespread unemployment and working hour reduction. Psychological distress was measured using the Kessler-6 scale. Data on nature of work loss, social interactions, demographic, job and occupational characteristics were also collected. Regression modelling was conducted to determine the relationship between work loss, social interactions and psychological distress, accounting for confounders. Results: Among the 551 study participants 31% reported severe psychological distress, 35% in those with job loss and 28% in those still employed but working less. Those who had significantly greater odds of high psychological distress were younger, female, had lost their job and had lower social interactions. The relationship between job loss and distress became non-significant when financial stress, and occupation were included in the regression model, but the protective effect of higher social interactions remained significant. Discussion: There was a high prevalence of psychological distress in people losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Age, gender, job loss and social interactions were strongly associated with distress. Interventions that promote social interaction may help to reduce distress during among people losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex Collie","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Luke Sheehan","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Caryn van Vreden","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Genevieve Grant","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Peter Whiteford","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Dennis Petrie","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Malcolm R Sim","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Shayna Sarosiek","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam Lerner","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Mark Sloan","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Karen Quillen","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Burks","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20093898","rel_title":"Remdesivir in treatment of COVID-19: A systematic benefit-risk assessment","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20093898","rel_abs":"Background: There is a need to identify effective, safe treatments for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) rapidly, given the current, ongoing pandemic. A systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted to strengthen the ongoing understanding of the benefit-risk balance for remdesivir in COVID-19 treatment by using a structured method which uses all available data. Methods: The Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework was used to assess the overall benefit-risk of the use of remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. We searched PubMed,Google Scholar and government agency websites to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking remdesivir for COVID-19. A value tree was constructed and key benefits and risks were ranked by two clinicians in order of considered importance. Results: Several key benefits and risks for use of remdesivir in COVID-19 compared to placebo have been identified. In one trial, the benefit of time to clinical improvement was not statistically significant (21 vs 23 days, HR=1.23, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.75), although the study was underpowered. In another trial, a shorter time to recovery in patients treated with remdesivir was observed (11 vs 15 days), with non-significant reduced mortality risk (8% vs 12%). Risk data were only available from one trial. This trial reported fewer serious adverse events in patients taking remdesivir (18%) comparted to the placebo group (26%), however more patients in the remdesivir group discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event compared to those patients receiving placebo (12% vs 5%). Conclusions: Preliminary clinical trial results suggest a favourable benefit-risk profile for remdesivir compared to placebo, however there is limited safety data available at the current time. The current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks for which further data are needed. Ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefit-risk assessment.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miranda Davies","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Vicki Osborne","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Samantha Lane","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Debabrata Roy","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Dhanda","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Alison Evans","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Saad AW Shakir","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Shayna Sarosiek","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam Lerner","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Mark Sloan","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Karen Quillen","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Burks","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Tasian","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095117","rel_title":"CORRELATION BETWEEN CHEST COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY AND LUNG ULTRASONOGRAPHY IN PATIENTS WITH CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095117","rel_abs":"INTRODUCTION: There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), in chest X-ray and Computed Tomography scan (CT). At this moment, the role of Lung Ultrasonography (LUS) has yet to be explored. OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between LUS findings and chest CT in confirmed (positive RT-PCR) or clinically highly suspicious (dyspnea, fever, myasthenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, dry cough, ageusia or anosmia) of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Prospective study carried out in the emergency department (ED) of confirmed or clinically highly suspicious COVID-19 patients who were subjected to a chest CT and concurrent LUS exam. An experienced ED physician performed the LUS exam blind to the clinical history and results of the CT scan, which were reviewed by two radiologists in consensus for signs compatible with COVID-19 (bilateral ground-glass opacities in peripheral distribution). Compatible LUS exam was considered a bilateral pattern of B-lines, irregular pleural line and subpleural consolidations. RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, fifty-one patients were consecutively enrolled. The indication for CT was a negative or indeterminate RT-PCR test (49.0%) followed by suspicion of pulmonary embolism (41.2%). Radiological signs compatible with COVID-19 were present in thirty-seven patients (72.5%) on CT scan and forty patients (78.4%) on LUS exam. The presence of LUS findings was correlated with a positive CT scan suggestive of COVID-19 (OR: 13.3, 95%CI: 4.5-39.6, p<0.001) with a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 78.6%, positive predictive value of 92.5% and negative of 100.0%. There was no missed diagnosis of COVID-19 with LUS compared to CT in our cohort. The LUS Score had a good correlation with CT total severity score (ICC 0.803, 95% CI 0.60-0.90, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: LUS presents similar accuracy compared to chest CT to detect lung abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"yale tung chen","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine.

Repurposing existing drugs and rapidly launching clinical trials present the greatest near-term opportunities for mitigating COVID19s impact. Many treatments have already been administered to COVID19 patients but have not been systematically evaluated. We performed a systematic literature review to identify and assess all treatments reported to be administered to COVID19 patients. Methods We searched PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and ChinaXiv for articles reporting treatments for COVID19 patients published between Dec 1, 2019 and Mar 27, 2020. All studies reporting treatments were included. Data for each paper were manually extracted by two independent extractors. Outcomes included the duration from drug administration to clinically-meaningful response (complete symptom resolution or hospital discharge). Data were analysed descriptively. Results We identified 2,706 articles from single patient case reports to single-centre interventional studies. Of these, 155 studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 9,152 patients from 14 different countries. The cohort was 45.4% female and 98.3% hospitalised, and mean (SD) age was 44.4 years (SD 21.0). The most frequently administered drug classes were antivirals, antibiotics, and corticosteroids, and of the 115 reported drugs, the most frequently administered was combination lopinavir\/ritonavir, which was associated with a response time of 11.7 (1.09) days. Discussion A large number of treatments have been administered to the first 9,152 reported cases of COVID19. Further work is needed to prioritise drugs for investigation in well-controlled clinical trials and treatment protocols.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide and pose a major public health burden. There is increasing evidence that men are more likely to die from SARS-CoV-2 infection than women. However, underlying factors that mediate the observed sex bias in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unknown. Methods. In this retrospective cohort, we included COVID-19 patients who were admitted to an Intensive Care Unit at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. We obtained demographic data of all patients who were discharged or had died by 29th April 2020. We systematically analyzed sex hormones as well as cytokine and chemokine responses in male and female patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections upon hospital admission. We used uni- and multivariable linear regression methods to identify potential risk factors for disease severity in males and females. Findings. All enrolled patients (n=45; n=35 males and n=10 females) presented comorbidities with hypertension being the most common (45.7% in males; 40% in females), followed by cancer (35% in males; 40% in females), obesity (34.3% in males and 30% in females), type II diabetes (25.7% in males and 20% in females) and chronic heart diseases (8.6% in males and 0% in females). We detected that the vast majority of male COVID-19 patients present low testosterone (68.6%) and low dihydrotestosterone (48.6%) levels. In contrast, most female COVID-19 patients have elevated testosterone levels (60%) without alterations in dihydrotestosterone levels. Both, female and male COVID-19 patients may present elevated estradiol levels (45.7% in males and 40% in females). Disease severity defined by SOFA score correlates with elevated cytokine responses (e.g. IL-6) in males and IL-2 in females. In male COVID-19 patients, testosterone levels negatively correlate with inflammatory IL-2 and IFN-{gamma}, whereas estradiol levels positively correlate with the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Vice versa, in female COVID-19 patients, testosterone levels positively correlate with inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6). Interpretation. We here show that critically ill male COVID-19 patients suffer from severe testosterone and dihydrotestosterone deficiencies. Both androgens are required to mount antiviral immune responses to combat infection in males.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Schroeder","author_inst":"Department for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Berfin Tuku","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for EXperimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Dominik Jarczak","author_inst":"Department for Critical Care Medicine, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Axel Nierhaus","author_inst":"Department for Critical Care Medicine, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Tian Bai","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for EXperimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Henning Jacobsen","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Martin Zickler","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Zacharias Mueller","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Stanelle-Bertram","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Andreas Meinhardt","author_inst":"Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Justus-Liebig University of Giessen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jens Aberle","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Stefan Kluge","author_inst":"Department for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Guelsah Gabriel","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology; University for Veterinary Medicine, Hanno"},{"author_name":"Casey J Kim","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Anna Wing","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Michael Mayer","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ruth-Anne Pai","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sarah Frankl","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20073742","rel_title":"Evaluating transmission heterogeneity and super-spreading event of COVID-19 in a metropolis of China","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20073742","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 caused rapid mass infection worldwide. Understanding its transmission characteristics including heterogeneity is of vital importance for prediction and intervention of future epidemics. In addition, transmission heterogeneity usually envokes super spreading events (SSEs) where certain individuals infect large numbers of secondary cases. Till now, studies of transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 and its underlying reason are far from reaching an agreement. MethodsWe collected information of all infected cases between January 21 and February 26, 2020 from official public sources in Tianjin, a metropolis of China. Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number R and the dispersion parameter k which characterized the transmission potential and heterogeneity, respectively. Furthermore, we studied the SSE in Tianjin outbreak and evaluated the effect of control measures undertaken by local government based on the heterogeneous model. Results: A total of 135 confirmed cases (including 34 imported cases and 101 local infections) in Tianjin by February 26th 2020 entered the study. We grouped them into 43 transmission chains with the largest chain of 45 cases and the longest chain of 4 generations. The estimated reproduction number R was at 0.67 (95%CI: 0.54[~]0.84), and the dispersion parameter k was at 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13[~]0.88). A super spreader causing six infections in Tianjin, was identified. In addition, our simulation results showed that the outbreak in Tianjin would have caused 165 infections and sustained for 7.56 generations on average if no control measures had been taken by local government since January 28th. Conclusions: Our analysis suggested that the transmission of COVID-19 was subcritical but with significant heterogeneity and may incur SSE. More efforts are needed to verify the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in other populations and its contributing factors, which is important for developing targeted measures to curb the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunjun Zhang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yuying Li","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Mingyuan Li","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Henning Jacobsen","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Martin Zickler","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Zacharias Mueller","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Stanelle-Bertram","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Andreas Meinhardt","author_inst":"Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Justus-Liebig University of Giessen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jens Aberle","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Stefan Kluge","author_inst":"Department for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Guelsah Gabriel","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology; University for Veterinary Medicine, Hanno"},{"author_name":"Casey J Kim","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Anna Wing","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Michael Mayer","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ruth-Anne Pai","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sarah Frankl","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20083386","rel_title":"A Rapid Decrease in Stroke, Acute Coronary Syndrome, and Corresponding Interventions at 65 United States Hospitals Following Emergence of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20083386","rel_abs":"Background Following the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), early reports suggested a decrease in stroke and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We sought to provide descriptive statistics for stroke and ACS from a sample of hospitals throughout the United States, comparing data from March 2020 to similar months pre-COVID. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 65 academic and community hospitals in the Vizient Clinical Data Base. The primary outcome is monthly count of stroke and ACS, and acute procedures for both, from February and March in 2020 compared to the same months in 2018 and 2019. Results are aggregated for all hospitals and reported by Census Region. Results We identified 51,246 strokes (42,780 ischemic, 8,466 hemorrhagic), 1,043 mechanical thrombectomies (MT), 836 tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administrations, 36,551 ACS, and 3,925 percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for ACS. In February 2020, relative to February 2018 and 2019, hospitalizations with any discharge diagnosis of stroke and ACS increased by 9.8% and 12.1%, respectively, while in March 2020 they decreased 18.5% and 7.5%, relative to March 2018 and 2019. When only including hospitalizations with the primary discharge diagnosis of stroke or ACS, in March 2020 they decreased 17.6% and 25.7%, respectively. In March 2020, tPA decreased 3.3%, MT increased 18.8%, although in February 2020 it had increased 36.8%, and PCI decreased 14.7%. These decreases were observed in all Census regions. Conclusions Following greater recognition of the risks of COVID-19, hospitalizations with stroke and ACS were markedly diminished in a geographically diverse sample of United States hospitals. Because the most likely explanation is that some patients with stroke and ACS did not seek medical care, the underlying reasons for this decrease warrant additional study to inform public health efforts and clinical care during this and future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam de Havenon","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"John Ney","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Brian Callaghan","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Alen Delic","author_inst":"University fo Utah"},{"author_name":"Sam Hohmann","author_inst":"Vizient"},{"author_name":"Ernie Shippey","author_inst":"Vizient"},{"author_name":"Shadi Yaghi","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Anadani","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Gregory Esper","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Majersik","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Jens Aberle","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Stefan Kluge","author_inst":"Department for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Guelsah Gabriel","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology; University for Veterinary Medicine, Hanno"},{"author_name":"Casey J Kim","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Anna Wing","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Michael Mayer","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ruth-Anne Pai","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sarah Frankl","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20091652","rel_title":"Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 positive and complicated COVID-19 patient cohorts in Israel: A comparative analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20091652","rel_abs":"Reliably identifying patients at increased risk for COVID-19 complications could guide clinical decisions, public health policies, and preparedness efforts. To date, the most globally accepted definitions of at-risk patients rely, primarily, on epidemiological characterization of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, such characterization overlooks, and fails to correct for, the prevalence of existing conditions in the wider SARS-CoV-2 positive population. Here, we analyze the complete medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (N=4,353) in a large Israeli health organization (representing a population of 2.3 million people), of whom 173 experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, to identify the conditions that increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata. Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications, as previously reported. Interestingly, it also indicates that depression (e.g., odds ratio, OR, for males 65 years or older: 2.94, 95% confidence intervals [1.55, 5.58]; P-value = 0.014) as well cognitive and neurological disorder (e.g., OR for individuals [&ge;] 65 year old: 2.65 [1.69, 4.17]; P-value < 0.001) are significant risk factors; and that smoking and background of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. Adjusting existing risk definitions following these observations may improve their accuracy and impact the global pandemic containment efforts.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen Yanover","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Barak Mizrahi","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nir Kalkstein","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Karni Marcus","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Pinchas Akiva","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yael Barer","author_inst":"Maccabi Institute for Research & Innovation"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Maccabi Institute for Research & Innovation"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Chodick","author_inst":"Maccabi Institute for Research & Innovation"},{"author_name":"Gregory Esper","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Majersik","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Jens Aberle","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Stefan Kluge","author_inst":"Department for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Guelsah Gabriel","author_inst":"Department for Viral Zoonoses-One Health at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology; University for Veterinary Medicine, Hanno"},{"author_name":"Casey J Kim","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Anna Wing","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Michael Mayer","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ruth-Anne Pai","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sarah Frankl","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20077610","rel_title":"Celebrex adjuvant therapy on COVID-19: An experimental study","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20077610","rel_abs":"Background: The world is under serious threat with the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on analyses of available data, we deduced that the excessive prostaglandins E2 (PGE2) accumulation mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was the key pathological basis of COVID-19. Methods: The urine PGE2 levels were measured by mass spectrometry. An experimental study about Celebrex to treat COVID-19 was conducted based on routine treatment. A total of 44 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled (Experimental group n=37, Control group n=7). Patients in experimental group were given Celebrex once or twice a day (0.2 g\/time) for 7-14 days. The dosage or duration was modified for individuals. Clinical outcomes of Celebrex adjuvant therapy were evaluated by vital signs, laboratory tests, and computed tomography upon the discontinuance of Celebrex. Results: We found that the concentrations of PGE2 in urine samples of COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than that of healthy individuals (mean value is 170 ng\/ml vs 18.8 ng\/ml, p<0.01) and positively correlated with the progression of COVID-19. Among the experimental group (ordinary n=29, severe n=7, critical n=1), 25 cases were treated with full dose and 11 cases with half dose of Celebrex, and 1 case with Ibuprofen. The remission rate were 100%, 82% and 57% in full dose, half dose and control group respectively. Celebrex significantly reduced the PGE2 levels and promoted recovery of ordinary or severe COVID-19. Conclusion: Our study suggests that Celebrex adjuvant treatment may be helpful for the therapy of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenxin Hong","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Kai You","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Shenglin Tan","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Feima Wu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China"},{"author_name":"Jiawang Tao","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Xudan Chen","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaye Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Xiong","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Yuan","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Zhen Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Tingting Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Xinwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Peng","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Qiang Tai","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Fuchun Zhang","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Yinxiong Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20084087","rel_title":"Concerns about disease management and psychological stress in SAPHO patients during the COVID-19 epidemic","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20084087","rel_abs":"Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic brings potentially impact on the care of patients with rheumatic diseases, including SAPHO syndrome. We aimed to investigate the disease status, concerns about management, and psychological stress in SAPHO patients during the COVID-19 epidemic. Method A structured questionnaire was distributed online to patients with SAPHO syndrome enrolled in a Chinese cohort study on March 3rd, 2020. Patients were ask about the current treatments, disease status, and concerns about disease management during the epidemic. Psychologic stress (scored from 0 to 10 points) and psychological problems were reported by the patients. Results A total of 157 patients (mean age 38.4 {+\/-} 12.3 years, 66.9% females) were included in the study. None of the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Sixty-five (41.4%) patients worried about their disease conditions during the epidemic with concerns including medication shortage (73.8%), delay of consultation (46.2%), and disease aggravation (61.5%). Sixty-seven (42.7%) patients had medication withdrawal or dose reduction due to lack of drugs, irregular daily schedule or subjective reasons. The most common psychological problems reported was little interest or pleasure in doing things (66.2%). Patients with progressive disease condition were more distressed and disturbed by the epidemic. Patients with nail involvement felt more worried about their disease conditions than patients without (59.6% vs 31.0%, p =0. 001). Conclusions The COVID-19 epidemic imposes a negative impact on the disease management and psychological stress in SAPHO patients. Patients' access to specialty care and medication well as mental stress is of great concern.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuo Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xinyu Lu","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yihan Cao","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yueting Li","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chen Li","author_inst":"Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xudan Chen","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaye Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Xiong","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Yuan","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Zhen Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Tingting Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Xinwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Peng","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Qiang Tai","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Fuchun Zhang","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Yinxiong Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"rheumatology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20090225","rel_title":"Anxiety among the general population during Coronavirus-19 Disease in Saudi Arabia: Implications for a Mental Support Program","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20090225","rel_abs":"Background: The 2019 outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an worldwide health emergency that threatens mental health of general public.

Syria protracted conflict has strained its health systems and caused fragmentation. In this study, we focus on northwest (NW) Syria, where recent violence has driven almost one million civilians (of the 4.17 million in the area) from their homes between December 2019 and March 2020. The area is challenged by overcrowding, inadequate WASH, shelter and insufficient healthcare services. Internationally promoted measures (social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine, lockdown) are not impossible. We model outcomes, according to three scenarios, should there be a COVD-19 outbreak. We aim to: 1. Predict the numbers of cases, including severe and critical ones, and deaths. 2. Identify critical time points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed due to COVID-19. Methodology: using the WHO COVD-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool (COVID-ESFT) and data from the Health Information System Unit on population and health facility capacity and utilization in northwest Syria, we generate predicted numbers of cases, deaths and health care needs according to three scenarios. Scenario One assumes a medium doubling rate (every 4 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Scenario Two assumes a fast doubling rate (every 3.2 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Camp-population Scenario assumes a very fast doubling rate (every 2.3 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Scenarios One and Two apply to the total population of 4.17 million and for 8 weeks from the first case while Camp-population Scenario applies only to the 1.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps and tented settlements and for 6 weeks from the first case. For each scenario, we identify critical time-points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed assuming a highly conservative estimate that 50% of regular hospital (ward) and ICU beds can be occupied by COVID-19 patients. Results: Scenario One predicts 16,384 cases (0.4% of the total population), of which 2,458 are severe and 819 are critical, and 978 deaths in the first 8 weeks. Scenario Two predicts 185,364 cases (4.4% of the population), of which 27805 are severe and 9268 are critical, and 11,066 deaths in the first 8 weeks. Camp-population Scenario predicts 240,000 cases (20% of the IDP population) of which 36,000 are severe and 12,000 are critical and 14,328 deaths in the first 6 weeks. With only 2,429 inpatient beds and 240 ICU beds (98 with adult ventilators, 62 with paediatric ventilators) in northwest Syria, ward and ICU bed capacities will be overwhelmed within 4-7 weeks. The Camp-population Scenario will see the earliest critical time-points. Conclusion and recommendations: Should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in NW Syria, projected cases and deaths will be particularly severe among IDPs. Health system capacity will be overwhelmed within a short period after the first case in camp settings. There is need for further research to account for additional variables that can impact projections. However, it is urgent for international community to mobilize efforts and resources to support community-based measures, increase testing, strengthen health system capacity.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahmoud Hariri","author_inst":"Health Information System Unit NW Syria"},{"author_name":"Hazem Rihawi","author_inst":"Independent Public health expert"},{"author_name":"Salah Safadi","author_inst":"Idependent Public Health Expert"},{"author_name":"Mary Ana McGlasson","author_inst":"Independent Public Health Expert"},{"author_name":"Wael Obaid","author_inst":"health Information System Unit NW Syria"},{"author_name":"Zainab Shafie","author_inst":"Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA)"},{"author_name":"Xudan Chen","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaye Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Xiong","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Yuan","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Zhen Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Tingting Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Xinwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Peng","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Qiang Tai","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Fuchun Zhang","author_inst":"The Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Yinxiong Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20088393","rel_title":"Early detection of severe COVID-19 disease patterns define near real-time personalised care, bioseverity in males, and decelerating mortality rates.","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20088393","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a global health emergency. Recent data indicate a 50% mortality rate across UK intensive care units. METHODS: A single institution, two-centre retrospective analysis following implementation of a Decision Support tool and real-time data dashboard for early detection of patients requiring personalised enhanced care, focussing particularly on respiratory rate, diastolic blood pressure, oxygenation indices, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and ferritin. Protocols differing from conventional practice included high-dose prophylactic anticoagulation for all COVID-19 positive patients and antioxidant prescription. RESULTS: By 22nd April 2020, 923 patients tested COVID-19 positive. 569 patients (61.7%) were male. The majority presented with advanced disease: interquartile ranges were C-reactive protein 44.9-179mg\/L, D-dimer 1070-3802ng\/L, and ferritin 261-1208g\/L. Completed case fatality rates were 25.1% [95% CI 20.0, 30.0] in females, 40.5% [95% CI 35.9, 45.0] in males. 139 patients were admitted to intensive care where current death rates are 16.2% [95% CI 3.8, 28.7] in females, 38.2% [95% CI 28.6, 47.8] in males with no trends for differences based on ethnicity. A real-time traffic lights dashboard enabled rapid assessment of patients using critical parameters to accelerate adjustments to management protocols. In total 513 (55.6%) of patients were flagged as high risk for thromboembolic disease, exceeding the numbers flagged for respiratory deteriorations (N=391, 42.4%), or cytokine storm (N=68, 7.4%). There was minimal evidence that age was associated with disease severity, but males had higher levels of all dashboard indices, particularly C-reactive protein and ferritin (p<0.0001) which displayed no relationship with age. CONCLUSIONS: Survival rates are encouraging. Protocols employed (traffic light-driven personalised care, protocolised early therapeutic anticoagulation based on D-dimer >1,000ng\/L and\/or CRP>200 mg\/L, personalised ventilatory strategies and antioxidants) are recommended to other units. Males are at greater risk of severe disease, most likely as the obligate SARS-CoV-2 receptor is on the X-chromosome, and require especially close, and early attention.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcela P Vizcaychipi","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Claire L Shovlin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Suveer Singh","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Linsey Christie","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Roger Davies","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher Lockie","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alice Howard","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alexander Brown","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex McCarthy","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Monica Popescu","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Amandeep Gupta","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"James Armstrong","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Hisham Said","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Timothy Peters","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard T Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"ChelWest COVID-19 Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20092981","rel_title":"How many COVID-19 cases could have been prevented in the US if its interventions were as effective as those in China and South Korea?","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20092981","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to take measures to contain the spread of the disease; however, the effects have varied significantly from one country to another contingent on governments' responses. Countries that have flattened their coronavirus curves prove that interventions can bring COVID-19 under control. These achievements hold lessons, such as the strict social distancing and coordinated efforts of all government levels in China and massive testing in South Korea, for other countries battling the coronavirus around the world. In this work, we attempt to estimate how many COVID-19 cases could have been prevented in the United States (US) when compared with the US's actual number of cases assuming that on a certain date, the US took China-like or South Korea-like interventions and that these interventions would have been as effective in the US as in China and South Korea. We found that if that date was at the early stage of the outbreak (March 10), more than 99% (1.15 million) fewer infected cases could be expected by the end of the epidemic. This number decreases to 66.03% and 73.06% fewer infected cases with the China-like scenario and the South Korea-like scenario, respectively, if actions were taken on April 1, highlighting the need to respond quickly and effectively to fight the virus. Furthermore, we found that although interventions in both China and South Korea allowed the COVID-19 outbreak to be managed, the epidemic could still oscillate without strict large-scale lockdown measures, as shown in South Korea. Our results demonstrate that early effective interventions can save considerably more people from infection and provide a worldwide alert regard the need for swift response.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kai Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yukun Song","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Menghui Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Science and Technology Information"},{"author_name":"Zhesi Shen","author_inst":"National Science Library"},{"author_name":"Ming Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Jinshan Wu","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Roger Davies","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher Lockie","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alice Howard","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alexander Brown","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex McCarthy","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Monica Popescu","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Amandeep Gupta","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"James Armstrong","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Hisham Said","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Timothy Peters","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard T Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"ChelWest COVID-19 Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20092775","rel_title":"Monitoring the Covid-19 epidemics in Italy from mortality data","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20092775","rel_abs":"The mortality data can be used as an alternative source to monitor the status of Covid-19.

The survey reveals the role of collective housing in relation to viral transmission within centres.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tran Duc Anh Ly","author_inst":"IHU Mediteranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Van Thuan Hoang","author_inst":"IHU Mediteranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Ndiaw Goumballa","author_inst":"IHU Mediteranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Meriem Louni","author_inst":"IHU Mediteranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Naomie Canard","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Thi Loi Dao","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Hacene Medkour","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Audrey Borg","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bardy","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Vera Esteves-Vieira","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Veronique Filosa","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard Davoust","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Oleg Mediannikov","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Edouard Fournier","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier Raoult","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe Gautret","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranne Infection"},{"author_name":"Richard T Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"ChelWest COVID-19 Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20092353","rel_title":"Social Distancing is Effective at Mitigating COVID-19 Transmission in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20092353","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is present in every state and over 90 percent of all counties in the United States. Decentralized government efforts to reduce spread, combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the U.S. is a challenge. We generate a novel metric to represent social distancing behavior derived from mobile phone data, and examine its relationship with COVID-19 case reports at the county level. Our analysis reveals that social distancing is strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the 25 most affected counties in the United States, with a lag period consistent with the incubation time of SARS-CoV-2. We also demonstrate evidence that social distancing was already under way in many U.S. counties before county and state-level policies were implemented. This study strongly supports social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the United States.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hamada Badr","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Hongru Du","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Max Marshall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Ensheng Dong","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Marietta Squire","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Lauren Marie Gardner","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Hacene Medkour","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Audrey Borg","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bardy","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Vera Esteves-Vieira","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Veronique Filosa","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard Davoust","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Oleg Mediannikov","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Edouard Fournier","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier Raoult","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe Gautret","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranne Infection"},{"author_name":"Richard T Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"ChelWest COVID-19 Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20091272","rel_title":"Spread of Covid-19 in the United States is controlled","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20091272","rel_abs":"As of May 1, 2020, the number of cases of Covid-19 in the US passed 1,062,446, interventions to slow down the spread of Covid-19 curtailed most social activities. Meanwhile, an economic crisis and resistance to the strict intervention measures are rising. Some researchers proposed intermittent social distancing that may drive the outbreak of Covid-19 into 2022. Questions arise about whether we should maintain or relax quarantine measures. We developed novel artificial intelligence and causal inference integrated methods for real-time prediction and control of nonlinear epidemic systems. We estimated that the peak time of the Covid-19 in the US would be April 24, 2020 and its outbreak in the US will be over by the end of July and reach 1,551,901 cases. We evaluated the impact of relaxing the current interventions for reopening economy on the spread of Covid-19. We provide tools for balancing the risks of workers and reopening economy.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zixin Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiyang Ge","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shudi Li","author_inst":"Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Tao Xu","author_inst":"Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Eric Boerwinkle","author_inst":"Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Momiao Xiong","author_inst":"Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Audrey Borg","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bardy","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Vera Esteves-Vieira","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Veronique Filosa","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard Davoust","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Oleg Mediannikov","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Edouard Fournier","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier Raoult","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe Gautret","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranne Infection"},{"author_name":"Richard T Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"ChelWest COVID-19 Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Megan Fisher","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"James Germi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Keyser","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip Angelides","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Amurthur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jiang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Rozena Rasheed","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eric Rodriguez-Lopez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Napier","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Martins","author_inst":"Medidata Solutions"},{"author_name":"Stephen Bambury","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Karen Gunderson","author_inst":"CAAcure"},{"author_name":"Nick Goodyear","author_inst":"Castleman Disease Collaborative Network"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mackay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sheila K Pierson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
