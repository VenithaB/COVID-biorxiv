This virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as the cellular entry receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID19, we determined whether ACE2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking. Methods: Using RNAseq, we determined gene expression levels in bronchial epithelia obtained from cytologic brushings of 6th to 8th generation airways in individuals with and without COPD. We externally validated these results from two additional independent cohorts, which used microarray technologies to measure gene expression levels from 6th to 12th generation airways. Results: In the discovery cohort (n=42 participants), we found that ACE2 expression levels were increased by 48% in the airways of COPD compared with non-COPD subjects (COPD=2.52 (0.66) log2 counts per million reads (CPM) versus non-COPD= 1.70 (0.51) CPM , p=.000762). There was a significant inverse relationship between ACE2 gene expression and FEV1% of predicted (r=negative 0.24; p=0.035). Current smoking also significantly increased ACE2 expression levels compared with never smokers (never current smokers=2.77 (90.91) CPM versus smokers=1.78 (0.39) CPM, p=0.024). These findings were replicated in the two external cohorts. Conclusions: ACE2 expression in lower airways is increased in patients with COPD and with current smoking. These data suggest that these two subgroups are at increased risk of serious COVID19 infection and highlight the importance of smoking cessation in reducing the risk.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janice M Leung","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Chen Xi Yang","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Anthony Tam","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Tawimas Shaipanich","author_inst":"Department of Medicine (Division of Respirology), University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Tillie L Hackett","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia, Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Gurpreet K Singhera","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Delbert R Dorscheid","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Don D Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.19.20038364","rel_title":"Supervised Machine Learning for the Early Prediction of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.19.20038364","rel_abs":"Purpose: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious respiratory condition with high mortality and associated morbidity.

The aim of this research is to provide a high-resolution global model of the pandemic that overcomes the problem of biased country-level data on the number of infected cases. To achieve this we propose a novel SIR-type metapopulation transmission model and a set of analytically derived model parameters. We used them to perform a simulation of the disease spread with help of the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEAM) framework embedding actual population densities, commute patterns and long-range travel networks. The simulation starts on Nov 17th, 2019 with just a single pre-symptomatic, yet infectious, case in Wuhan, China, and results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 154 days in multiple countries across five continents. In addition, the model outcome shows high compliance with the results of a random screening test conducted on pregnant women in the New York area. Method: We have built a modified SIR metapopulation transmission model and parameterized it analytically either by setting the values of the parameters based on the literature, or by assuming their plausible values. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in twenty selected countries which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken Non-Drug Interventions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions are in agreement with the empirical data. Results: The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, 4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. Discussion: Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marlena M Siwiak","author_inst":"Data 3.0"},{"author_name":"Pawel Szczesny","author_inst":"Data 3.0"},{"author_name":"Marian P Siwiak","author_inst":"Data 3.0"},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nosocomial Infection, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Wenming Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng Infectious Diseases Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Guijie Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng Infectious Diseases Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuli Zou","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Tian","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Tingfang Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Junmin Xing","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Han","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, The Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of TCM, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Ning","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.20.20038422","rel_title":"Estimating the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Iran using epidemic modeling","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.20.20038422","rel_abs":"Background: As reported by Iranian governments, the first cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections confirmed in Qom, Iran on February 19, 2020 (30 Bahman 1398).

This study aimed to fit an epidemic model to the reported cases data to estimate the basic reproduction number (R_0) of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: We used data from February 21, 2020, to April 21, 2020, on the number of cases reported by Iranian governments and we employed the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) epidemic spreading model to fit the transmission model to the reported cases data by tuning the parameters in order to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Iran. Results: The value of reproduction number was estimated 4.86 in the first week and 4.5 in the second week. it decreased from 4.29 to 2.37 in the next four weeks. At the seventh week of the outbreak the reproduction number was reduced below 1. Conclusions: The results indicate that the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was significantly larger than one in the early stages of the outbreak. However, implementing social distancing and preventing travelling on Nowruz (Persian New Year) effectively reduced the reproduction number. Although the results indicate that reproduction number is below one, it is necessary to continue social distancing and control travelling to prevent causing a second wave of outbreak.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ebrahim Sahafizadeh","author_inst":"Payame Noor University"},{"author_name":"Samaneh Sartoli","author_inst":"Payame Noor University"},{"author_name":"Marian P Siwiak","author_inst":"Data 3.0"},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nosocomial Infection, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Wenming Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng Infectious Diseases Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Guijie Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng Infectious Diseases Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuli Zou","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Tian","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Tingfang Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Junmin Xing","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Han","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, The Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of TCM, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Ning","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.19.20038315","rel_title":"Association between Clinical, Laboratory and CT Characteristics and RT-PCR Results in the Follow-up of COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.19.20038315","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: Since December 2019, more than 100,000 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been confirmed globally based on positive viral nucleic acids with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the association between clinical, laboratory and CT characteristics and RT-PCR results is still unclear. We sought to examine this association in detail, especially in recovered patients. Methods: We analysed data from 52 confirmed patients who had been discharged with COVID-19. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were dynamically recorded and compared with the admission and follow-up RT-PCR results. Results: In this cohort, 52 admitted COVID-19 patients who had confirmed positive RT-PCR results were discharged after 2 rounds of consecutively negative RT-PCR results. Compared with admission levels, CRP levels (median 4.93 mg\/L [IQR: 1.78-10.20]) decreased significantly (p<0.001). and lymphocyte counts (median 1.50x109\/L [IQR: 1.11-1.88]) increased obviously after obtaining negative RT-PCR results (p<0.001). Additionally, substantially improved inflammatory exudation was observed on chest CT except for 2 progressed patients. At the two-week follow-up after discharge, 7 patients had re-positive RT-PCR results, including the abovementioned 2 progressed patients. Among the 7 patients, new GGO was demonstrated in 2 patients. There were no significant differences in CPR levels or lymphocyte counts when comparing the negative and re-positive PCT results (all p >0.05). Conclusion: Heterogeneity between CT features and RT-PCR results was found in COVID-19, especially in some recovered patients with negative RT-PCR results. Our study highlights that both RT-PCR and chest CT should be considered as the key determinants for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hang Fu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"},{"author_name":"Huayan Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"},{"author_name":"Na Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu, Cheng Du, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Xu","author_inst":"Department of Ultrasonography, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenlin Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Huizhu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"},{"author_name":"Rong Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"},{"author_name":"Ran Sun","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"},{"author_name":"Lingyi Wen","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"},{"author_name":"Linjun Xie","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"},{"author_name":"Kun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"},{"author_name":"Chuan Fu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"},{"author_name":"Keke Hou","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu, Cheng Du, China"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Yang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu, Cheng Du, China"},{"author_name":"Yingkun Guo Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.19.20038539","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Hainan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.19.20038539","rel_abs":"Background: Since January 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has spread rapidly and developing the pandemic model around the world.

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data. Results: Of 168 patients, 160 have been discharged, 6 have died and 2 remain hospitalized. The median age was 51.0 years and 51.8% were females. 129 (76.8%) patients were imported cases, and 118 (70.2%), 51 (30.4%) and 52 (31%) of patients lived in Wuhan or traveled to Wuhan, had contact with Covid-19 patients, or had contact with Wuhan residents, respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (65.5%), dry cough (48.8%) and expectoration (32.1%). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (60.2%).

Conclusions: In light of the rapid spread of Covid-19 around the world, early diagnosis and quarantine is important to curb the spread of Covid-19 and intensive treatments in early stage is to prevent patients away from critical condition.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shijiao Yan","author_inst":"Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xingyue Song","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Zhu","author_inst":"the First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaozhi Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"The second naval hospital of southern theater command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Jianwen Ruan","author_inst":"Haikou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Changfeng Lin","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Hainan Province"},{"author_name":"Xiaoran Liu","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Wu","author_inst":"Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhiqian Luo","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenning Fu","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Song Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Yuan","author_inst":"Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shengxing Liu","author_inst":"Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinjian Yao","author_inst":"Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chuanzhu Lv","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.19.20039008","rel_title":"Effectiveness and safety of antiviral or antibody treatments for coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.19.20039008","rel_abs":"Background: To identify safe and effective medical countermeasures (e.g., antivirals\/antibodies) to address the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org\/medrxiv.org; additional searches for ongoing trials and unpublished studies were conducted in clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON). Title\/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers. Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, seven retrospective medical record\/database studies, and 34 case reports or series. These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The most common treatment was ribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination of lopinavir\/ritonavir (n=7). Additional therapies included broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30), steroids (n=39) or various interferons (n=12). No eligible studies examining monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 were identified. One trial found that ribavirin prophylactic treatment statistically significantly reduced risk of MERS infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. Of the 21 studies reporting rates of ICU admission in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, none reported statistically significant results in favour of or against antiviral therapies. Of the 40 studies reporting mortality rates in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, one cohort study (MERS) and one retrospective study (SARS) found a statistically significant increase in the mortality rate for patients treated with ribavirin. Eighteen studies reported potential drug-related adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin. Conclusion: The current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapies for coronavirus is inconclusive and suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials or observational studies, preventing any treatment recommendations from being made. However, it is clear that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards ribavirin (41\/54 studies), which has not shown conclusive evidence of effectiveness and may cause harmful adverse events so future investigations may consider focusing on other candidates for antiviral therapy.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patricia Rios","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Research Institute, Knowledge Translation Program, St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amruta Radhakrishnan","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Research Institute, Knowledge Translation Program, St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Jesmin Antony","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Research Institute, Knowledge Translation Program, St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sonia M.

In continuously updated epidemic curves, case numbers for the most recent epidemic week or day usually appear to be lower than the previous, suggesting a decline of the epidemic. In reality, the epidemic curve may still be on the rise, because reporting delay prevents the most recent cases to appear in the case count. In context of the COVID-19 epidemic and for countries planning large international gatherings, such as the Summer Olympic Games in Japan 2020, the ability to assess the actual stage of an epidemic is of outmost importance. Methods We applied now-casting onto COVID-19 data provided by the nCoV-2019 Data Working Group to evaluate the .true count of cases, by taking into account reporting delays occurring between date of symptom onset and date of confirmation. Findings We calculated a decrease of reporting delay, from a median delay of ten days in calendar week four 2020 to six days in calendar week eight, resulting in an overall mean of 4.3 days. The confidence intervals of the now-casting indicated an increase of cases in the last reporting days, while case country in that same time period suggested a decline.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 8, 2020 were investigated and the prediction was made until March 29, 2020. Methods: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and time-dependent mortality rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. Findings: On average, 925 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases. Conclusion: The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bushra Zareie","author_inst":"Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Amin Roshani","author_inst":"Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Mansournia","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Aziz Rasouli","author_inst":"Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran"},{"author_name":"Ghobad Moradi","author_inst":"Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sharon E.

To curb transmission many countries have adopted social distancing measures and travel restrictions. Estimating the effect of these measures in each context is challenging and requires mathematical models of the transmission dynamics. Projections for the future course of the epidemic strongly rely on model predictions and accurate representation of real-time data as they accumulate. Here I develop an SEIR modeling framework for Covid-19, to evaluate reported cases and fatalities, and to enable forecasting using evidence-based Bayesian parameter estimation. This Bayesian framework offers a tool to parametrize real-time dynamics of Covid-19 cases, and explore the effect of control as it unfolds in any setting. I apply the model to Covid-19 data from Albania, where drastic control measures were put in place already on the day of the first confirmed case. Evaluating the dynamics of reported cases 9-31 March 2020, I estimate parameters and make preliminary projections. Three weeks into the measures, Albanian data already indicate a strong signature of more than 40% transmission reduction, and lend support to a progressively increasing effect of control measures rather than a static one. In the Albanian setting, the model and data match well, projecting the peak of the outbreak may be around 5-15 April, and be contained within 300 active confirmed cases if control continues with the same trend. This framework can be used to understand the quantitative effects of different control measures in real-time, and inform adaptive intervention for success in other settings.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erida Gjini","author_inst":"Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia"},{"author_name":"Amin Roshani","author_inst":"Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Mansournia","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Aziz Rasouli","author_inst":"Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran"},{"author_name":"Ghobad Moradi","author_inst":"Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sharon E.

Given the lack of both specific drugs and an efficient preventive vaccine, the expectation that SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate might decrease in temperate regions during summer, dominated the social scene. Here, we attempted a prediction of the worldwide spread of the infections based on climatic data, expressed by 19 bioclimatic variables. The calculated probability maps shown that potential areas of infection follow a shift from the Tropical to Temperate and Mediterranean Bioclimatic regions, and back to the Tropics again. Maps show an increased probability of infections in Europe, followed by an expansion covering areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as Eastern coastal areas of North America, South-Eastern coastal areas of Latin America and two areas of Southern Australia, and later return to areas of Southeastern Asia, in a manner similar to that of influenza strains (H3N2). Our approach may therefore be of value for the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an optimistic scenario of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks, like other viral respiratory diseases. Consequently, we suggest the incorporation of a climatic impact in the design and implementation of public health policies.

Interventions: Screening and management of patients using a hospital-specific protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal protocols. Results: Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as having fever plus respiratory signs with\/without a history of exposure and were tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our hospital lab using RT PCR. Forty-five of these 73 people were subsequently excluded based on one negative RT PCR result plus positive results to quick screening tests for flu or other respiratory viruses. The remaining 28 people received a second RT PCR test 24 h later. Three people were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two consecutive positive RT PCR tests whilst 25 people were excluded based on two consecutive negative tests. The three COVID-19 confirmed cases received non-critical care. There were no new infections of medical staff or new infections of other hospital inpatients. Conclusions: All three cases were detected as a result of vigilant monitoring of hospital visitors. Whilst screening out-patients presenting to a fever clinic remains important, monitoring visitors must not be overlooked.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Pu","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yujun Xu","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Gordon S.

Hence, it is crucial to identify patient early deterioration to optimize treatment strategy. To this end, we develop an early-warning system with deep learning techniques to predict COVID-19 malignant progression.

Therefore, it makes sense to search for a potential biomarker that could rapidly and effectively identify severe cases early. Clinical samples from 28 cases of COVID-19 (8 severe cases, 20 mild cases) in Zunyi District from January 29, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were collected and otherwise statistically analysed for biochemical markers. Serum urea, creatinine (CREA) and cystatin C (CysC) concentrations in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.001), and there were also significant differences in serum direct bilirubin (DBIL), cholinesterase (CHE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). Serum urea, CREA, CysC, DBIL, CHE and LDH could be used to distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from mild COVID-19 cases. In particular, serum biomarkers, including urea, CREA, CysC, which reflect glomerular filtration function, may have some significance as potential indicators for the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19 and to distinguish it from mild COVID-19. Glomerular filtration function injury in severe COVID-19 patients should also be considered by clinicians.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"JIANLIN XIANG","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Guizhou, China."},{"author_name":"JING WEN","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Guizhou, China."},{"author_name":"XIAOQING YUAN","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Fourth People's Hospital of Zunyi city, Guizhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shun Xiong","author_inst":"School of Laboratory Medicine, Zunyi Medical University, Guizhou, China."},{"author_name":"XUE ZHOU","author_inst":"School of Laboratory Medicine, Zunyi Medical University, Guizhou, China."},{"author_name":"CHANGJIN LIU","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"XUN MIN","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Guizhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xudong Xie","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chunhua Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Changzheng Zhang","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Liu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Weiwei Chen","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiang Bai","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Philip H.S.

This novel virus is thought to have originated from an animal reservoir, and acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. In the wake of a global pandemic it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the origin and spread of a novel infectious disease. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict where these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stability of the viral spike protein and its union with human receptor hACE2. Next, to gain further insights into factors associated with coronaviruses recognition of the human host receptor, we performed modeling studies of five different coronaviruses and their potential binding to hACE2. Modeling results indicate that interfering with the salt bridges at hot spot 353 could be an effective strategy for inhibiting binding, and hence for the prevention of coronavirus infections. We also propose that a glycine residue at the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein can have a critical role in permitting bat variants of the coronaviruses to infect human cells.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vinicio Armijos-Jaramillo","author_inst":"Universidad de Las Americas-Quito"},{"author_name":"Justin Yeager","author_inst":"Universidad de Las Americas-Quito"},{"author_name":"Claire Muslin","author_inst":"Universidad de Las Americas-Quito"},{"author_name":"Yunierkis Perez-Castillo","author_inst":"Universidad de Las Americas-Quito"},{"author_name":"XUE ZHOU","author_inst":"School of Laboratory Medicine, Zunyi Medical University, Guizhou, China."},{"author_name":"CHANGJIN LIU","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"XUN MIN","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Guizhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xudong Xie","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chunhua Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Changzheng Zhang","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Liu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Weiwei Chen","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiang Bai","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Philip H.S.

We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2s entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2s ability to infect humans.

There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and\/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.","rel_num_authors":98,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David E.

Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA complex. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested 19 epitope-HLA-binding prediction tools, and using an in vitro peptide MHC stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC allotypes. In this investigation of potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allotype in question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefore a very challenging task. Here, we present 174 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with high prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 HLA allotypes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a standard assay that includes an RNA extraction step from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab followed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect the purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The current global shortage of RNA extraction kits has caused a severe bottleneck to COVID-19 testing. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected from NP samples via a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step altogether, and tested this hypothesis on a series of blinded clinical samples. The direct RT-qPCR approach correctly identified 92% of NP samples (n = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT-qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Thus, direct RT-qPCR could be a front-line approach to identify the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients, reserving a repeat test with RNA extraction for those individuals with high suspicion of infection but an initial negative result. This strategy would drastically ease supply chokepoints of COVID-19 testing and should be applicable throughout the world.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily A Bruce","author_inst":"The University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Meei-Li Huang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Garrett A Perchetti","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Scott Tighe","author_inst":"The University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Jessica J Hoffman","author_inst":"The University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Pheobe Laaguiby","author_inst":"The University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Diana L Gerrard","author_inst":"The University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Arun Nalla","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Yulun Wei","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alexander L Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Sean A.

We have performed an integrated sequence-based analysis of SARS-CoV2 genomes from different geographical locations in order to identify its unique features absent in SARS-CoV and other related coronavirus family genomes, conferring unique infection, facilitation of transmission, virulence and immunogenic features to the virus. The phylogeny of the genomes yields some interesting results. Systematic gene level mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of the SARS-CoV2 genome, which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C>T)) in the Indian SARS-CoV2, absent in other strains studied here. We have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability, using computational approach. To gain further insights into host responses to viral infection, we predict that antiviral host-miRNAs may be controlling the viral pathogenesis. Our analysis reveals nine host miRNAs which can potentially target SARS-CoV2 genes. Interestingly, the nine miRNAs do not have targets in SARS and MERS genomes. Also, hsa-miR-27b is the only unique miRNA which has a target gene in the Indian SARS-CoV2 genome.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is another deadly virus and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Rapid and early detection of these viruses will facilitate early intervention and reduce disease transmission risk. Here, we present an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed \"AIOD-CRISPR\") assay method for simple, rapid, ultrasensitive, one-pot, and visual detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and HIV virus. In our AIOD CRISPR assay, a pair of crRNAs was introduced to initiate dual CRISPR-Cas12a detection and improve detection sensitivity. The AIOD-CRISPR assay system was successfully utilized to detect nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV with a sensitivity of few copies. Also, it was evaluated by detecting HIV-1 RNA extracted from human plasma samples, achieving a comparable sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR method. Thus, our method has a great potential for developing next-generation point-of-care molecular diagnostics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiong Ding","author_inst":"Univerisity of Connecticut Health Center"},{"author_name":"Kun Yin","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health Center"},{"author_name":"Ziyue Li","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health Center"},{"author_name":"Changchun Liu","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health Center"},{"author_name":"Artur Szczepanski","author_inst":"Microbiology Department, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 7, 30-387 Krakow, Poland."},{"author_name":"Agnieszka Dabrowska","author_inst":"Microbiology Department, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 7, 30-387 Krakow, Poland."},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Owczarek","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 7, 30-387 Krakow, Poland."},{"author_name":"Marek Ochman","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Transplantology, the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases,"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Stacel","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Transplantology, the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases,"},{"author_name":"Zenon Rajfur","author_inst":"Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Sciences, Jagiellonian University, Lojasiewicza 11, 30-348, Krakow, Poland."},{"author_name":"Pawel Piotr Labaj","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 7, 30-387 Krakow, Poland."},{"author_name":"Wojciech Branicki","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 7, 30-387 Krakow, Poland."},{"author_name":"Krzysztof Pyrc","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 7, 30-387 Krakow, Poland."},{"author_name":"Christopher D.

Following unprecedented rapid global spread, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Although data on disease in humans are emerging at a steady pace, certain aspects of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 can only be studied in detail in animal models, where repeated sampling and tissue collection is possible. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 causes respiratory disease in infected rhesus macaques, with disease lasting 8-16 days. Pulmonary infiltrates, a hallmark of human disease, were visible in lung radiographs of all animals. High viral loads were detected in swabs from the nose and throat of all animals as well as in bronchoalveolar lavages; in one animal we observed prolonged rectal shedding. Taken together, the rhesus macaque recapitulates moderate disease observed in the majority of human cases. The establishment of the rhesus macaque as a model of COVID-19 will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and will aid development and testing of medical countermeasures.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Friederike Feldmann","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Neeltje van Doremalen","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez,","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Schultz","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Julie Callison","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Beniah Brumbaugh","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Victoria Avanzato","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Fischer","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"University of WA\/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"The University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Hannes Braberg","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline M.

Comparison of these sequences suggests viral evolution with development of quasispecies. In addition, the present workflow identified a new deletion in nsp2 (Asp268Del) which was found in all 3 samples originating from this cluster as well as in 37 other viruses collected in England and in Netherlands, suggesting the spread of this deletion in Europe. The impact of Asp268Del on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenicity, as well as on PCR performances and anti-viral strategy should be rapidly evaluated in further studies.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonin Bal","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Gregory Destras","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Gaymard","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Maude Bouscambert-Duchamp","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Escuret","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Emilie Frobert","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Genevieve Billaud","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Sophie Trouillet-Assant","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Valerie Cheynet","author_inst":"BioMerieux"},{"author_name":"Karen Brengel-Pesce","author_inst":"BioMerieux"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Fischer","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"University of WA\/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"The University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Hannes Braberg","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline M.

Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic strains (SARS\/MERS\/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that mostly cause mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10) were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets provide new strategies for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edison Ong","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Mei U Wong","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Anthony Huffman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yongqun He","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Escuret","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Emilie Frobert","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Genevieve Billaud","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Sophie Trouillet-Assant","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Valerie Cheynet","author_inst":"BioMerieux"},{"author_name":"Karen Brengel-Pesce","author_inst":"BioMerieux"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Fischer","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"University of WA\/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"The University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Hannes Braberg","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline M.
