Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs. Here, we report a family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC). The potential effectiveness of treating 2019-nCoV by using some existing HIV drugs is also analyzed.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Duc Duy Nguyen","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Kaifu Gao","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Rui Wang","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Guowei Wei","author_inst":"Michigan State University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.03.932350","rel_title":"Machine learning-based analysis of genomes suggests associations between Wuhan 2019-nCoV and bat Betacoronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-02-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.03.932350","rel_abs":"As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (renamed to COVID-19) spread to 30 countries with 2130 deaths and more than 75500 confirmed cases. COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearmans rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gurjit S Randhawa","author_inst":"University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Maximillian P.M.

There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Syed Faraz Ahmed","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ahmed A.

In this study, the structure models of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30) and papain like viral protease (PLVP), were built by homology modeling. Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30 suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shen Lin","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Runnan Shen","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingdong He","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xinhao Li","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xushun Guo","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Lila Kari","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.01.930537","rel_title":"Fast assessment of human receptor-binding capability of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)","rel_date":"2020-02-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.01.930537","rel_abs":"The outbreaks of 2002\/2003 SARS, 2012\/2015 MERS and 2019\/2020 Wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus (CoV) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability, and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiang Huang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Herrmann","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin,"},{"author_name":"Jingdong He","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xinhao Li","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xushun Guo","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Lila Kari","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.31.20019265","rel_title":"Effectiveness of airport screening at detecting travellers infected with 2019-nCoV","rel_date":"2020-02-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.31.20019265","rel_abs":"As the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of China, public health authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening of arrivals at airports.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlie Diamond","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"CMMID nCoV working group","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Funk","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.30.20019844","rel_title":"Early evaluation of the Wuhan City travel restrictions in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak","rel_date":"2020-02-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.30.20019844","rel_abs":"Respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in China during December 2019.

We then apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early Ro estimates are overly confident.

A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the COVID-19 epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed COVID-19 case data. Results: The growth rate of new cases and deaths of COVID-19 were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 853 confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 1 months to 94 years and the average age was (45.05 {+\/-} 17.22) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.12: 1. Conclusions: The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher. The age of COVID-19 patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (60.61%). The harm of the first-generation COVID-19 patients is higher than that of secondary cases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongqiang Zhang","author_inst":"Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fengying Li","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Xianyang"},{"author_name":"Bei Zhang","author_inst":"Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qiling Liu","author_inst":"Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiangwen Li","author_inst":"Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Limei Luo","author_inst":"Shangdong Provincial Maternity and Childcare Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ryo Kinoshita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Nishiura","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Qiqi Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Ben Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Peng Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yimeng Song","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Pai Zheng","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Quanyi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Ottar N Bjornstad","author_inst":"Penn State University"},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Bryan Grenfell","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pybus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.31.928796","rel_title":"Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool for rapid identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes","rel_date":"2020-02-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.31.928796","rel_abs":"SummaryGenome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Ram Beck","author_inst":"Deargen Inc., Daejeon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Bonggun Shin","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States"},{"author_name":"Yoonjung Choi","author_inst":"Deargen, Inc., Daejeon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Sungsoo Park","author_inst":"Deargen, Inc., Daejeon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Keunsoo Kang","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Luiz C.

An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties.

DUBs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. Commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the C-terminal Ub motif or contain Ub coupled to a fluorophore (Z-LRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. By using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) and a defined P2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two DUBs--MERS PLpro and human UCH-L3. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized Ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (ABPs) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the C-terminal Ub motif. Biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates and probes. Using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes Ub and Ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wioletta Rut","author_inst":"Department of Chemical Biology and Bioimaging, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Wyb.

Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program.

This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45\/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arunachalam Ramaiah","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Riley O.

As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.\n\nMethodsWe downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.\n\nResultsAn isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1{middle dot}05 x 10-2 (nucleotide substitutions\/site\/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 x 10-4 to 2.72 x 10-2) for N, 5.34 x 10-3 (5.10 x 10-4, 1.28 x 10-2) for S, 1.69 x 10-3 (3.94 x 10-4, 3.60 x 10-3) for P, 1.65 x 10-3 (4.47 x 10-4, 3.24 x 10-3) for the whole genome, respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs appeared about 0.253-0.594 year before the epidemic.\n\nConclusionOur analysis suggests that at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV are involved in this outbreak that might occur a few months earlier before it was officially reported.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chenglong Xiong","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Lufang Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Microbiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Chen","author_inst":"School of Epidemiology and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"},{"author_name":"Qingwu Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Microbiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"James O.

We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to \"Disease X\" (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%. Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen.
