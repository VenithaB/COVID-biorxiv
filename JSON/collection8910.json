On Feb 20 and 21, 2020, we surveyed 369 adults in 64 cities in China that varied in their rates of confirmed coronavirus cases on their health conditions, distress and life satisfaction. 27% of the participants worked at the office, 38% resorted to working from home, and 25% stopped working due to the outbreak. Those who stopped working reported worse mental and physical health conditions as well as distress. The severity of COVID-19 in a location predicts life satisfaction, and this relationship is contingent upon the existing chronic health issues and hours of exercise of the individuals. Our evidence supports the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epidemiologically, especially for people who stopped working during the outbreak. Our results highlight that physically active people might be more susceptible to wellbeing issues during the lockdown. Policymakers who are considering introducing restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and wellbeing implications.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen X Zhang","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Yifei Wang","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Rauch","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Feng Wei","author_inst":"Tongji University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.15.20035360","rel_title":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection","rel_date":"2020-03-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.15.20035360","rel_abs":"Background\/introduction COVID-19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID-19 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID-19 infection or ICU admission. Results Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID-19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 - 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 - 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 - 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 - 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 - 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 - 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. Conclusions Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vageesh Jain","author_inst":"Institute for Global Health, University College London (UCL), UK; Public Health, London Borough of Hackney, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Jin-Min Yuan","author_inst":"Public Health, London Boroughs of Camden & Islington"},{"author_name":"Andreas Rauch","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Feng Wei","author_inst":"Tongji University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.12.20034678","rel_title":"Ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of 534 cases of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-03-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.12.20034678","rel_abs":"Objective: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is now pandemic all over the world. Previous study has reported several COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis. However, the complete profiling of COVID-19 related ocular symptoms and diseases are still missing. We aim to investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of five hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic findings, and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR from questionnaires and electronic medical records. Results: The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 {+\/-} 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular symptoms. Notably, a total of 332 COVID-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye contact history. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had a history of eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). In consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. Patients, 60.5% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 67.5% in Tongji Hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion was one of the COVID-19 related ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance. It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection, as dirty hand-eye contact might be a high risk factor of COVID-19. Further detailed and comprehensive ophthalmological guidance is needed for COVID-19 control.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liwen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chaohua Deng","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuhui Chen","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xian Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Chen","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huimin Yu","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Qin","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ke Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xufang Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"ophthalmology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.10.20033852","rel_title":"Strongly heterogeneous transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China: local and regional variation","rel_date":"2020-03-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.10.20033852","rel_abs":"Background The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in the city of Wuhan, China, with a period of rapid initial spread. Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low. Interpretation COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low. The COVID-19 epidemic should be controllable with appropriate interventions.

Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild\/moderate, severe\/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial\/viral pneumonia at Shenyang Chest Hospital. Setting: Multi-center study involving three primary care hospitals in Shenyang, China. Participants: 86 suspected COVID-19 cases from participating primary-care hospitals in Shenyang. All 36 SARS-CoV-2 +ve cases (based on RT-PCR assay) were included. Disease severity was assessed using the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6). Mean age, 47 years (range: 25-79), gender ratio, 1:1. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRA) were performed using peripheral blood to determine MTB infection. Main Outcome and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were collected. Comparison of MTB infection status between patients with mild\/moderate and severe\/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: Mean age of 36 COVID-19 patients: 47 (range: 25-79); M\/F: 18\/18; Wuhan\/Hubei connection: 42%. Mild\/moderate cases: 27 (75%); severe\/critical: 9 (25%). MTB infection (IGRA+ve): 13 cases (36.11%), including 7 of 9 severe\/critical cases. MTB infection rate: higher in COVID-19 (36.11%) than bacterial pneumonia (20%; p=0.0047) and viral pneumonia patients (16.13%; p=0.024). MTB infection more common than other co-morbidities (36.11% vs diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%). MTB co-infection linked with disease severity (severe\/critical 78% vs mild\/moderate cases 22%; p=0.0049), and rate of disease progression: infection to development of symptoms (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 6.5+\/-4.2 days vs SARS-COV-2: 8.9+\/-5.2 days; p=0.073); from symptom development to diagnosed as severe (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 3.4+\/-2.0 days vs SARS-COV-2: 7.5+\/-0.5 days; p=0.075). Conclusions and Relevance: MTB infection likely increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, and increases COVID-19 severity, but this requires validation in a larger study. MTB infection status of COVID-19 patients should be checked routinely at hospital admission.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110044, P.R.

Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56  prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56  for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56  for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiumei Hu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University.

We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections. Methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population. Conclusions: The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Iran's situation is highly uncertain with unclear and negative future scenarios, while South Korea is approaching the end of the outbreak. Both Europe and the USA are at early stages of the outbreak, posing significant health and economic risks to the world in absence of serious measures.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ke Wu","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Didier Darcet","author_inst":"Gavekal Intelligence Software"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Didier Sornette","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Zihao Ou","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University.

Our data indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild COVID-19. IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were remarkably up-regulated in patients with severe COVID-19. The levels of IL-2 and IL-6 relative to the length of hospital stay underwent a similar \"rise-decline\" pattern, probably reflecting the therapeutic effect.

Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. Objective To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China. Design A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Setting Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Participants Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major personal protection equipment (PPE). The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 RNAs Results The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects are self-service printers (20.0%), desktop\/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were most contaminated PPE. Conclusions and Relevance Many surfaces were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 across the hospital in various patient care areas, commonly used objects, medical equipment, and PPE. The 13 hospital function zones were classified into four contamination levels. These findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings may have important implications for modifying and developing urgently needed policy to better protect healthcare workers during this ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guangming Ye","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Lin","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liangjun Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shichan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhikun Zeng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shiyu Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Terri Rebmann","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Yirong Li","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenyu Pan","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhonghua Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of wuhan university"},{"author_name":"Fubing Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhengmin Qian","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Xinghuan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Leishengshan Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.11.20034512","rel_title":"A Method to Model Outbreaks of New Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential such as COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.11.20034512","rel_abs":"The emergence of the novel coronavirus (a.k.a. COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) out of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China caught the world by surprise. As the outbreak began to spread outside of China, too little was known about the virus to model its transmission with any acceptable accuracy. World governments responded to rampant misinformation about the virus leading to collateral disasters, such as plunging financial markets, that could have been avoided if better models of the outbreak had been available. This is an engineering approach to model the spread of a new infectious disease from sparse data when little is known about the infectious agent itself. The paper is not so much about the model itself - because there are many good scientific approaches to model an epidemic - as it is about crunching numbers when there are barely any numbers to crunch. The coronavirus outbreak in USA is used to illustrate the implementation of this modeling approach. A Monte Carlo approach is implemented by using incubation period and testing efficiency as variables. Among others it is demonstrated that imposing early travel restrictions from infected countries slowed down the outbreak in the USA by about 26 days.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Willem G Odendaal","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Lin","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liangjun Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shichan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhikun Zeng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shiyu Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Terri Rebmann","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Yirong Li","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenyu Pan","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhonghua Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of wuhan university"},{"author_name":"Fubing Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhengmin Qian","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Xinghuan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Leishengshan Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.11.20031096","rel_title":"Relationship between the ABO Blood Group and the COVID-19 Susceptibility","rel_date":"2020-03-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.11.20031096","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading around the world rapidly and declared as a pandemic by WHO.

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of COVID-19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on January 20-23 and February 11-14. We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R_t), for COVID-19 and influenza A(H1N1). Findings: COVID-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% CI: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates. In the two surveys we estimated that 74.5% and 97.5% of the general adult population wore masks when going out, and 61.3% and 90.2% avoided going to crowded places, respectively. Implications: Containment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of COVID-19. The social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early February 2020. However, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population behaviours as COVID-19 continues to spread globally.

However, to pick out a reliable predictable model\/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now. In this paper, based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces\/cities in China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models\/methods. Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in the choice of the size of dataset in forecasting. Before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamical models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance than SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models on the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine, and a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wuyue Yang","author_inst":"Zhou Pei-Yuan Center for Applied Mathematics, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Dongyan Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute for Scientific and Engineering Computing, College of Applied Sciences, Beijing University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Liangrong Peng","author_inst":"College of Mathematics and Data Science, Minjiang University"},{"author_name":"Changjing Zhuge","author_inst":"Beijing University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Liu Hong","author_inst":"Zhou Pei-Yuan Center for Applied Mathematics, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Min Whui Fong","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Qiuyan Liao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Mike YW Kwan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"So Lun Lee","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Susan S.

Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to 'flatten the curve' of the ongoing epidemics. Evaluation of the impact of government-imposed social distancing and of other measures to control further spread of COVID-19 is urgent, especially because of the large societal and economic impact of the former. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of self-imposed prevention measures and of short-term government-imposed social distancing in mitigating, delaying, or preventing a COVID-19 epidemic. Methods and Findings: We developed a deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in a population stratified by disease status (susceptible, exposed, infectious with mild or severe disease, diagnosed and recovered) and disease awareness status (aware and unaware) due to the spread of COVID-19. Self-imposed measures were assumed to be taken by disease-aware individuals and included handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing. Government-imposed social distancing reduced the contact rate of individuals irrespective of their disease or awareness status. The model was parameterized using current best estimates of key epidemiological parameters from COVID-19 clinical studies. The model outcomes included the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses. For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government-imposed social distancing can only delay the peak (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention). The delay can be even longer and the height of the peak can be additionally reduced if this intervention is combined with self-imposed measures that are continued after government-imposed social distancing has been lifted. Our analyses do not account for stochasticity, demographics, heterogeneities in contact patterns or mixing, spatial effects, imperfect isolation of individuals with severe disease, and reinfection with COVID-19. Conclusions: Our results suggest that information dissemination about COVID-19, which causes individual adaption of handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing can be an effective strategy to mitigate and delay the epidemic. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden. We stress the importance of disease awareness in controlling the ongoing epidemic and recommend that, in addition to policies on social distancing, governments and public health institutions mobilize people to adopt self-imposed measures with proven efficacy in order to successfully tackle COVID-19.

There is no report about the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients untill now. We aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients. Methods In this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. We described and analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020. Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 . Findings Of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger. Only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. In the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with COVID-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case (common type) was confirmed with COVID-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Interpretation While the 392 CML respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much contact with COVID-19 patients during the outbreak. Patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan-Yu Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology Union Shenzhen Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing-Ming Guo","author_inst":"Yi Chang Central People's Hospital, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University"},{"author_name":"Zhuang-Zhi Yang","author_inst":"Suizhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong You","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical college, Huazhong University of science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Chao Chen","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical college, Huazhong University of science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shi-Ming Chen","author_inst":"HuangShi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Cheng","author_inst":"Wuhan NO.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"You-Shan Zhang","author_inst":"The first people hospital of JingZhou"},{"author_name":"Dao-Zi Jiang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xue-Lan Zuo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Jian Zhu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Huang","author_inst":"The first people's Hospital of Xiaogan City"},{"author_name":"Hong-Xiang Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing Li","author_inst":"Wuhan NO.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing Wu","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital,Wuhan Hubei"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Ping Huang","author_inst":"Jingzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qi-Huan Liu","author_inst":"Affiliated Dongfeng Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ying Bao","author_inst":"Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Da-Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Tianmen First People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin-Hua Zhang","author_inst":"The general Hospital of Central Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Zhe Zhao","author_inst":"Minda Hospital of Hubei Minzu University"},{"author_name":"Ren-Ying Ge","author_inst":"Xian Ning Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jie Du","author_inst":"XianTao First People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ya-Ping Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Fifth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hong-Bo Ren","author_inst":"The First People's  Hospital of Jingzhou"},{"author_name":"Hong Han","author_inst":"Liyuan Hospital of TongJi medical college,  Huazhong university of science and technology"},{"author_name":"Yun-Hui Wei","author_inst":"XiangZhou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiang","author_inst":"Enshi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chu-Cheng Wan","author_inst":"Affiliated Taihe Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"You-Fang Zhao","author_inst":"Gezhouba Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"Hubei provincial Hospital of TCM"},{"author_name":"Guo-Lin Yuan","author_inst":"Xiangyang Central Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science"},{"author_name":"Li Meng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei-Ming Li","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical college, Huazhong University of science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.13.991083","rel_title":"Structural and functional conservation of the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift signal of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-03-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.13.991083","rel_abs":"17 years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take over a year to develop a vaccine, the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, and that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablated -1 PRF activity. The upstream attenuator hairpin activity has also been functionally retained. Small-angle x-ray scattering indicated that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 had the same conformation. Finally, a small molecule previously shown to bind the SARS-CoV pseudoknot and inhibit -1 PRF was similarly effective against -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may provide promising lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jamie A.

Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used because of its high sensitivity, typically claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by some RT-PCR methods, probably due to low viral load, timing of sampling, degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or possible mutations spanning the primer binding sites. Therefore, alternative and highly sensitive methods are imperative. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodating various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 343 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrated its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allowed for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. We further amplified the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome from 8 to half a million viral copies purified from 13 COVID-19 positive specimens, and detected mutations through next generation sequencing. Finally, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method in parallel, that required modest sequencing depth for uncovering SARS-CoV-2 mutational diversity and potentially novel or emerging isolates.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chenyu Li","author_inst":"Paragon Genomics Inc., Hayward, CA 94545 USA"},{"author_name":"David N.

The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as SARS-CoV, can reveal the common and\/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system.\n\nHerein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind\/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells.\n\nThe data, sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Filippo Marchetti","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Colombo","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Chong Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Jiayi Liu","author_inst":"Bejing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University."},{"author_name":"Jing Xue","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Qi Lv","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Jiangning Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Pin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Yanfeng Xu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Feifei Qi","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Yajin Qu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Fengdi Li","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Zhiguang Xiang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Haisheng Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Shuran Gong","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Mingya Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Guanpeng Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Shunyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Zhiqi Song","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Yunlin Han","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Linna Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Xing Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Qiang Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences."},{"author_name":"Hang Xiang","author_inst":"Enshi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chu-Cheng Wan","author_inst":"Affiliated Taihe Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"You-Fang Zhao","author_inst":"Gezhouba Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"Hubei provincial Hospital of TCM"},{"author_name":"Guo-Lin Yuan","author_inst":"Xiangyang Central Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science"},{"author_name":"Li Meng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei-Ming Li","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical college, Huazhong University of science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.12.988865","rel_title":"The architecture of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome","rel_date":"2020-03-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.12.988865","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and\/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3' tail. Functional investigation of the unknown ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe provide a high-resolution map of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome using nanopore direct RNA sequencing and DNA nanoball sequencing.\nC_LIO_LIThe transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical.\nC_LIO_LIIn addition to the genomic and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs.\nC_LIO_LIWe discover at least 41 potential RNA modification sites with an AAGAA motif.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dongwan Kim","author_inst":"Institute for Basic Science"},{"author_name":"Joo-Yeon Lee","author_inst":"Korea National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Jeong-Sun Yang","author_inst":"Korea National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Jun Won Kim","author_inst":"Korea National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"V.

A convolutional neural network classifier is first trained on 553 sequences from NGDC, separating the genome of different virus strains from the Coronavirus family with accuracy 98.73%. The networks behavior is then analyzed, to discover sequences used by the model to identify SARS-CoV-2, ultimately uncovering sequences exclusive to it.

Finally, the primer is synthesized and tested on patient samples (n=6 previously tested positive), delivering a sensibility similar to routine diagnostic methods, and 100% specificity. The proposed methodology has a substantial added value over existing methods, as it is able to both identify promising primer sets for a virus from a limited amount of data, and deliver effective results in a minimal amount of time.

The approach is effective in reducing respiratory cell viral replication for H1N1 IAV. Our bioinformatic analysis showed a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses.

SP bound to CD147, a receptor on the host cells, thereby mediating the viral invasion. Our further research confirmed this finding. First, in vitro antiviral tests indicated Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 humanized antibody, significantly inhibited the viruses from invading host cells, with an EC50 of 24.86 g\/mL and IC50 of 15.16 g\/mL. Second, we validated the interaction between CD147 and SP, with an affinity constant of 1.85x10-7M. Co-Immunoprecipitation and ELISA also confirmed the binding of the two proteins. Finally, the localization of CD147 and SP was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells by immuno-electron microscope. Therefore, the discovery of the new route CD147-SP for SARS-CoV-2 invading host cells provides a critical target for development of specific antiviral drugs.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ke Wang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Sen Zhou","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jian-Qi Lian","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Du","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Li Gong","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong-Yong Cui","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie-Jie Geng","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Bin Wang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiu-Xuan Sun","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun-Fu Wang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xu Yang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Lin","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong-Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Ding Wei","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Min Yang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Meng Zhu","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kui Zhang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhao-Hui Zheng","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Lin Miao","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ting Guo","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ying Shi","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Ling Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing-Yi Wang","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huijie Bian","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Zhu","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Nan Chen","author_inst":"Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"Hubei provincial Hospital of TCM"},{"author_name":"Guo-Lin Yuan","author_inst":"Xiangyang Central Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science"},{"author_name":"Li Meng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei-Ming Li","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical college, Huazhong University of science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"}]}
