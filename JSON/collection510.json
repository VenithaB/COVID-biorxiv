Using Microfluidic Antibody Affinity Profiling (MAAP), we determined the aggregate affinities and concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma samples of 42 seropositive individuals, 23 of whom were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2-positive by PCR testing. We found that dissociation constants (Kd) of anti-RBD antibodies spanned more than two orders of magnitude from 80 pM to 25 nM, despite having similar antibody concentrations. Individual patients showed progressively higher antibody concentrations but constant Kd values, suggesting that affinities did not mature over time. 33 sera showed affinities higher than that of the CoV2 spike for its ACE2 receptor. Accordingly, addition of seropositive plasma to pre-formed spike-ACE2 receptor complexes led to their dissociation. Finally, we observed that the RBD of HKU1, OC43, and SARS-CoV coronaviruses, but not unrelated control proteins, were able to compete substantially with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 in solution. Therefore, the affinity of total plasma immunoglobulins to SARS-CoV-2 is an indicator of the quality of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and may help select the most efficacious samples for therapeutic plasmapheresis.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthias M.

Accurate and real time information about epidemiological situation is therefore urgently needed for managing decisions in the countries, regions and municipalities which are affected. Massive testing of viral presence in human saliva, a smear from the nose, nasopharynx and \/ or oropharynx, bronchial lavage water obtained by fibrobronchoscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage), as well as from (endo) tracheal, nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, biopsy or autopsy material of the lungs, whole blood, serum or antibodies presence in blood cannot give relevant information about the COVID-19 infection rate in the community since simultaneous testing of the whole community is not technically possible, the information obtained in testing of specific groups is retarded and, in addition, such testing is expensive. The alternative to mass testing of the population is the testing of wastewater that could contain SARS-CoV-2 particles originating from excreta. Such testing has several limitations connected with the particularities of the testing procedure. In the present study, a modified approach for detection of COVID-19 infection rate using wastewater analysis has been developed. The approach includes i) the creation of a calibration curve on the basis of the serial dilution of excreta collected from people who are infected with COVID-19 and ii) the analysis of wastewater samples and their serial dilutions but the approach excludes usage of concentration techniques before wastewater sample analysis as well as usage of external control in RT-PCR reactions for calculation of numbers of viral particles. The minimum infection rate that can be detected using this approach is 0.01%. The approach developed was used to investigate wastewater from eleven sewage inspection chambers in the city of Kazan (Russia). It was demonstrated that the average infection rate of people using these sewers was over 0.4% in July 2020.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Polina Kuryntseva","author_inst":"Kazan Federal University"},{"author_name":"Kamalya Karamova","author_inst":"Kazan Federal University"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fomin","author_inst":"Kazan Federal University"},{"author_name":"Svetlana Selivanovskaya","author_inst":"Kazan Federal University"},{"author_name":"Polina Galitskaya","author_inst":"Kazan Federal University"},{"author_name":"Ji Ke","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Jun Lv","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Canqing Yu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Dianjianyi Sun","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Quanyi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing Research Center for Preventive Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liming Li","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Heike Fiegler","author_inst":"Fluidic Analytics"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Tuomas P.

In this paper, we examine college reopenings' association with changes in human mobility within campuses and in COVID-19 incidence in the counties of the campuses, over a two-week period before and after college reopenings. To estimate the daily reproduction number (Rt), we used a Bayesian framework. Using a difference-in-differences design comparing areas with a college campus, before and after reopening, to areas without a campus, we find that after college reopenings for face-to-face instruction, COVID-19 incidence in the county increased on average by a statistically significant 0.024 per thousand residents, following increases in mobility on campus. Similarly, we estimated increased transmission locally after reopening, with a rising trend in Rt. The increase in cases was larger in counties with colleges that drew students from areas with increasing incidence rates.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin S Andersen","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Greensboro"},{"author_name":"Ana I Bento","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Anirban Basu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chris Marsicano","author_inst":"Davidson College"},{"author_name":"Kosali Simon","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Ji Ke","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Jun Lv","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Canqing Yu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Dianjianyi Sun","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Quanyi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing Research Center for Preventive Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liming Li","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Heike Fiegler","author_inst":"Fluidic Analytics"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Tuomas P.

However, its impact on neurocognitive, psychiatric health and quality of life (QoL) in survivors after the acute phase is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate neurocognitive function, psychiatric symptoms, and QoL in COVID-19 survivors shortly after hospital discharge. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors followed-up for 2 months after discharge. A battery of standardized instruments evaluating neurocognitive function, psychiatric morbidity, and QoL (mental and physical components) was administered by telephone. Findings: Of the 229 screened patients, 179 were included in the final analysis. Among survivors, the prevalence of moderately impaired immediate verbal memory and learning was 38%, delayed verbal memory (11.8%), verbal fluency (34.6%), and working memory (executive function) (6.1%), respectively. Moreover, 58.7% of patients had neurocognitive impairment in at least one function. Rates of positive screening for anxiety were 29.6%, depression (26.8%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (25.1%) respectively. In addition, 39.1% of the patients had psychiatric morbidity. Low QoL for physical and mental components was detected in 44.1% and 39.1% of patients, respectively. Delirium and stress-related symptoms increased approximately 4-fold the odds of developing neurocognitive impairment. Female gender and neurocognitive impairment diagnosis were related with an increase of 2.5 and 4.56-fold odds respectively of psychiatric morbidity. Interpretation: Hospitalized COVID-19 survivors showed a high prevalence of neurocognitive impairment, psychiatric morbidity, and poor QoL in the short-term. It is uncertain if these impacts persist over the long-term.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raul Mendez","author_inst":"La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital.

Objectives: To assess clinical and weekly laboratory differences in hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to occurrence of PE. Methods: This retrospective study included all consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiography for PE clinical suspicion. Clinical data and median blood test results distributed into weekly periods from COVID-19 symptoms onset were compared between PE and non-PE patients. Results: Ninety-two patients were included, 29 (32%) had PE. PE patients were younger (63.9 (SD13.7) vs 69.9 (SD12.5) years). Clinical symptoms and COVID-19 CT features were similar in both groups. PE was diagnosed after a mean of 20.0 (SD8.6) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Corticosteroid boluses were more frequently used in PE patients (62% vs. 43%). Median values [IQR] of D-dimer in PE vs non-PE patients were: week 2 (2010.7 [770.1-11208.9] vs 626.0 [374.0-2382.2]; p=0.04); 3 (3893.1 [1388.2-6694.0] vs 1184.4 [461.8-2447.8]; p=0.03); and 4 (2736.3 [1202.1-8514.1] vs 1129.1 [542.5-2834.6]; p=0.01).

We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID 19 compatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over 14 days starting in March 2020. Results: We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (78%) or cough (77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11) or hospital care (n=44). 51% (n=28) were female, 49% were age <60.

Bayesian inference network, distance metric learning, and ensemble models discriminated between patients with SARS CoV2 infection and alternate diagnoses with sensitivities of 81.6 to 84.2%, specificities of 58.8 to 70.6%, and accuracies of 61.4 to 71.8%. After integrating imaging and laboratory test statistics with the predictions of the Bayesian inference network, changes in diagnostic uncertainty at each step in the simulated clinical evaluation process were highly sensitive to location, symptom, and diagnostic test choices. Conclusions: Decision support models that incorporate symptoms and available test results can help providers diagnose SARS CoV2 infection in real world settings.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chistopher D'Ambrosia","author_inst":"University of California San Diego, Department of Computer Science and Engineering"},{"author_name":"Henrik Christensen","author_inst":"University of California San Diego, Department of Computer Science and Engineering"},{"author_name":"Eliah Aronoff-Spencer","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Reinshagen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Lage-Rupprecht","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Reagon Karki","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Soeren Lukassen","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Yojana Gadiya","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing"},{"author_name":"Neal Giri Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Sayoni Das","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd."},{"author_name":"Shounak Baksi","author_inst":"Causality BioModels Pvt Ltd"},{"author_name":"Daniel Domingo-Fernandez","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Manuel Lentzen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Mark Strivens","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd."},{"author_name":"Tamara Raschka","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinatl Jr.","author_inst":"Klinikum der Goethe-Universitaet"},{"author_name":"Lauren Nicole DeLong","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Philip Gribbon","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Gerd Geisslinger","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence for Immune Mediated Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk Jr.","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Holger Froehlich","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Peitsch","author_inst":"Philip Morris International"},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.20.20198150","rel_title":"Forecasting daily COVID-19 confirmed, deaths and recovered cases using univariate time series models: A case of Pakistan study","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.20.20198150","rel_abs":"The increasing confirmed cases and death counts of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Pakistan has disturbed not only the health sector, but also all other sectors of the country. For precise policy making, accurate and efficient forecasts of confirmed cases and death counts are important. In this work, we used five different univariate time series models including; Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Nonparametric Autoregressive (NPAR) and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) models for forecasting confirmed, death and recovered cases. These models were applied to Pakistan COVID-19 data, covering the period from 10, March to 3, July 2020. To evaluate models accuracy, computed two standard mean errors such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The findings show that the time series models are useful in predicting COVID-19 confirmed, deaths and recovered cases. Furthermore, MA model outperformed the rest of all models for confirmed and deaths counts prediction, while ARMA is second best model. The SES model seems superior to other models for prediction of recovered counts, however MA is competitive. On the basis of best selected models, we forecast form 4th July to 14th August, 2020, which will be helpful for decision making of public health and other sectors of Pakistan.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasnain Iftikhar","author_inst":"Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Moeeba Iftikhar","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Peshawar, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Eliah Aronoff-Spencer","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Reinshagen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Lage-Rupprecht","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Reagon Karki","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Soeren Lukassen","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Yojana Gadiya","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing"},{"author_name":"Neal Giri Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Sayoni Das","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd."},{"author_name":"Shounak Baksi","author_inst":"Causality BioModels Pvt Ltd"},{"author_name":"Daniel Domingo-Fernandez","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Manuel Lentzen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Mark Strivens","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd."},{"author_name":"Tamara Raschka","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinatl Jr.","author_inst":"Klinikum der Goethe-Universitaet"},{"author_name":"Lauren Nicole DeLong","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Philip Gribbon","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Gerd Geisslinger","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence for Immune Mediated Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk Jr.","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Holger Froehlich","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Peitsch","author_inst":"Philip Morris International"},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.19.20197855","rel_title":"Diagnosis value of SARS-CoV-2 antigen\/antibody combined testing using rapid diagnostic tests at hospital admission","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.19.20197855","rel_abs":"Objectives: The implementation of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may enhance the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 testing, as RDTs are widely accessible and easy to use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a diagnosis strategy based on a combination of antigen and IgM\/IgG serological RDTs. Methods: Plasma and nasopharyngeal samples were collected between 14 March and 11 April 2020 at hospital admission from 45 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and 20 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) was assessed in nasopharyngeal swabs using the Coris Respi-Strip. For IgM\/IgG detection, SureScreen Diagnostics and Szybio Biotech RDTs were used in addition to laboratory assays (Abbott Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Theradiag COVID-19 IgM ELISA). Results: Using the Ag RDT, 13 out of 45 (29.0%) specimens tested positive, the sensitivity was 87.0% for Cycle Threshold (CT) values [&le;] 25 and 0% for CT values > 25. IgG detection was associated with high CT values and the amount of time after the onset of symptoms. The profile of isolated IgM on RDTs was more frequently observed during the first and second week after the onset of symptoms. The combination of Ag and IgM\/IgG RDTs enabled the detection of up to 84.0% of COVID-19 confirmed cases at hospital admission. Conclusion: Antigen and antibody-based RDTs showed suboptimal performances when used alone. However when used in combination, they are able to identify most COVID-19 patients admitted in an emergency department.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Veyrenche","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Karine Bollore","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Amandine Pisoni","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bedin","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Anne-Marie Mondain","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacques Ducos","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michel Segondy","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Montes","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patrick Pastor","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Morquin","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vincent Le Moing","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Philippe Van De Perre","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Edouard Tuaillon","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tamara Raschka","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinatl Jr.","author_inst":"Klinikum der Goethe-Universitaet"},{"author_name":"Lauren Nicole DeLong","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Philip Gribbon","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Gerd Geisslinger","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence for Immune Mediated Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk Jr.","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Holger Froehlich","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Peitsch","author_inst":"Philip Morris International"},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.18.20197319","rel_title":"Uncovering clinical risk factors and prediction of severe COVID-19: A machine learning approach based on UK Biobank data","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.18.20197319","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 is a major public health concern. Given the extent of the pandemic, it is urgent to identify risk factors associated with severe disease. Accurate prediction of those at risk of developing severe infections is also important clinically. Methods: Based on the UK Biobank (UKBB data), we built machine learning(ML) models to predict the risk of developing severe or fatal infections, and to evaluate the major risk factors involved. We first restricted the analysis to infected subjects, then performed analysis at a population level, considering those with no known infections as controls. Hospitalization was used as a proxy for severity. Totally 93 clinical variables (collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreak) covering demographic variables, comorbidities, blood measurements (e.g. hematological\/liver and renal function\/metabolic parameters etc.), anthropometric measures and other risk factors (e.g. smoking\/drinking habits) were included as predictors. XGboost (gradient boosted trees) was used for prediction and predictive performance was assessed by cross-validation. Variable importance was quantified by Shapley values and accuracy gain. Shapley dependency and interaction plots were used to evaluate the pattern of relationship between risk factors and outcomes. Results: A total of 1191 severe and 358 fatal cases were identified. For the analysis among infected individuals (N=1747), our prediction model achieved AUCs of 0.668 and 0.712 for severe and fatal infections respectively. Since only pre-diagnostic clinical data were available, the main objective of this analysis was to identify baseline risk factors. The top five contributing factors for severity were age, waist-hip ratio(WHR), HbA1c, number of drugs taken(cnt_tx) and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. For prediction of mortality, the top features were age, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), urea and WHR. In subsequent analyses involving the whole UKBB population (N for controls=489987), the corresponding AUCs for severity and fatality were 0.669 and 0.749. The same top five risk factors were identified for both outcomes, namely age, cnt_tx, WC, WHR and cystatin C. We also uncovered other features of potential relevance, including testosterone, IGF-1 levels, red cell distribution width (RDW) and lymphocyte percentage. Conclusions: We identified a number of baseline clinical risk factors for severe\/fatal infection by an ML approach. For example, age, central obesity, impaired renal function, multi-comorbidities and cardiometabolic abnormalities may predispose to poorer outcomes. The presented prediction models may be useful at a population level to help identify those susceptible to developing severe\/fatal infections, hence facilitating targeted prevention strategies. Further replications in independent cohorts are required to verify our findings.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth C.Y.

FloRest, a novel 3DP flow restrictor, provides clinicians control of tidal volumes and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), using the 3DP manometer adaptor to monitor pressures. We tested the ventilator splitter circuit in simulation centers between artificial lungs and used an anesthesia gas machine to successfully ventilate two swines. As one of the first studies to demonstrate splitting one anesthesia gas machine between two swines, we present proof-of-concept of a de novo, closed, multiplexing system, with flow restriction for individualized patient therapy.

Consequently, ventilator multiplexing is reserved only as a last emergency resource, by trained clinicians and respiratory therapists with ventilator operative experience.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Helen Xun","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Shallal","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Justin Unger","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Runhan Tao","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Alberto Torres","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Vladimirov","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Frye","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Mohit Singhala","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk Jr.","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Holger Froehlich","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Peitsch","author_inst":"Philip Morris International"},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.19.20198028","rel_title":"An improved method to estimate the effective reproduction number of the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from its application in Greece","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.19.20198028","rel_abs":"Introduction: Monitoring the time-varying effective reproduction number Rt is crucial for assessing the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. We present an improved method to estimate Rt and its application to routine surveillance data from Greece. Methods: Our method extends that of Cori et al (2013), adding Bayesian imputation of missing symptom onset dates, imputation of infection times using an external estimate of the incubation period, and an adjustment for reporting delay. To facilitate its use, we provide an R software package named \"bayEStim\". We applied the method to COVID-19 surveillance data from Greece, and examined the resulting Rt estimates in relation to control measures applied, in order to assess their effectiveness. We also associated Rt, as a measure of transmissibility, to population mobility as recorded in Google data and to ambient temperature. We used a serial interval between 4 and 7.5 days, and a median incubation period of 5.1 days. Results: In Greece Rt fell rapidly as the first control measures were introduced, dropping below 1 at least a week before a full lockdown came into effect. In mid-July Rt started increasing again, as increased mobility associated with tourism activity was observed. Each 10% of increase in relative mobility increased Rt by 8.1% (95% CrI 6.1-10.2%), whereas each unit celsius of temperature increase decreased Rt by 4.6% (95% CrI 5.4-13.7%). Conclusions: Mobility patterns significantly affect Rt. Most of the reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility in Greece occurred already before the lockdown, likely as a result of decreased population mobility. Lower viral transmissibility in summer does not appear sufficient to counterbalance the increased mobility due to tourism. Monitoring Rt is an essential component of COVID-19 surveillance, and it is crucial for correctly assessing the effect of control measures.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theodore Lytras","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Vana Sypsa","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Demosthenes Panagiotakos","author_inst":"School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Alberto Torres","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Vladimirov","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Frye","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Mohit Singhala","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk Jr.","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Holger Froehlich","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Peitsch","author_inst":"Philip Morris International"},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.19.20197996","rel_title":"Quantifying the Effects of Social Distancing on theSpread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.19.20197996","rel_abs":"This paper studies the interplay between the social distancing and the spread of COVID-19 disease, a widely spread pandemic that has affected nearly most of the world population. Starting in China, the virus has reached the United States of America with devastating consequences. Other countries severely affected by the pandemic are Brazil, Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, India, Italy, and France. Even though it is not possible to eliminate the spread of the virus from the world or any other country, it might be possible to reduce its effect by decreasing the number of infected people. Implementing such policies needs a good understanding of the system dynamics, generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with complex and continuous feedback loops. As a result, we use agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis through applying some policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, providing good emergency and hospitalization strategies, and preventing traveling would lead to reducing the infection rates. Based on imperial college modeling studies that prove increasing levels of interventions could slow down the spread of disease and infection cases as much as possible, and taking into account that social distancing policy is considered to be the most important factor that was recommended to follow. Our proposed model is designed to test if increasing the social distancing policies strictness can slow down the spread of disease significantly or not, and find out what is the required safe level of social distancing. So, the model was run six times, with six different percentages of social distancing with keeping the other parameters levels fixed for all experiments. The results of our study show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, where the spread of disease and infection rates decrease once social distancing procedures are implemented at higher levels. Also, the behavior space tool was used to run ten experiments with different levels of social distancing, which supported the previous results. We concluded that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels led to significantly reduced infection rates, which result in decreasing deaths. Both types of experiments prove that infection rates are reduced dramatically when the level of social distancing intervention is implemented between 80% to 100%.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Talal Daghriri","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Ozlem Ozmen","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Demosthenes Panagiotakos","author_inst":"School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Alberto Torres","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Vladimirov","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Frye","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Mohit Singhala","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk Jr.","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Holger Froehlich","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Peitsch","author_inst":"Philip Morris International"},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.19.20197822","rel_title":"Analysis of geo-temporal evolution and modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in Libya","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.19.20197822","rel_abs":"Having been experiencing years of political fragmentation and military conflict, Libya was poorly prepared to meet the challenges of the COVId-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, restriction of travel and social distancing rules were put in place days before the first case was detected. During the next two months, the number of cases grew gradually to 77 cases, followed by a rapid spread that has produced 3691 confirmed cases and 80 deaths by the end of July 2020. The turning point on 26 May 2020 was preceded three weeks earlier by the arrival of the first of a series of flights repatriating Libyans who became stranded abroad when air travel was suspended. In the first weeks of the surge, the number of cases was particularly high in the less densely populated southern region, raising questions about the implementation of social distancing and other protective measures in that region. The epidemic in Libya was modeled using the classical Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) mathematical model of infectious disease epidemics. Three scenarios were developed based on three estimates of the fraction of the population exposed to the disease (1.5, 2.5 and 3.5%). The modeling portrays the peak of the epidemic around early August and estimates that the number of deaths will flatten out around early November at between 250 and 600, depending on the parameter employed. More deaths than those estimated implies that is more widespread than assumed. Greater promotion of awareness and understanding of social distancing practices and their value is needed, particularly in the south, and better protection of the elderly should decrease mortality.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amin Bredan","author_inst":"Independent scholar, previously with Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, and VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Hani Benamer","author_inst":"Neurology Department, New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Omran Bakoush","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine & Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE, and Department of Nephrology, Lund Univers"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Alberto Torres","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Vladimirov","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Frye","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Mohit Singhala","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk Jr.","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Holger Froehlich","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Peitsch","author_inst":"Philip Morris International"},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.19.20198010","rel_title":"A comparison of five epidemiological models for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in India","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.19.20198010","rel_abs":"Many popular disease transmission models have helped nations respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by informing decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. We compare five epidemiological models for forecasting and assessing the course of the pandemic. We compare how the models analyze case-recovery-death count data in India, the country with second highest reported case-counts in a world where a large proportion of infections remain undetected. A baseline curve-fitting model is introduced, in addition to three compartmental models: an extended SIR (eSIR) model, an expanded SEIR model developed to account for infectiousness of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases (SAPHIRE), another SEIR model to handle high false negative rate and symptom-based administration of tests (SEIR-fansy). A semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model developed at the Imperial College London (ICM) is also examined. Using COVID-19 data for India from March 15 to June 18 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from June 19 to July 18. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) and mean squared relative prediction error (MSRPE) for each of the five models. For active case counts, SEIR-fansy yields an SMAPE value of 0.72, and the eSIR model yields a value of 33.83. For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 1.76 for baseline model, 23.10 for eSIR, 2.07 for SAPHIRE and 3.20 for SEIR-fansy. For cumulative death counts, the SEIR-fansy model performs the best, with an SMAPE of 7.13, as compared to 26.30 for the eSIR model. Using Pearson correlation coefficient and Lin concordance correlation coefficient, for cumulative case counts, the baseline model exhibits highest correlation (both Pearson as well as Lin coefficients), while for cumulative death counts, projections from SEIR-fansy exhibit the best performance: For cumulative cases, correlation coefficients computed for the baseline model are 1 (Pearson) and 0.991 (Lin). For eSIR, those values are 0.985 (Pearson) and 0.316 (Lin). For SAPHIRE, we compute 1 (Pearson) and 0.975 (Lin). Finally, for SEIR-fansy we have those values at 1 (Pearson) and 0.965 (Lin). Similarly, for cumulative deaths, correlation coefficients computed for eSIR is 0.978 (Pearson) and 0.206 (Lin), and for SEIR-fansy we have those values at 0.999 (Pearson) and 0.742 (Lin). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) counts as well. We compute underreporting factors on two specific dates (June 30 and July 10) and note that on both dates, the SEIR-fansy model reports the highest underreporting factor for active cases (June 30: 6.10 and July 10: 6.24) and cumulative deaths (June 30: 3.62 and July 10: 3.99) for both dates, while the SAPHIRE model reports the highest underreporting factor for cumulative cases (June 30: 27.79 and July 10: 26.74).","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soumik Purkayastha","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Rupam Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Ritwik Bhaduri","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute"},{"author_name":"Ritoban Kundu","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute"},{"author_name":"Xuelin Gu","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Salvatore","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk Jr.","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Holger Froehlich","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Peitsch","author_inst":"Philip Morris International"},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.19.20197970","rel_title":"Estimation and Interactive Visualization of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number Rt and the Time-Delay from Infection to Estimation","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.19.20197970","rel_abs":"Rt plays a key role in the development of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We sought to better understand the epidemiology of COVID-19 among hospitalized Hispanic patients by comparing individual and census-tract level characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those diagnosed with influenza, another viral infection with respiratory transmission. We evaluated the temporal changes in epidemiology across race-ethnicity related to a shelter-in-place mandate. METHODS: We evaluated patients hospitalized at Cook County Health, the safety-net health system for the Chicago metropolitan area. Among self-identified hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared those with influenza (2019-2020 influenza season) to COVID-19 infection during March 16, 2020 through May 11, 2020. We used multivariable analysis to identify differences in individual and census-tract level characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: Relative to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, COVID-19 rapidly increased among Hispanics during promotion of social-distancing policies. Whereas non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be hospitalized for influenza, Hispanic patients predominated among COVID-19 infections (40% relative increase compared to influenza). In the comparative analysis of influenza and COVID-19, Hispanic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to reside in census tracts with higher proportions of residents with the following characteristics: Hispanic; no high school diploma; non-US citizen; limited English speaking ability; employed in manufacturing or construction; and, overcrowding. By multivariable analysis, Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza were more likely to be male (adjusted OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9) or obese (aOR=2.5; 95% CI 1.5 to 4.2), and to reside in a census tract with [&ge;]40% of residents without a high-school diploma (aOR=2.5; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid and disproportionate increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations among Hispanics after the shelter-in-place mandate indicates that public health strategies were inadequate in protecting this population. In particular, those residing in neighborhoods with lower levels of educational attainment.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William E Trick","author_inst":"Cook County Health"},{"author_name":"Sheila Badri","author_inst":"Cook County Health"},{"author_name":"Kruti Doshi","author_inst":"Cook County Health"},{"author_name":"Huiyuan Zhang","author_inst":"Cook County Health"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Rezai","author_inst":"Cook County Health"},{"author_name":"Michael J Hoffman","author_inst":"Cook  County Health"},{"author_name":"Robert A Weinstein","author_inst":"Cook County Health and Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk Jr.","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Holger Froehlich","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Peitsch","author_inst":"Philip Morris International"},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.19.20198051","rel_title":"COVID-19: Risks of Re-emergence, Re-infection, and Control Measures -- A Long Term Modelling Study","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.19.20198051","rel_abs":"In this work we define a modified SEIR model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period, infections from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infected individuals, potential loss of acquired immunity, people's increasing awareness of social distancing and the use of vaccination as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions like social confinement. We estimate model parameters in three different scenarios - in Italy, where there is a growing number of cases and re-emergence of the epidemic, in India, where there are significant number of cases post confinement period and in Victoria, Australia where a re-emergence has been controlled with severe social confinement program. Our result shows the benefit of long-term confinement of 50% or above population and extensive testing. With respect to loss of acquired immunity, our model suggests higher impact for Italy. We also show that a reasonably effective vaccine with mass vaccination program can be successful in significantly controlling the size of infected population. We show that for India, a reduction in contact rate by 50% compared to a reduction of 10% in the current stage can reduce death from 0.0268% to 0.0141% of population. Similarly, for Italy we show that reducing contact rate by half can reduce a potential peak infection of 15% population to less than 1.5% of population, and potential deaths from 0.48% to 0.04%. With respect to vaccination, we show that even a 75% efficient vaccine administered to 50% population can reduce the peak number of infected populations by nearly 50% in Italy. Similarly, for India, a 0.056% of population would die without vaccination, while 93.75% efficient vaccine given to 30% population would bring this down to 0.036% of population, and 93.75% efficient vaccine given to 70% population would bring this down to 0.034%.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Subhas Kumar Ghosh","author_inst":"CBA"},{"author_name":"Sachchit Ghosh","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kruti Doshi","author_inst":"Cook County Health"},{"author_name":"Huiyuan Zhang","author_inst":"Cook County Health"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Rezai","author_inst":"Cook County Health"},{"author_name":"Michael J Hoffman","author_inst":"Cook  County Health"},{"author_name":"Robert A Weinstein","author_inst":"Cook County Health and Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk Jr.","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"},{"author_name":"Holger Froehlich","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Peitsch","author_inst":"Philip Morris International"},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.18.20197376","rel_title":"Age groups that sustain resurging COVID-19 epidemics in the United States","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.18.20197376","rel_abs":"Following initial declines, in mid 2020, a resurgence in transmission of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has occurred in the United States and parts of Europe. Despite the wide implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, it is still not known how they are impacted by changing contact patterns, age and other demographics. As COVID-19 disease control becomes more localised, understanding the age demographics driving transmission and how these impacts the loosening of interventions such as school reopening is crucial. Considering dynamics for the United States, we analyse aggregated, age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals and link these mechanistically to age-specific COVID-19 mortality data. In contrast to previous approaches, we link mobility to mortality via age-specific contact patterns and use this rich relationship to reconstruct accurate transmission dynamics. Contrary to anecdotal evidence, we find little support for age-shifts in contact and transmission dynamics over time. We estimate that, until August, 63.4% [60.9%-65.5%] of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States originated from adults aged 20-49, while 1.2% [0.8%-1.8%] originated from children aged 0- 9. In areas with continued, community-wide transmission, our transmission model predicts that re-opening kindergartens and elementary schools could facilitate spread and lead to additional COVID-19 attributable deaths over a 90-day period.

OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 is its Python interface, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Hinch","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William J M Probert","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anel Nurtay","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Michelle Kendall","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Wymatt","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hall","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Katrina Lythgoe","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ana Bulas Cruz","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lele Zhao","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Andrea Stewart","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luca Ferritti","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Daniel Montero","author_inst":"IBM United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"James Warren","author_inst":"IBM United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nicole Mather","author_inst":"IBM United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Matthew Abueg","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Neo Wu","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Anthony Finkelstein","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University College London"},{"author_name":"David G Bonsall","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lucie Abeler-Dorner","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Neil M Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Seth Flaxman","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Samir Bhatt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Ratmann","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"- Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Marc Jacobs","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)"},{"author_name":"Julia Hoeng","author_inst":"Philip Morris International (Switzerland)"},{"author_name":"Roland Eils","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin & Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)"},{"author_name":"Carsten Claussen","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing SCAI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.17.20192245","rel_title":"Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV2 viral loads in young children do not differ significantly from those in older children and adults","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.17.20192245","rel_abs":"The role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus has become a matter of urgent debate as societies in the US and abroad consider how to safely reopen schools.

Efficiently designing irreversible inhibitors, though, remains challenging. Here, we present covalentizer, a computational pipeline for creating irreversible inhibitors based on complex structures of targets with known reversible binders. For each ligand, we create a custom-made focused library of covalent analogs. We use covalent docking, to dock these tailored covalent libraries and to find those that can bind covalently to a nearby cysteine while keeping some of the main interactions of the original molecule. We found ~11,000 cysteines in close proximity to a ligand across 8,386 protein-ligand complexes in the PDB. Of these, the protocol identified 1,553 structures with covalent predictions. In prospective evaluation against a panel of kinases, five out of nine predicted covalent inhibitors showed IC50 between 155 nM - 4.2 M. Application of the protocol to an existing SARS-CoV-1 Mpro reversible inhibitor led to a new acrylamide inhibitor series with low micromolar IC50 against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The docking prediction was validated by 11 co-crystal structures. This is a promising lead series for COVID-19 antivirals. Together these examples hint at the vast number of covalent inhibitors accessible through our protocol.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Zaidman","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Paul Gehrtz","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Mihajlo Filep","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Daren Fearon","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jaime Prilusky","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Shirly Duberstein","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Galit Cohen","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"David Owen","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Efrat Resnick","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Claire Strain-Damerell","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Petra Lukacik","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"- Covid-Moonshot Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Haim Barr","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Martin A.

Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care is important to guide practice through this challenging time. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were invited to participate in an online survey. which was released between 13th May and 24th June 2020; a total of 3701 completed responses were received. Findings While anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women were more likely to indicate concern about their own and family's health and safety in relation to COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and women's partners were more likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided. Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less likely to agree. Conclusion This paper provides a unique exploration and comparison of experiences of receiving and providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Findings are useful to support further service changes and future service redesign. New evidence provided offers unique insight into key stakeholders' experiences of the rapid changes to health services.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zoe Bradfield","author_inst":"Curtin University; King Edward Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Karen Wynter","author_inst":"Deakin University; Centre for Quality and Patient Safety Research, Western Health Partnership"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Hauck","author_inst":"Curtin University"},{"author_name":"Vidanka Vasilevski","author_inst":"Deakin University; Centre for Quality and Patient Safety Research, Western Health Partnership"},{"author_name":"Lesley Kuliukas","author_inst":"Curtin University"},{"author_name":"Alyce Wilson","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Rebecca A Szabo","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Caroline Homer","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Linda Sweet","author_inst":"Deakin University; Centre for Quality and Patient Safety Research, Western Health Partnership"},{"author_name":"Claire Strain-Damerell","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Petra Lukacik","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"- Covid-Moonshot Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Haim Barr","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Martin A.

The first three cases were reported on March 18 (Day 1) and the last locally transmitted case occurred on April 26 (Day 40). An island confinement was imposed on March 20 followed by a sanitary curfew on March 23. Supermarkets were closed as from March 25 (Day 8). There were a total of 332 cases including 10 deaths from Day 1 to Day 41. Control of the outbreak depended heavily on contact tracing, testing, quarantine measures and the adoption of personal protective measures (PPMs) such as social distancing, the wearing of face masks and personal hygiene by Mauritius inhabitants. Our objectives were to model and understand the evolution of the Mauritius outbreak using mathematical analysis, a logistic growth model and an SEIR compartmental model with quarantine and a reverse sigmoid effective reproduction number and to relate the results to the public health control measures in Mauritius. Methods The daily reported cumulative number of cases in Mauritius were retrieved from the Worldometer website at https:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/coronavirus\/country\/mauritius\/. A susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-removed (SEIQR) model was introduced and analytically integrated under the assumption that the daily incidence of infectious cases evolved as the derivative of the logistic growth function. The cumulative incidence data was fitted using a logistic growth model. The SEIQR model was integrated computationally with an effective reproduction number (R_e) varying in time according to a three-parameter reverse sigmoid model. Results were compared with the retrieved data and the parameters were optimised using the normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) as a comparative statistic. Findings A closed-form analytical solution was obtained for the time-dependence of the cumulative number of cases. For a small final outbreak size, the solution tends to a logistic growth. The cumulative number of cases was well described by the logistic growth model (NRMSE = 0.0276, R^2=0.9945) and by the SEIQR model (NRMSE = 0.0270, R^2=0.9952) with the optimal parameter values. The value of R_e on the day of the reopening of supermarkets (Day 16) was found to be approximately 1.6. Interpretation A mathematical basis has been obtained for using the logistic growth model to describe the time evolution of outbreaks with a small final outbreak size. The evolution of the outbreak in Mauritius was consistent with one modulated by a time-varying effective reproduction number resulting from the epidemic control measures implemented by Mauritius authorities and the PPMs adopted by Mauritius inhabitants. The value of R_e{approx}1.6 on the reopening of supermarkets on Day 16 was sufficient for the outbreak to grow to large-scale proportions in case the Mauritius population did not comply with the PPMs. However, the number of cases remained contained to a small number which is indicative of a significant contribution of the PPMs in the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritius.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antoine Gehin","author_inst":"Lycee des Mascareignes"},{"author_name":"Smita Goorah","author_inst":"University of Mauritius"},{"author_name":"Khemanand Moheeput","author_inst":"Mauritius Institute of Education"},{"author_name":"Satish Ramchurn","author_inst":"University of Mauritius"},{"author_name":"Lesley Kuliukas","author_inst":"Curtin University"},{"author_name":"Alyce Wilson","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Rebecca A Szabo","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Caroline Homer","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Linda Sweet","author_inst":"Deakin University; Centre for Quality and Patient Safety Research, Western Health Partnership"},{"author_name":"Claire Strain-Damerell","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Petra Lukacik","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"- Covid-Moonshot Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Haim Barr","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Martin A.

As such, we determined the most cost-effective strategy for moderate to severe COVID-19 respiratory infections using the United States health care system as a representative model. Methods: A decision analytic model modelled a base case scenario of a 60-year-old patient admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Patients requiring oxygen were considered moderate severity, and patients with severe COVID-19 required intubation with intensive care. Strategies modelled included giving remdesivir to all patients, remdesivir in severe infections, remdesivir in moderate infections, dexamethasone to all patients, dexamethasone in severe infections, remdesivir in moderate\/dexamethasone in severe infections, and best supportive care. Data for the model came from the published literature. The time horizon was 1 year; no discounting was performed due to the short duration. The perspective was of the payer in the United States health care system. Results: Supportive care for moderate\/severe COVID-19 cost $11,112.98\/0.8256 QALY. Remdesivir in moderate\/dexamethasone in severe infections was the most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $19,764.56\/QALY gained compared to supportive care. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed remdesivir for moderate\/dexamethasone for severe COVID-19 infection was most cost-effective in 88.6% of scenarios and dexamethasone in moderate-severe infections in 11.4% of scenarios. With lower willingness to pay thresholds ($250-$37,500), dexamethasone for severe infections was favoured. Conclusions: Remdesivir for moderate\/dexamethasone for severe COVID-19 infections was the most cost-effective strategy. Further data is required for remdesivir to better assess its cost effectiveness in treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen E Congly","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Rhea A Varughese","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Crystal E Brown","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Fiona M Clement","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Lynora Saxinger","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Alyce Wilson","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Rebecca A Szabo","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Caroline Homer","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Linda Sweet","author_inst":"Deakin University; Centre for Quality and Patient Safety Research, Western Health Partnership"},{"author_name":"Claire Strain-Damerell","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Petra Lukacik","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"- Covid-Moonshot Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Haim Barr","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Martin A.

Since its emergence in December 2019, research has been focused on ways to not only treat the infected but also identify those at risk and prevent spread. There is currently no known biological biomarker that can predict the risk of being infected. A growing set of studies have emerged that show an association between ABO blood group and the risk of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we used retrospective observational data in Bahrain to investigate the association between ABO blood group and risk of infection as well as susceptibility to a more severe ICU-requiring infection. We found that individuals with blood group B were at a higher risk of infection, while those with blood group AB were at a lower risk. No association was observed between blood group and the risk of a severe ICU-requiring COVID-19 infection. We extended the analysis to study the association by antibodies present; anti-a (blood groups B and O) and anti-b (blood groups A and O). Antibodies were not found to be associated with either risk of infection or susceptibility to severe infection. The current study, along with the variation in blood group association results, indicates that blood group may not be the most ideal biomarker to predict risk of COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marwa AlMadhi","author_inst":"National Task Force for Combatting the Corona Virus (COVID19), Bahrain"},{"author_name":"Abdulkarim Abdulrahman","author_inst":"National Task Force for Combatting the Corona Virus (COVID19), Bahrain"},{"author_name":"Abdulla AlAwadhi","author_inst":"National Task Force for Combatting the Corona Virus (COVID19), Bahrain"},{"author_name":"Ali Rabaan","author_inst":"John Hopkins Aramco Health Care, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Manaf AlQahtani","author_inst":"National Task Force for Combatting the Corona Virus (COVID19)"},{"author_name":"Alyce Wilson","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Rebecca A Szabo","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Caroline Homer","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Linda Sweet","author_inst":"Deakin University; Centre for Quality and Patient Safety Research, Western Health Partnership"},{"author_name":"Claire Strain-Damerell","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Petra Lukacik","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"- Covid-Moonshot Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Haim Barr","author_inst":"The Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Martin A.
