Background. Several RT-qPCR kits are available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, some of them with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA, but most of them lacking of proper evaluation studies due to covid19 emergency. Objective. We evaluated Viasure RT-qPCR kit (CerTest Biotec, Spain) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using CDC FDA EUA kit as gold standard. Results. Although we found the lack of RNA quality control probe as the main limitation for Viasure kit, the sensitivity was up to 97.5% and specificity was 100%. Conclusions. Viasure RT-qPCR kit is a reliable tool for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis but improvement of an alternative RT-qPCR reaction for RNA extraction quality control as RNaseP is recommended.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Byron Freire-Paspuel","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Patricio Alejandro Vega-Marino","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena  para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Alberto Velez","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Marilyn Cruz","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Franklin Perez","author_inst":"One Lab.

These four have a relationship with the shape of the daily mortality curve once one considers the intervals from infection to death or recovery. Without an understanding of this relationship we cannot say that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives. Using a small stochastic model, the lockdown had to be weakened, in April and May, for simulated deaths to match ongoing actual daily deaths. Google mobility data was found to be consistent with the weakening required in the model with similar changes from baseline in time and magnitude. If in an earlier lockdown, mobility and interactions would have followed a similar course, then with a large epidemic curve an earlier lockdown might be associated with many more deaths than some currently believe. This was confirmed in the stochastic model and in two modified SIR models of epidemics of various sizes. The first SIR model had a fixed period to recovery and the second used random periods, both models had random periods to death. Weakening of the mitigations was required to tune the output in large but not in small epidemics. This gives weight to the epidemic having affected many more individuals than some reports currently suggest. In both one and two-week earlier lockdowns, total deaths were found to depend on the size of the epidemic and to vary from 2,000-49,000 deaths. There was a linear relationship between the peak proportion of the population infected and the reciprocal of the case fatality rate. This work questions the low prevalence of < 0.1%, reported by the Office for National Statistics in May and June 2020, since to accommodate a weakening lockdown, the shape of the daily mortality curve, and an acceptable case fatality rate a much larger epidemic curve is required.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony D Lander","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patricio Alejandro Vega-Marino","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena  para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Alberto Velez","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Marilyn Cruz","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Franklin Perez","author_inst":"One Lab.

The urgency for timely decisions resulted in a multitude of models as informed policy actions must be made even when so many uncertainties about the pandemic still remain. In this paper, we use machine learning algorithms to build intuitive country-level COVID-19 motion models described by death toll velocity and acceleration. Model explainability techniques provide insightful data-driven narratives about COVID-19 death toll motion models $-$ while velocity is explained by factors that are increasing\/reducing death toll pace now, acceleration anticipates the effects of public health measures on slowing the death toll pace. This allows policymakers and epidemiologists to understand factors driving the outbreak and to evaluate the impacts of different public health measures. Finally, our models also predict counterfactuals in order to face the challenge of estimating what is likely to happen as a result of an action.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adriano Veloso","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Nivio Ziviani","author_inst":"Kunumi, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Alberto Velez","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Marilyn Cruz","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Franklin Perez","author_inst":"One Lab.

In the past, the effect of temperature and humidity on the spread of the virus was studied for a very early phase of the data with mixed results. We are studying the impact of COVID-19 on the maximum temperature and relative humidity of a place using Indian states as test cases for SIR, SIRD, and SEIR models. We used a linear regression method to look for any dependency between effective reproduction number with maximum temperature and relative humidity. Most of the states show a correlation with the negative slope between the effective reproduction number with the maximum temperature and the relative humidity. It indicates that the effective reproduction number goes down as maximum temperature or relative humidity rise. But, the regression coefficient R2 is low for these correlations which means that the correlation is not strong.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manoj Mandal","author_inst":"Midnapore City College"},{"author_name":"Subhradeep Patra","author_inst":"Midnapore City College"},{"author_name":"Sabyasachi Pal","author_inst":"Midnapore City College"},{"author_name":"Suman Acharya","author_inst":"Midnapore City College"},{"author_name":"Mangal Hazra","author_inst":"Midnapore City College"},{"author_name":"Miguel Angel Garcia Bereguiain","author_inst":"Universidad de Las Americas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20143214","rel_title":"High frequency of cerebrospinal fluid autoantibodies in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms","rel_date":"2020-07-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20143214","rel_abs":"COVID-19 intensive care patients occasionally develop neurological symptoms. The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in most cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples suggests the involvement of further mechanisms including autoimmunity. We therefore determined whether anti-neuronal or anti-glial autoantibodies are present in eleven consecutive severely ill COVID-19 patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms. These included myoclonus, cranial nerve involvement, oculomotor disturbance, delirium, dystonia and epileptic seizures. Most patients showed signs of CSF inflammation and increased levels of neurofilament light chain. All patients had anti-neuronal autoantibodies in serum or CSF when assessing a large panel of autoantibodies against intracellular and surface antigens relevant for central nervous system diseases using cell-based assays and indirect immunofluorescence on murine brain sections. Antigens included proteins well-established in clinical routine, such as Yo or NMDA receptor, but also a variety of specific undetermined epitopes on brain sections. These included vessel endothelium, astrocytic proteins and neuropil of basal ganglia, hippocampus or olfactory bulb. The high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations suggests a causal relationship to clinical symptoms, in particular to hyperexcitability (myoclonus, seizures). While several underlying autoantigens still await identification in future studies, presence of autoantibodies may explain some aspects of multi-organ disease in COVID-19 and can guide immunotherapy in selected cases.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christiana Franke","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Caroline Ferse","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jakob Kreye","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Momsen Reincke","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Elisa Sanchez-Sendin","author_inst":"DZNE, Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rocco","author_inst":"Ernst-von-Bergmann Klinikum, Potsdam, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mirja Steinbrenner","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Stefan Angermair","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Sascha Treskatsch","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Daniel Zickler","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Kai-Uwe Eckardt","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rick Dersch","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Hosp","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinrich J.

Our focus is on trajectories of daily reported COVID-19 cases, rather than cumulative cases, as trajectories help us identify trends in how the pandemic naturally develops over time, and study the shapes of the curve in different states. Methods: We analyzed data on daily reported confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases from January 21 to June 16, 2020 in 50 states, adjusted for the population size of each state. Cluster analysis for time-series data was used to split the states into clusters that have distinct trajectories of daily cases. Differences in socio-demographic characteristics and healthcare access between clusters were tested. Adjusted models were used to determine if healthcare access is associated with reporting a high trajectory of COVID-19 cases. Results: Two clusters of states were identified. One cluster had a high trajectory of population-adjusted COVID-19 cases, and comprised of 19 states, including New York and New Jersey. The other cluster of states (n=31) had a low trajectory of population-adjusted COVID-19 cases. There were significantly more Black residents (p=0.027) and more nursing facility residents (p=0.001) in states reporting high trajectory of COVID-19 cases. States reporting a high trajectory of COVID-19 cases also had fewer uninsured persons (p=0.005), fewer persons who reported having to forgo medical care due to cost (p=0.016), more registered physicians (p=0.002) and more nurses (p=0.03), higher health spending per capita (p=0.01), fewer residents in Health Professional Shortage Areas per 100,000 population (p=0.027), and higher adoption of Medicaid Expansion (p=0.05). In adjusted models, a higher proportion of uninsured persons (OR: 0.51 [0.25-0.85]; p=0.032), higher proportion of patients who had to forgo medical care due to cost (OR: 0.55 [0.28-0.95]; p=0.048), and no adoption of Medicaid expansion (OR: 0.05 [0-0.59]; p=0.04), were associated with reporting a low trajectory of COVID-19 cases.

Progression of disease may cause tidal volumes to diverge from desired targets, and routine interventions (eg. suctioning) in one patient may adversely affect other patients. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrate a split-ventilator configuration that enables individualized patient management by incorporating a commonly available pressure regulator used for gas appliances. We validate this method by achieving various combinations of tidal volume in each of two synthetic lungs using a standard ventilator machine in combination with two gas flow analyzers. With further safety testing and instrumentation, pressure regulators may represent a viable path to substantially augment the capacity for ventilation in resource-constrained settings.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lakshminarayan Srinivasan","author_inst":"Transcend Review, Inc."},{"author_name":"Chris A Rishel","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Barrett J.

Only small areas in their 'Vitamin D winter' (monthly mean UVvitd of under 165 KJ\/m2) from Jan to April 2020. Participants The 'at-risk' population is the total small area population, with measures to incorporate spatial infection into the model. The model is adjusted for potential confounders including long-term winter temperature and humidity. Main outcome measures We derive UVA measures for each area from remote sensed data and estimate their relationship with COVID-19 mortality with a random effect for States, in a multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial model. In the USA and England death certificates had to record COVID-19. In Italy excess deaths in 2020 over expected from 2015-19. Data sources Satellite derived mean daily UVA dataset from Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Data on deaths compiled by Center for Disease Control (USA), Office for National Statistics (England) and Italian Institute of Statistics. Results Daily mean UVA (January-April 2020) varied between 450 to 1,000 KJ\/m2 across the three countries. Our fully adjusted model showed an inverse correlation between UVA and COVID-19 mortality with a Mortality Risk Ratio (MRR) of 0.71 (0.60 to 0.85) per 100KJ\/m2 increase UVA in the USA, 0.81 (0.71 to 0.93) in Italy and 0.49 (0.38 to 0.64) in England. Pooled MRR was 0.68 (0.52 to 0.88). Conclusions Our analysis, replicated in 3 independent national datasets, suggests ambient UVA exposure is associated with lower COVID-19 specific mortality. This effect is independent of vitamin D, as it occurred at irradiances below that likely to induce significant cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis. Causal interpretations must be made cautiously in observational studies.

The development of effective antiviral compounds and vaccines requires detailed descriptive studies of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates virion binding to the human cells through its interaction with the ACE2 cell surface receptor and is one of the prime immunization targets. A functional virion is composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits created by furin cleavage of the spike protein at R682, a polybasic cleavage sites that differs from the SARS-CoV spike protein of 2002. We observe that the spike protein is O-glycosylated on a threonine (T678) near the furin cleavage site occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures. In addition, we have identified eight additional O-glycopeptides on the spike glycoprotein and we confirmed that the spike protein is heavily N-glycosylated. Our recently developed LC-MS\/MS methodology allowed us to identify LacdiNAc structural motives on all occupied N-glycopeptides and polyLacNAc structures on six glycopeptides of the spike protein. In conclusion, our study substantially expands the current knowledge of the spike proteins glycosylation and enables the investigation of the influence of the O-glycosylation on its proteolytic activation.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miloslav Sanda","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Lindsay Morrison","author_inst":"Waters Corporation"},{"author_name":"Radoslav Goldman","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Feng","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Webb","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Chris Dibben","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Richard B Weller","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Atul Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Subir Kumar Maulik","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rick Dersch","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Hosp","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinrich J.

Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)(1-3). Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in both the lung and brain leading to lethality. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the lung, and no clinical signs of infection with a challenge dose of 104 plaque forming units. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing the ability of vaccines and antivirals to protect against disease, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raveen Rathnasinghe","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shirin Strohmeier","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Virginia L Gillespie","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael Schotsaert","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lynda Coughlan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sina"},{"author_name":"Melissa B Uccellini","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rick Dersch","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Hosp","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinrich J.

Numerous promising compounds included nucleotides, steroids, beta-lactams, and benzimidazoles. The main drawback to this approach was that a high percentage of compounds in some libraries were found to influence the observed Mac1 melting temperature. To prioritize DSF screening hits, the shapes of the observed melting curves and initial assay fluorescence were examined, and the results were compared with virtual screens performed using Autodock VINA.

Our analyses suggest the presence of unique sequence signatures in the 3\u2019-untranslated region (UTR) of betacoronavirus lineage B, which phylogenetically encompasses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, as well as multiple groups of bat and animal coronaviruses. In addition, we identified genome-wide patterns of variation across different SARS-CoV-2 strains that likely reflect the effects of selection. Finally, we provide evidence for a possible host microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3\u2019-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307-3p based on predicted, yet extensive, complementary base-pairings and similar interactions involving the Influenza A H1N1 virus. This interaction also suggests a possible survival mechanism, whereby a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 3\u2019-UTR leads to a weakened host immune response. The potential roles of host microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection, and the exploitation of conserved features in the 3\u2019-UTR as therapeutic targets warrant further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agnes P Chan","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix, AZ"},{"author_name":"Yongwook Choi","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix, AZ"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Schork","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix, AZ; Departments of Population Sciences and Molecular and Cell Biology, The City of Hope National "},{"author_name":"Nemanja Vuksanovic","author_inst":"The University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Trevor R Melkonian","author_inst":"The University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Nicholas R Silvaggi","author_inst":"The University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"David Frick","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Lynda Coughlan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sina"},{"author_name":"Melissa B Uccellini","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rick Dersch","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Hosp","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinrich J.

There is an urgent need to find therapeutic agents that can help clear the virus to prevent the severe disease and death. Identifying effective and safer drugs can provide with more options to treat the COVID-19 infections either alone or in combination. Here we performed a high throughput screen of approximately 1700 US FDA approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 24 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, and merfloquine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic\/effective concentration) of &gt;600, indicating wide therapeutic window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had safety index of 22 in similar experiments. Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion. These FDA approved compounds can provide much needed therapeutic options that we urgently need in the midst of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xia Xiao","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"Conghui Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"De Chang","author_inst":"Third Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100039, P.

Cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the disease because of the malignancy or treatment-related immunosuppression; hence identification of the vulnerable population among these patients is essential. It is speculated that along with ACE2, other auxiliary proteins (DPP4, ANPEP, ENPEP, TMPRSS2) might facilitate the entry of coronaviruses in the host cells. We took a bioinformatics approach to analyze the gene and protein expression data of these coronavirus receptors in human normal and cancer tissues of multiple organs. Here, we demonstrated an extensive RNA and protein expression profiling analysis of these receptors across solid tumors and normal tissues. We found that among all, renal tumor and normal tissues exhibited increased levels of ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and ENPEP. Our results revealed that TMPRSS2 may not be the co-receptor for coronavirus in renal carcinoma patients. The receptors\u2019 expression levels were variable in different tumor stage, molecular and immune subtypes of renal carcinoma. In clear cell renal cell carcinomas, coronavirus receptors were associated with high immune infiltration, markers of immunosuppression, and T cell exhaustion. Our study indicates that CoV receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma. As our current knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms will improve, it may help us in designing focused therapeutic approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Satyendra C Tripathi","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Nagpur"},{"author_name":"Vishwajit Deshmukh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Nagpur"},{"author_name":"Chad J.

In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, amplification efficiency, and linear detection ranges of three qRT-PCR assays, including the assays developed by our group (IPBCAMS), and the assays recommended by WHO and China CDC (CCDC). The three qRT-PCR assays exhibited similar sensitivities, with the limit of detection (LOD) at about 10 copies per reaction (except the ORF 1b gene assay in CCDC assays with a LOD at about 100 copies per reaction). No cross reaction with other respiratory viruses were observed in all of the three qRT-PCR assays. Wide linear detection ranges from 106 to 101 copies per reaction and acceptable reproducibility were obtained. By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92% and 100%, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60%), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64%) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48% and 20%, respectively).

We aimed to identify and characterize genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and to further explore their biological functions and potential as druggable targets.METHODS Using the gene expression profiles of 1,038 lung tissue samples, we performed a weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We explored the biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified known drug-gene interactions.RESULTS ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 12 genes with moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r&gt;0.3, FDR&lt;0.05) had known interactions with existing drug compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 co-expressed genes; 15 of these genes were enriched in the gene ontology biologic process \u2018Entry into host cell\u2019, and 53 TMPRSS2-correlated genes had known interactions with drug compounds.CONCLUSION Dozens of genes are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of the co-expressed genes are potentially targetable with existing drugs, which may help to fast-track the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementS.M. reports personal fees from Novartis and Boehringer-Ingelheim, outside the submitted work.

In particular, two signatures are likely ruled by APOBEC and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which induce hypermutation in a significant number of samples, and appear to be affected by severe purifying selection.Conversely, several mutations linked to low-rate mutational processes appear to transit to clonality in the population, eventually leading to the definition of new viral genotypes and to an increase of overall genomic diversity. Finally, we demonstrate that a high number of variants are observed in samples associated to independent lineages, likely due to signature-related mutational hotspots or to positive selection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex Graudenzi","author_inst":"Inst. of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IBFM-CNR), Segrate, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Maspero","author_inst":"Dept. of Informatics, Systems and Communication, Univ. of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Angaroni","author_inst":"Dept. of Informatics, Systems and Communication, Univ. of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rocco Piazza","author_inst":"Dept. of Medicine and Surgery, Univ. of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Ramazzotti","author_inst":"Dept. of Medicine and Surgery, Univ. of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Canada"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Pulmonary Diseases, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"David Nickle","author_inst":"Merck Research Laboratories, Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Boston, Massachusetts"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New "},{"author_name":"Don D Sin","author_inst":"Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Smith","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Kugelman","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Brett F Beitzel","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M Gibson","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sara C Johnston","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Minogue","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.06.190348","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 contributes to altering the post-transcriptional regulatory networks across human tissues by sponging RNA binding proteins and micro-RNAs","rel_date":"2020-07-06","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.06.190348","rel_abs":"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide public health emergency. Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 mediated alteration on post-transcriptional gene regulation across human tissues remains elusive. In this study, we analyze publicly available genomic datasets to systematically dissect the crosstalk and dysregulation of human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins directly interact with 51 human RBPs of which majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed a functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock-treated versus SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells that revealed enrichment for immune response, cytokine-mediated signaling, and metabolism associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to control demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to viral infection. Motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed the enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs, and HNRNPs suggesting the sponging of RBPs by SARS-CoV-2 genome. A similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed functionally important miRs that were highly expressed in immune cells, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to the progression of the viral infection and modulate host immune response across other human tissues. Given the need to understand the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with key post-transcriptional regulators in the human genome, this study provides a systematic computational analysis to dissect the role of dysregulated post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by RBPs and miRs, across tissues types during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajneesh Srivastava","author_inst":"Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)"},{"author_name":"Swapna Vidhur Daulatabad","author_inst":"Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)"},{"author_name":"Mansi Srivastava","author_inst":"Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)"},{"author_name":"Sarath Chandra Janga","author_inst":"Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)"},{"author_name":"Daniele Ramazzotti","author_inst":"Dept. of Medicine and Surgery, Univ. of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Canada"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Pulmonary Diseases, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"David Nickle","author_inst":"Merck Research Laboratories, Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Boston, Massachusetts"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New "},{"author_name":"Don D Sin","author_inst":"Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Smith","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Kugelman","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Brett F Beitzel","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M Gibson","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sara C Johnston","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Minogue","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20144543","rel_title":"The Sensitivity of Respiratory Tract Specimens for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2: A Protocol for a Living Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-07-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20144543","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Highly sensitive, non-invasive, and easily accessible diagnostics for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are essential for the control of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Values greater than one correspond to increasing rates of infection, and values less than one indicate that control measures are being effective. Here, we summarise how changes in the behaviour of individuals alter the value of R. We also use matrix models that correctly recreate distributions of times that individuals spend incubating the disease and being infective to demonstrate the accuracy of a simple approximation to estimate R directly from time series of case numbers, hospital admissions or deaths. The largest uncertainty is that the generation time of the infection is not precisely known, but this challenge also affects most of the more complex methods of calculating R. We use this approximation to examine changes in R in response to the introduction of lockdown restrictions in England. This suggests that there was a substantial reduction in R before large scale compulsory restrictions on economic and social activity were imposed on 23rd March 2020. From mid-April to mid-June decline of the epidemic at national and regional level has been relatively slow, despite these restrictions (R values clustered around 0.81). However, these estimates of R are consistent with the relatively high average numbers of close contacts reported by confirmed cases combined with directly measured attack rates via close interactions. This implies that a significant portion of transmission is occurring in workplaces; overcrowded housing or through close contacts that are not currently lawful, routes on which nationwide lockdown will have limited impact.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alastair Grant","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Hyubjin Lee","author_inst":"Korea University"},{"author_name":"Yon Dohn Chung","author_inst":"Korea University"},{"author_name":"Kate Nyhan","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA | Harvey Cushing \/ John Hay Whitney Medical Libra"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Bromberg","author_inst":"Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA | Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Shi","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne L Wyllie","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Don D Sin","author_inst":"Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Smith","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Kugelman","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Brett F Beitzel","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M Gibson","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sara C Johnston","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Minogue","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144592","rel_title":"Genetic risk factors for death with SARS-CoV-2 from the UK Biobank","rel_date":"2020-07-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144592","rel_abs":"We present here genetic risk factors for survivability from infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).

The point estimates we reach based on data from late June 2020 are 1 in 4,300 for full flights and 1 in 7,700 when middle seats are kept empty. These estimates are subject to both quantifiable and nonquantifiable sources of uncertainty, and sustain known margins of error of a factor about 2.5. However, because uncertainties in key parameters affect both risk estimates the same way, they leave the relative risk ratio for fill all seats compared to middle seat open close to 1.8 (i.e., close to 1\/4,300)\/(1\/7,700). We estimate the mortality risks caused by Covid-19 infections contracted on airplanes, taking into account that infected passengers can in turn infect others. The point estimates, which use 2019 data about the percentage of seats actually occupied on US flights, range from one death per 400,000 passengers to one death per 600,000. These death-risk levels are considerably higher than those associated with plane crashes but comparable to those arising from two hours of everyday activities during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arnold Barnett","author_inst":"MIT Sloan School of Management"},{"author_name":"Giada Maria Di Pietro","author_inst":"Uiniversity of Milan"},{"author_name":"Ester Luconi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Julian Gough","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Bromberg","author_inst":"Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA | Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Shi","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne L Wyllie","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Don D Sin","author_inst":"Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Smith","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Kugelman","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Brett F Beitzel","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M Gibson","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sara C Johnston","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Minogue","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20136721","rel_title":"An Automatic Computer-Based Method for Fast and Accurate Covid-19 Diagnosis","rel_date":"2020-07-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20136721","rel_abs":"At present, the whole world is witnessing a horrifying outbreak caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus responsible for this disease is called SARS-CoV-2. It affects its victims respiratory system and causes severe lung inflammation, making it harder for them to breathe. The virus is airborne, and so has a high infection rate. Originated in China last December, the virus has spread across seven continents, affecting the population of over 210 countries, making it one of the fiercest pandemics ever recorded. Despite multiple independent and collaborative attempts to develop a vaccine or a cure, an effective solution is yet to come out. While the disease has put the world in a standstill, detecting the positive subjects and isolating them from the others as soon as possible is the only way to minimize its spread. However, many countries are currently experiencing a massive shortage of diagnostic equipment and medical personals. This insufficiency inspired us to work on a computer-based automatic method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, we proposed a sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to detect COVID-19 through analyzing Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. The model is capable of identifying the disease with almost 92.5% accuracy. We believe the implementation of this model will help the physicians and pathologists all over the world to single out the victims quickly and thus reduce the prevalence of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdullah Al Jaid Jim","author_inst":"Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Rafi","author_inst":"Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

If SARS-CoV-2 also spreads via aerosols, this has implications for measures taken to limit transmission. Objectives The aim of this study is to assess exposure to airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles from breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing in an indoor environment. Methods An exposure assessment model was developed to estimate numbers of SARS-CoV-2 particles in aerosol droplets, expelled during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing by an infected person in an unventilated indoor environment, and subsequent inhalation by one or more persons. Scenarios encompass a range of virus concentrations, room sizes and exposure times. Results The calculated total volume of expelled aerosol droplets was highest for a sneeze, followed by a cough and speaking for 20 minutes, and lastly breathing for 20 minutes. A few to as much as tens of millions of virus particles were expelled. Exposure probability strongly depends on the viral concentration in mucus, as well as on the scenario. Exposure probabilities were generally below 1% at a virus concentration in mucus below 10^5 per mL for all scenarios, increasing steeply at different higher concentrations. According to nose \/ throat swab data collected from patients, 75%, 50% and 5% of infected individuals carry an estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 per mL mucus of at least 10^5, 10^6 and 10^8, respectively. Discussion Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols generated during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing in an unventilated indoor environment is possible. This study forms a basis to estimate probabilities of exposure to SARS-Cov-2 by airborne transmission in indoor spaces. As long as it is uncertain what fraction of the airborne virus particles is infectious and as long as a dose response relation is lacking, it is recommended to be precautious.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack F.
