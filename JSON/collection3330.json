Using an epidemiological model fit to COVID-19 hospitalization counts from New York City, New York and Austin, Texas, we found that the undocumented attack rate in the first pandemic wave depends on the proportion of asymptomatic infections but not on the infectiousness of such individuals. Based on a recent report that 22.7% of New Yorkers are seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, we estimate that 56% (95% CI: 53-59%) of COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic. Given uncertainty in the case hospitalization rate, however, the asymptomatic proportion could be as low as 20% or as high as 80%. We find that at most 1.26% of the Austin population was infected by April 27, 2020 and conclude that immunity from undetected infections is unlikely to slow future pandemic spread in most US cities in the summer of 2020.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Spencer J Fox","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Remy Pasco","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Tec","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Du","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Michael Lachmann","author_inst":"Santa Fe Institute"},{"author_name":"James Scott","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Lauren Ancel Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin, Santa Fe Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137299","rel_title":"Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency and mortality from respiratory diseases in a cohort of older adults: potential for limiting the death toll during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137299","rel_abs":"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic goes along with increased mortality from acute respiratory disease, and measures to limit the spread of the infection go along with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, especially among high risk groups. It has been suggested that vitamin D3 supplementation might help to reduce respiratory disease mortality. Methods. We assessed the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency, defined by 25(OH)D blood levels of 30-50 and <30 nmol\/L, respectively, and their association with mortality from respiratory diseases during 15 years of follow-up in a cohort of 9,548 adults aged 50-75 years from Saarland, Germany. Results. Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency were common (44% and 15%, respectively). Compared to sufficient vitamin D status, respiratory disease mortality was 2.1 (95%-CI 1.3-3.2)- and 3.0 (95%-CI 1.8-5.2)-fold increased, respectively. Although significant increases were seen in both women and men, they were much stronger among women, with 8.5 (95% CI 2.4-30.1) and 2.3 (95% CI 1.1-4.4)-fold increase of respiratory disease mortality in case of vitamin D deficiency among women and men, respectively (p-value for interaction =0.041). Overall, 41% (95% CI 20%-58%) of respiratory disease mortality was statistically attributable to vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Conclusion. Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are common and account for a large proportion of respiratory disease mortality in older adults, supporting suggestions that vitamin D3 supplementation might make a major contribution to limit the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among women.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hermann Brenner","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Bernd Holleczek","author_inst":"Saarland Cancer Registry"},{"author_name":"Ben Schoettker","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Du","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Michael Lachmann","author_inst":"Santa Fe Institute"},{"author_name":"James Scott","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Lauren Ancel Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin, Santa Fe Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137208","rel_title":"Understanding the Bias between the Number of Confirmed Cases and Actual Number of Infections in the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137208","rel_abs":"The number of positive cases confirmed in the viral tests is a probe of the actual number of infections of COVID-19. The bias between these two quantities is a key element underlying the determination of some important parameters of this disease and the policy-making during the pandemic.

After comparing with the historical data of the USA in the past few months, we find a simple formula relating these four variables. As a few applications, we show, among other things, how this formula can be used to project the number of actual infections, to provide guidance on how the test volume should be adjusted, and to derive an upper bound on the overall infection fatality rate of COVID-19 ([&le;]0.64%, 95% C.L.) and a theoretical estimate of its value.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xingang Chen","author_inst":"Institute for Theory and Computation, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics"},{"author_name":"Dhiraj Kumar Hazra","author_inst":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Ben Schoettker","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Du","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Michael Lachmann","author_inst":"Santa Fe Institute"},{"author_name":"James Scott","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Lauren Ancel Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin, Santa Fe Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137992","rel_title":"Hydroxychloroquine serum concentrations in non-critical care patients infected with SARS CoV 2","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137992","rel_abs":"Hydroxychloroquine(HCQ) has been widely used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection however HCQ pharmacokinetics in this condition have not been studied in non-critical care patient groups.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mental health status was assessed using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21), and insomnia was evaluated by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Samples were categorized into the frontline and non-frontline groups. Chi-square, odds ratio, and independent t-tests were used to compare groups by demographic and mental health outcomes. Results This study included 1139 HCWs working in Oman. There was a total of 368 (32.3%), 388 (34.1%), 271 (23.8%), and 211 (18.5%) respondents reported to have depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia, respectively while working during the pandemic period. HCWs in the frontline group were 1.4 times more likely to have anxiety (OR=1.401, p=0.007) and stress (OR=1.404, p=0.015) as compared to those working in the non-frontline group. On indices of sleep-wake cycles, HCWs in the frontline group were 1.37 times more likely to report insomnia (OR=1.377, p=0.037) when compared to those working in the non-frontline group. No significant differences in depression status between workers in the frontline and non-frontline groups were found (p=0.181). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different grades of HCWs. This study suggests that frontline HCWs are disproportionally affected compared to non-frontline HCWs. The problem with managing sleep-wake cycles and anxiety symptoms were highly endorsed among frontline HCWs. As psychosocial interventions are likely to be constrained owing to the pandemic, mental health care must first be directed to frontline HCWs.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muna Alshekaili","author_inst":"Al Masarra Hospital, Ministry of Health, Oman"},{"author_name":"Walid Hassan","author_inst":"Al Masarra Hospital, Ministry of Health, Oman"},{"author_name":"Nazik Al Said","author_inst":"Al Masarra Hospital, Ministry of Health, Oman"},{"author_name":"Fatima Alsulaimani","author_inst":"Al Masarra Hospital, Ministry of Health, Oman"},{"author_name":"Sathish Kumar Jayapal","author_inst":"Centre of Studies & Research, Directorate General Planning, and studies, Ministry of Health, Oman"},{"author_name":"Adhra Al-Mawali","author_inst":"Centre of Studies & Research, Directorate General Planning, and studies, Ministry of Health, Oman"},{"author_name":"Moon Fai Chan","author_inst":"Department of Family Medicine & Public Health, College of Medicine & Health Sciences Sultan Qaboos University"},{"author_name":"Sangeetha Mahadevan","author_inst":"Department of Behavioral Medicine, College of Medicine & Health Sciences, Sultan Qaboos University"},{"author_name":"Samir Al-Adawi","author_inst":"Sultan Qaboos University"},{"author_name":"Nick maskell","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137406","rel_title":"Current infection control behaviour patterns in the UK, and how they can be improved by 'Germ Defence', an online behavioural intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the home.","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137406","rel_abs":"Background: Germ Defence (https:\/\/germdefence.org\/) is a freely available website providing behavioural advice for infection control within households, using behaviour change techniques. This observational study reports current infection control behaviours in the home in UK and international users of the website, and examine how they might be improved to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Method: 28,285 users sought advice from four website pathways (to protect themselves generally, to protect others if the user was showing symptoms, to protect themselves if household members were showing symptoms, and to protect a household member who is at high risk) and completed outcome measures of current infection control behaviours within the home (self-isolation, social distancing, putting shopping\/packages aside, wearing face-covering, cleaning and disinfecting, handwashing), and intentions to change these behaviours. Results: Current user behaviours mean scores varied across all infection control measures but were between 'sometimes' and 'quite often', except handwashing ('very often'). Behaviours were similar regardless of the website pathway used. After using Germ Defence, users recorded intentions to improve infection control behaviour across all website pathways and for all behaviours. Conclusions: Self-reported infection control behaviours other than handwashing are lower than is optimal for infection prevention, although reported handwashing is much higher. The advice using behaviour change techniques in Germ Defence led to intentions to improve these behaviours. This has been shown previously to reduce the incidence, severity and transmission of infections. These findings suggest that promoting Germ Defence within national and local public health guidance could reduce COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ben Ainsworth","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Sascha Miller","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Denison-Day","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Julia Groot","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Cathy Rice","author_inst":"Public contributor"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Bostock","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yang Hu","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Kate Morton","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Lauren Towler","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Michael Moore","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Merlin L Willcox","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Tim Chadborn","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Natalie Gold","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Richard Amlot","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Paul Little","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20138149","rel_title":"Clinical characteristics of Covid-19 patients with re-positive test results: an observational study","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20138149","rel_abs":"Background: With coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) ravaging the global, concern has been aroused whether discharged Covid-19 patients with reappeared positive nucleic acid test results are infected again. Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of discharged Covid-19 patients with reappeared positive nucleic acid test results and to track clinical outcomes of them. Methods: We extracted clinical data on 938 Covid-19 patients from Wuhan Union Hospital (West Branch), and we obtained information about residual symptoms and nucleic acid tests after discharge through follow-up study. We evaluated the relationship of clinical characteristics and reappeared positive results. Each patient had at least 44 days of follow-up. Results: Of 938 discharged patients, a total of 58 (6.2%) had reappeared positive nucleic acid test results and 880 remain negative. Among patients over the age of 50, the factors we found to be associated with re-positive results were coronary artery disease (14.1%, vs. 5.5% among those without coronary artery disease; odds ratio, 2.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28 to 6.15), and hypertension (9.5%, vs. 4.9% among those without hypertension; odds ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.10 to 3.82). As of May 11, 2020, 54 (93.1%) re-positive patients turned negative again while two patients remained positive, and two patients was lost to the second follow-up.

The Chinese government executed a series of interventions to curb the pandemic. The \"battle\" against COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China is valuable because populated industrial cities are the epic centres of COVID-19 in many regions. We made use of synthetic control methods to create a reference population matching specific characteristics of Shenzhen. With both the synthetic and observed data, we introduced an epidemic compartmental model to compare the spread of COVID-19 between Shenzhen and its counterpart regions in the United States that didn't implement interventions for policy evaluation. Once the effects of policy interventions adopted in Shenzhen were estimated, the delay effects of those interventions were referred to provide the further control degree of interventions. Thus, the hypothetical epidemic situations in Shenzhen were inferred by using time-varying reproduction numbers in the proposed SIHR (Susceptible, Infectious, Hospitalized, Removed) model and considering if the interventions were delayed by 0 day to 5 days. The expected cumulative confirmed cases would be 1546, which is 5.75 times of the observed cumulative confirmed cases of 269 in Shenzhen on February 3, 2020, based on the data from the counterpart counties (mainly from Broward, New York, Santa Clara, Pinellas, and Westchester) in the United States. If the interventions were delayed by 5 days from the day when the interventions started, the expected cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen on February 3, 2020 would be 676 with 95% credible interval (303,1959). Early implementation of mild interventions can subdue the epidemic of COVID-19. The later the interventions were implemented, the more severe the epidemic was in the hard-hit areas. Mild interventions are less damaging to the society but can be effective when implemented early.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Tian","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wenxiang Luo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianbin Tan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Yukang Jiang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Minqiong Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wenliang Pan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Songpan Yang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jiashu Zhao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Wang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Fanjun Cheng","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Youming Lu","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"},{"author_name":"Ling-Qiang Zhu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20134882","rel_title":"3d Virtual Patho-Histology of Lung Tissue from Covid-19 Patients based on Phase Contrast X-ray Tomography","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20134882","rel_abs":"We present a new approach of three-dimensional (3d) virtual histology and patho-histology based on multi-scale phase contrast x-ray tomography, and use this to investigate the parenchymal-architecture of unstained lung tissue from patients who succumbed to Covid-19.

A search of electronic information was conducted to identify studies comparing the diagnostic performance within the same patient cohort of chest CT scan versus RT-PCR in COVID-19 suspected cases. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included other test performance characteristics, discrepant findings between both investigations and main chest CT findings. Random effects modelling was used for the analyses. Results Thirteen non-randomised studies enrolling 4092 patients were identified. Accuracy was statistically significantly higher for RT-PCR versus chest CT (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.22, P = 0.001). Chest CT is also less specific than RT-PCR. Ground-glass opacities and consolidations were the most common chest CT manifestations. Importantly, early small studies tended to favour chest CT versus later larger studies. Conclusion Chest CT is inferior to RT-PCR for the initial detection of COVID-19 and has more false positives. It may still be useful in confirming COVID-19, however, in patients with a suspicious clinical presentation, but who have a false-negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Karam","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Sulaiman Althuwaikh","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Alazemi","author_inst":"School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Abul","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Amrit Hayre","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Abdulmalik Alsaif","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Barlow Gavin","author_inst":"Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Christopher Werlein","author_inst":"Medizinische Hochschule Hannover"},{"author_name":"Mark Kuehnel","author_inst":"Medizinische Hochschule Hannover"},{"author_name":"Danny Jonigk","author_inst":"Medizinische Hochschule Hannover"},{"author_name":"Tim Salditt","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Youming Lu","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"},{"author_name":"Ling-Qiang Zhu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137695","rel_title":"Serologic cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with endemic and seasonal Betacoronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137695","rel_abs":"In order to properly understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of humoral immunity, researchers have evaluated the presence of serum antibodies of people worldwide experiencing the pandemic.

Further analysis of cross-reactivity could provide informative data that could lead to intelligently designed pan-coronavirus therapeutics or vaccines.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer Hicks","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Carleen Klumpp-Thomas","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Heather Kalish","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Anandakumar Shunmugavel","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Mehalko","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"John-Paul Denson","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kelly Snead","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Matthew Drew","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kizzmekia Corbett","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Barney Graham","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Youming Lu","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"},{"author_name":"Ling-Qiang Zhu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137729","rel_title":"Association Between Nursing Home Crowding and COVID-19 Infection and Mortality in Ontario, Canada","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137729","rel_abs":"Importance: Nursing home residents have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic. Prevention recommendations have emphasized frequent testing of healthcare personnel and residents, but additional strategies are needed to protect nursing home residents. Objective: We developed a reproducible index of nursing home crowding and determined whether crowding was associated with incidence of COVID-19 in the first months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based retrospective cohort study of over 78,000 residents of 618 distinct nursing homes in Ontario, Canada from March 29 to May 20, 2020. Exposure: The nursing home crowding index equalled the average number of residents per bedroom and bathroom. Outcomes: Primary outcomes included the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infection and mortality, per 100 residents; introduction of COVID-19 into a home (>=1 resident case) was a negative tracer. Results: Of 623 homes in Ontario, we obtained complete information on 618 homes (99%) housing 78,607 residents. A total of 5,218 residents (6.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, and 1,452 (1.8%) died with COVID-19 infection as of May 20, 2020. COVID-19 infection was distributed unevenly across nursing homes: 4,496 (86%) of infections occurred in just 63 (10%) of homes. The crowding index ranged across homes from 1.3 (mainly single-occupancy rooms) to 4.0 (exclusively quadruple occupancy rooms); 308 (50%) homes had high crowding index (>=2). Incidence in high crowding index homes was 9.7%, versus 4.5% in low crowding index homes (p<0.001), while COVID-19 mortality was 2.7%, versus 1.3%. The likelihood of COVID-19 introduction did not differ (31.3% vs 30.2%, p=0.79). After adjustment for regional, nursing home, and resident covariates, the crowding index remained associated with increased risk of infection (RR=1.72, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.11-2.65) and mortality (RR=1.72, 95%CI: 1.03-2.86). Propensity score analysis yielded similar conclusions for infection (RR=2.06, 95%CI: 1.34-3.17) and mortality (RR=2.09, 95%CI: 1.30-3.38). Simulations suggested that converting all 4-bed rooms to 2-bed rooms would have averted 988 (18.9%) infections of COVID-19 and 271 (18.7%) deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: Crowding was associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Reducing crowding in nursing homes could prevent future COVID-19 mortality.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin A Brown","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jones","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Nick Daneman","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adrienne K Chan","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kevin L Schwartz","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Gary E Garber","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Andrew Costa","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Nathan M Stall","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Kizzmekia Corbett","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Barney Graham","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Youming Lu","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"},{"author_name":"Ling-Qiang Zhu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137745","rel_title":"Face mask wearing rate predicts country's COVID-19 death rates","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137745","rel_abs":"Identification of biomedical and socioeconomic predictors for the number of deaths by COVID-19 among countries will lead to the development of effective intervention. While previous multiple regression studies have identified several predictors for the number of COVID-19-related deaths, little is known for the association with mask non-wearing rate possibly because the data is available for limited number of countries, which constricts the application of traditional multiple regression approach to screen a large number of potential predictors. In this study, we used the hypothesis-driven regression approach to test the association with limited number of predictors based on the hypothesis that the mask non-wearing rate can predict the number of deaths to a large extent together with age and BMI, other relatively independent risk factors for hospitalized patients of COVID-19. The mask non-wearing rate, percentage of age [&ge;] 80 (male), and male BMI showed Spearman's correlations up to about 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6, respectively, with the numbers of deaths per million in 22 countries from mid-March to mid-June, 2020. The observed numbers of deaths per million were significantly correlated with those predicted by the lasso regression model including four predictors, age [&ge;] 80 (male), male BMI, and mask non-wearing rates from mid-March and late April to early May (Pearson's coefficient = 0.919). The multiple linear regression models including the mask non-wearing rates, age, and obesity-related predictors explained up to 75% variation of the number of deaths per million in the 22 countries with little concerns about multicollinearity. Furthermore, linear regressions using the mask non-wearing rate in mid-March as the sole predictor still explained up to 72% of the variation of the numbers of deaths from March to mid-June, emphasizing the importance of the strongest predictor. Although further verification is needed to identify causes of the national differences in COVID-19 mortality rates, these findings highlight the importance of the mask, age, and BMI in predicting the COVID-19-related deaths, providing a useful strategy for future regression analyses that attempt to contribute to the mechanistic understanding of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daisuke Miyazawa","author_inst":"Miyazawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gen Kaneko","author_inst":"School of Arts & Sciences, University of Houston-Victoria"},{"author_name":"Nick Daneman","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adrienne K Chan","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kevin L Schwartz","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Gary E Garber","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Andrew Costa","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Nathan M Stall","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Kizzmekia Corbett","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Barney Graham","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Youming Lu","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"},{"author_name":"Ling-Qiang Zhu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137620","rel_title":"Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among health care workers in a country with low burden of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137620","rel_abs":"Greece is a country with limited spread of SARS-CoV-2 and cumulative infection attack rate of 0.12% (95%CI 0.06%-0.26%).

We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among health care workers at a large acute care hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. We determined correlations between seroprevalence, self-reported symptoms and occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Methods and findings: All employees at Danderyd Hospital (n=4375) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study. 2149 employees from all hospital departments were enrolled in the study between April 14th and May 8th 2020. Study participants completed a questionnaire consisting of symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection since January 2020 and occupational exposure to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed using a multiplex assay evaluated to have 99.4% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. The over-all seroprevalence among 2149 participants was 19.1% (n=410). There was no difference in age or sex between seropositive and seronegative participants. The symptoms with the strongest correlation to seroprevalence were anosmia and ageusia, with odds ratios of 28.4 (p=2.02*10^-120) and 19.2 (p=1.67*10^-99) respectively. Seroprevalence was strongly associated with patient-related work (OR 2.9, p=4.24*10^-8), covid-19 patient contact (OR 1.43, p=0.003), and occupation as assisting nurse (OR 3.67, p=2.16*10^-9). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that anosmia and ageusia should be included in screening guidance and in the recommendations of self-isolation to reduce further spread of SARS-CoV-2. The results furthermore imply an occupational health risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital workers. Continued measures are warranted to assure healthcare worker safety and reduce transmission from health care settings to the community during the covid-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ann-Sofie Rudberg","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Havervall","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Anna Manberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"August Jernbom Falk","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Katherina Aguilera","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henry Ng","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Lena Gabrielsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ann-Christin Salomonsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Leo Hanke","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murell","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Jennie Olofsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Eni Andersson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Hellstrom","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Shaghayegh Bayati","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sofia Bergstrom","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pin","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ronald Sjoberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanna Tegel","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137588","rel_title":"The impact of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions on the future dynamics of endemic infections","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137588","rel_abs":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been employed to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, yet these measures are already having similar effects on other directly-transmitted, endemic diseases. Disruptions to the seasonal transmission patterns of these diseases may have consequences for the timing and severity of future outbreaks. Here we consider the implications of SARS-CoV-2 NPIs for two endemic infections circulating in the United States of America (USA): respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and seasonal influenza. Using laboratory surveillance data from 2020, we estimate that RSV transmission declined by at least 20% in the USA at the start of the NPI period. We simulate future trajectories of both RSV and influenza, using an epidemic model. As susceptibility increases over the NPI period, we find that substantial outbreaks of RSV may occur in future years, with peak outbreaks likely occurring in the winter of 2021-2022. Results for influenza broadly echo this picture, but are more uncertain; future outbreaks are likely dependent on the transmissibility and evolutionary dynamics of circulating strains.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel E.

The latter allows to take into account the variation of infectiousness as a function of time since infection. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a vaccine or treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.} social distancing) are of great importance to mitigate the pandemic. We propose a model with a double continuous structure by host age and time since infection. By applying optimal control theory to our age-structured model, we identify a solution minimizing deaths and costs associated with the implementation of the control strategy itself. This strategy depends on the age heterogeneity between individuals and consists in a relatively high isolation intensity over the older populations during a hundred days, followed by a steady decrease in a way that depends on the cost associated to a such control. The isolation of the younger population is weaker and occurs only if the cost associated with the control is relatively low. We show that the optimal control strategy strongly outperforms other strategies such as uniform constant control over the whole populations or over its younger fraction.

Methods and findings: The Corona Sao Caetano program is a primary care initiative offering COVID-19 care to all residents of Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil. After triage of potentially severe cases, consecutive patients presenting between 13th April and 13th May 2020 were tested at home with SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR; positive patients were followed up for 14 days. RT-PCR-negative patients were offered SARS-CoV-2 serology. We describe the clinical features, virology and natural history of this prospective population-based cohort. Of 2,073 suspected COVID-19 cases, 1,583 (76.4%) were tested by RT-PCR, of whom 444 (28.0%, 95%CI: 25.9% - 30.3%) were positive; 604\/1,136 (53%) RT-PCR-negative patients underwent serology, of whom 52 (8.6%) tested SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were cough, fatigue, myalgia and headache; whereas self-reported fever, anosmia, and ageusia were most associated with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. RT-PCR cycle thresholds were lower in men, older patients, those with fever and arthralgia, and around symptom onset. The rates of hospitalization and death among 444 RT-PCR-positive cases were 6.7% and 0.7%, respectively, with older age and obesity more frequent in the hospitalized group. Conclusions: COVID-19 presents similarly to other mild respiratory disease in primary care. Some symptoms assist the differential diagnosis. Most patients can be managed at home.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabio E Leal","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maria C Mendes-Correa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lewis F Buss","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49)  and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sa"},{"author_name":"Silvia F Costa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Joao CS Bizario","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sonia RP Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Osorio Thomaz","author_inst":"Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnologicas do Estado de Sao Paulo - IPT"},{"author_name":"Tania R Tozetto-Mendoza","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lucy S Villas-Boas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lea CO Silva","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Regina MZ Grespan","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Rua Santo Antonio, Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ligia Capuani","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Renata Buccheri","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Helves Domingues","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Neal DE Alexander","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Philippe Mayaud","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49)  and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sa"},{"author_name":"Ronald Sjoberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanna Tegel","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137901","rel_title":"Factors associated with self-reported anxiety, depression, and general health during the UK lockdown; a cross-sectional survey","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137901","rel_abs":"Background: To investigate factors associated with anxiety, depression, and self-reported general health during \"lockdown\" due to COVID-19 in the UK. Methods: Online cross-sectional survey of a nationally-representative sample of 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over (data collected 6-7 May 2020). Participants were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. Outcomes: In this sample, 21.9% (n=458, 95% CI [20.1% to 23.7%]) reported probable anxiety (scored three or over on the GAD-2); while 23.5% (n=494, 95% CI [21.7% to 25.3]) reported probable depression (scored three or over on the PHQ-2). Poorer mental health was associated with greater financial hardship during the lockdown, thinking that you would lose contact with friends or family if you followed Government measures, more conflict with household members during the lockdown, less sense of community with people in your neighbourhood, and lower perceived effectiveness of Government measures. Females and those who were younger were likely to report higher levels of anxiety and depression. The majority of participants reported their general health as \"good\" (as measured by the first item of the SF-36). Poorer self-reported general health was associated with psychological distress, greater worry about COVID-19 and markers of inequality. Interpretation: Rates of self-reported anxiety and depression in the UK during the lockdown were greater than population norms. Reducing financial hardship, promoting social connectedness, and increasing solidarity with neighbours and household members may help ease rifts within the community which are associated with distress, thereby improving mental health. Reducing inequality may also improve general health.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise E.

It has been responsible for over four hundred thousand death worldwide to date. There has been evidence that various comorbidities have a higher risk associated with case fatality. Although COVID-19 is a viral disease, there might be an association between different comorbidities and the occurrence of the disease. Method: Sociodemographic and medical history data on different comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, liver disease, lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and obesity were collected by a web-based self-reported survey between 25th March 2020 to 4th June 2020 by the Nexoid United Kingdom. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done using these risk factors as independent variables. Result: A total of 780,961 participants from 183 different countries and territories participated in this study. Among them, 1516 participants were diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to this study. A significant risk association was observed for age above 60 years, female gender as well as different pre-existing disease conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, and heart diseases. Asthma and diabetes were the major dominant comorbidities among patients, and patients with existing diabetes were 1.464 (AOR: 1.464; 95% CI: 1.228-1.744), more likely to develop the disease than others who did not diagnose as diseased. Conclusion: Older adults, female as well as people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, kidney disease, and liver disease, are the most vulnerable population for COVID-19. However, further studies should be carried out to explain the pathway of these risk associations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Rahanur Alam","author_inst":"Department of Food Technology and Nutrition Science, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

However, building a robust image classification model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, we called Self Supervised Super Sample Decomposition for Transfer learning (4S-DT) model. 4S-DT encourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is a novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample decomposition of unlabelled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT helps in improving the robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with a class decomposition layer to simplify the local structure of the data. 4S-DT can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a downstream classdecomposition mechanism. We used 50,000 unlabelled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. 4S-DT has achieved a high accuracy of 99:8% (95% CI: 99.44 %, 99.98%) in the detection of COVID-19 cases on a large dataset and an accuracy of 97:54% (95% CI: 96.22%, 98.91%) on an extended test set enriched by augmented images of a small dataset, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected, which was the highest accuracy obtained when compared to other methods.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asmaa Abbas","author_inst":"Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Abdelsamea","author_inst":"Birmingham City University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Gaber","author_inst":"Birmingham City University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Robin","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tania R Tozetto-Mendoza","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lucy S Villas-Boas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lea CO Silva","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Regina MZ Grespan","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Rua Santo Antonio, Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ligia Capuani","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Renata Buccheri","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Helves Domingues","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Neal DE Alexander","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Philippe Mayaud","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49)  and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sa"},{"author_name":"Ronald Sjoberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanna Tegel","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137257","rel_title":"Cost-effectiveness and return on investment of protecting health workers in low- and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137257","rel_abs":"Background: In this paper, we predict the health and economic consequences of immediate investment in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers (HCWs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: To account for health consequences, we estimated mortality for health care workers (HCW), and present a cost-effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) analysis using a decision-analytic model with Bayesian multivariate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Inputs were used from the World Health Organization Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool and the Imperial College of London epidemiologic model. Results: An investment of $9.6 billion USD would adequately protect HCWs in all LMICs. This intervention saves 2,299,543 lives across LMICs, costing $59 USD per HCW case averted and $4,309 USD per HCW life saved. The societal ROI is $755.3 billion USD, the equivalent of a 7,932% return. Regional and national estimates are also presented. In scenarios where PPE remains scarce, 70-100% of HCWs will get infected, irrespective of nationwide social distancing policies. Maintaining HCW infection rates below 10% and mortality below 1% requires inclusion of a PPE scale-up strategy as part of the pandemic response. Discussion: In conclusion, wide-scale procurement and distribution of PPE for LMICs is an essential strategy to prevent widespread HCW morbidity and mortality. It is cost-effective and yields a large downstream ROI.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas Risko","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Kalin Werner","author_inst":"University of Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"O Agatha Offorjebe","author_inst":"University of South California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, USA"},{"author_name":"Andres I Vecino-Ortiz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lee A Wallis","author_inst":"University of Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Junaid Razzak","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Schoolof Medicine"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tania R Tozetto-Mendoza","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lucy S Villas-Boas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lea CO Silva","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Regina MZ Grespan","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Rua Santo Antonio, Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ligia Capuani","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Renata Buccheri","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Helves Domingues","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Neal DE Alexander","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Philippe Mayaud","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49)  and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sa"},{"author_name":"Ronald Sjoberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanna Tegel","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137133","rel_title":"Qualitative forecast and temporal evolution ofthe disease spreading using a simplified modeland COVID-19 data for Italy","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137133","rel_abs":"In a previous paper a simplified SEIR model applied to COVID-19 cases detected in Italy, including the lockdown period, has shown a good fitting to the time evolution of the disease during the observed period.

Platelets are chiefly implicated in thrombosis. Moreover, they can interact with viruses and are an important source of inflammatory mediators. While a lower platelet count is associated with severity and mortality, little is known about platelet function during COVID-19. Objective: To evaluate the contribution of platelets to inflammation and thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods and Results: We document the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in platelets of COVID-19 patients. Exhaustive assessment of cytokines in plasma and in platelets revealed the modulation of platelet-associated cytokine levels in COVID-19, pointing to a direct contribution of platelets to the plasmatic cytokine load. Moreover, we demonstrate that platelets release their alpha- and dense-granule contents and phosphatidylserine-exposing extracellular vesicles. Functionally, platelets were hyperactivated in COVID-19 subjects, with aggregation occurring at suboptimal thrombin concentrations. Furthermore, platelets adhered more efficiently onto collagen-coated surfaces under flow conditions. Conclusions: These data suggest that platelets could participate in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and in the overwhelming thrombo-inflammation observed in COVID-19. Thus, blockade of platelet activation pathways may improve outcomes in this disease.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Younes Zaid","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital; Mohammed V University"},{"author_name":"Florian Puhm","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Allaeys","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Abdallah Naya","author_inst":"Hassan II University"},{"author_name":"Mounia Oudghiri","author_inst":"Hassan II University"},{"author_name":"Loubna Khalki","author_inst":"Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS)"},{"author_name":"Youness Limami","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nabil Zaid","author_inst":"Mohammed V University"},{"author_name":"Khalid Sadki","author_inst":"Mohammed V University"},{"author_name":"Rafiqua Ben El Haj","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wissal Maher","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lamiae Belayachi","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bouchra Belefquih","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amina Benouda","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amine Cheikh","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yahia Cherrah","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Louis Flamand","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Fadila Guessous","author_inst":"Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Eric Boilard","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137521","rel_title":"SARS CoV-2 Serosurvey in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137521","rel_abs":"In a serosurvey of asymptomatic people recruited from a clinical laboratory in the general population in May, 2020 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia three out of 99 persons tested positive for SARS CoV-2 IgG (3.03%, 95% binomial exact confidence interval: 0.63%-8.6%).

This paper compares the dynamics of virus-receptor interactions for SARS-CoV (CoV1) and CoV2. At low (endosomal) pH, the binding free energy landscape of CoV1 and CoV2 interactions with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is almost the same. However, at neutral pH the landscape is different due to the loss of a pH-switch (His445Lys) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of CoV2 relative to CoV1. Namely, CoV1 stabilizes a transition state above the bound state. In situations where small external strains are applied by, say, shear flow in the respiratory system, the off rate of the viral particle is enhanced. As a result, CoV1 virions are expected to detach from cell surfaces in time scales that are much faster than the time needed for other receptors to reach out and stabilize virus attachment. On the other hand, the loss of this pH-switch, which sequence alignments show is unique to CoV2, eliminates the transition state and allows the virus to stay bound to the ACE2 receptor for time scales compatible with the recruitment of additional ACE2 receptors diffusing in the cell membrane. This has important implications for viral infection and its pathology. CoV1 does not trigger high infectivity in the nasal area because it either rapidly drifts down the respiratory tract or is exhaled. By contrast, this novel mutation in CoV2 should not only retain the infection in the nasal cavity until ACE2-rich cells are sufficiently depleted, but also require fewer particles for infection. This mechanism explains observed longer incubation times, extended period of viral shedding, and higher rate of transmission. These considerations governing viral entry suggest that number of ACE2-rich cells in human nasal mucosa, which should be significantly smaller for children (and females relative to males), should also correlate with onset of viral load that could be a determinant of higher virus susceptibility. Critical implications for the development of new vaccines to combat current and future pandemics that, like SARS-CoV2, export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates by viral retention in nasal epithelium are also discussed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos J.

Here, we propose climate plays an important role in the evolution of SARS CoV-2 and the spread of COVID-19 all over the world which was previously not known. To understand the climatic factors responsible for shaping the molecular determinants of the novel coronavirus, genotyping SARS CoV-2 across different latitudes and Koppens climate is imperative. It seems this virus follows inverse latitudinal biodiversity gradient due to its preference towards Koppens temperate (C) and cold climate (D). Our molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed division of 176 SARS CoV-2 strains into two variant groups, G1 and G2, well defined by four mutations. Initially, SARS CoV-2 was restricted to a \"humid-subtropical\" (Cfa) climate of southeast China, which soon spread all over the world having C climate. Genomic information superimposed on global Koppens climate map elucidates that the gradation \"humid-subtropical\" (Cfa) and \"marine-temperate\" (Cfb) to \"humid-continental\" (Dfa-Dfb) climate drives the evolution of G1 into G2 variant group. It seems an early infection in Europe and USA is due to the dominance of C climate. Russia and North America were infected through linkage of C to D climate and South America from C to A climate. Our study elucidates viruses are sensitive to climate and combined genomic and climatic studies provide crucial information about the pathogenesis and natural spreading pathways during a pandemic which will enable us to take pre-emptive precautionary measures in such outbreaks.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nIn BriefThe authors elucidate adaptation of SARS CoV-2 to different climates by studying phylogenetics and the distribution of strains on Koppens climate map.\n\nHighlightsO_LISARS CoV-2 follows inverse latitudinal gradient.\nC_LIO_LIPhylogenetic network divides SARS CoV-2 strains into two variant groups, G1 and G2.\nC_LIO_LIG1 strains is restricted to Koppens \"temperate\" climate (mainly Cfa-Cfb).\nC_LIO_LIG2 strains has evolved from G1 to sustain in \"humid-continental\" (Dfa-Dfb) and \"tropical-savannah\" (Aw) climate.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Priyanka Bajaj","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Prakash Chandra Arya","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ulises Santiago","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mesfin Nigussie Difabachew","author_inst":"International Clinical Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Kempen","author_inst":"MyungSung Christian Medical Center (MCM) Eye Unit, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Melaku Tesfaye Debele","author_inst":"International Clinical Laboratories, Addis Ababa"},{"author_name":"Abel A Menkir","author_inst":"MyungSung Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Maranatha T Assefa","author_inst":"MyungSung Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Eyob H Asfaw","author_inst":"MyungSung Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Leul B Habtegabriel","author_inst":"MyungSung Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Yohannes Sitotaw Addisie","author_inst":"Ethiopia Biotechnology Institute"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nilles","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Joseph Craig Longenecker","author_inst":"Kuwait University, Health Sciences Center, Faculty of Medicine; Faculty of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amina Benouda","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amine Cheikh","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yahia Cherrah","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Louis Flamand","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Fadila Guessous","author_inst":"Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Eric Boilard","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.150482","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 mutations altering regulatory properties: deciphering host's and virus's perspectives","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.150482","rel_abs":"Since the first recorded case of the SARS-CoV-2, it has acquired several mutations in its genome while spreading throughout the globe. However, apart from some changes in protein coding, functional importance of these mutations in disease pathophysiology are still largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the significance of these mutations both from the hosts and viruss perspective by analyzing the host miRNA binding and viruss internal ribosome entry site (IRES), respectively. Strikingly, we observed that due to the acquired mutations, host miRNAs bind differently compared to the reference; where few of the miRNAs lost and few gained the binding affinity for targeting the viral genome. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these gained and lost miRNAs might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Also, we sought to shed some insights on the impacts of mutations on the IRES structure of SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, we detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into the differences observed different parts of the world.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abul B.M.M.K.
