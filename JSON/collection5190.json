Sufficient testing for SARS-CoV-2 remains essential for tracking and containing the rapid spread of the virus. However, due to increased global demand, kits and proprietary reagents for RNA extraction are limited, which markedly reduce SARS-CoV-2 testing capabilities in many countries. Here, we explore the use of conventional acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (AGPC)-based RNA purification as an alternative to commercial automated systems for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. 87 clinical oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens were extracted by AGPC and compared to the commercial platforms, the Maxwell(R) RSC 48 instrument for automated RNA extraction and the fully integrated diagnostic system, the Cobas(R)6800 apparatus. Our results show that RNA extracted using the AGPC method is fully comparable to modern automated systems regarding analytical sensitivity, specificity and accuracy with respect to detection of SARS-CoV-2 as evaluated by RT-qPCR. Moreover, we find that the AGPC method is easily scalable and implemented in conventional laboratories. Taken together, these data identify conventional AGPC-based RNA extraction as a low cost and suitable alternative to automated systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, when automated systems, kits and reagents are not readily available.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Henrik Dimke","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Sanne L Larsen","author_inst":"Odense University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marianne N Skov","author_inst":"Odense University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hanne Larsen","author_inst":"Odense University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gitte N Hartmeyer","author_inst":"Odense University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jesper B Moeller","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113480","rel_title":"Frailty and mortality in hospitalized older adults with COVID-19: retrospective observational study","rel_date":"2020-05-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113480","rel_abs":"Background: Older adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) face an increased risk of adverse health outcomes including mortality. Ethical guidelines consider allocation of limited resources based on likelihood of survival, frailty, co-morbidities and age. However, the association of frailty with clinical outcomes in older COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Objectives: To determine the association between frailty and short-term mortality in older adults hospitalized for COVID-19. Design: Retrospective single-center observational study. Setting and participants: N = 81 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the Geriatrics department of Imelda general hospital, Belgium. Measurements: Frailty was graded according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Demographic, biochemical and radiological variables, co-morbidities, symptoms and treatment were extracted from electronic medical records. Results: Participants (N = 48 women, 59%) had a median age of 85 years (range 65 - 97 years), median CFS score of 7 (range 2 - 9), and 42 (52%) were long-term care residents. Within six weeks, eighteen patients died. Mortality was significantly but weakly associated with age (Spearman r = 0.241, P = 0.03) and CFS score (r = 0.282, P = 0.011), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (r = 0.301, P = 0.009), lymphocyte count (r = -0.262, P = 0.02) and RT-PCR Ct value (r = -0.285, P = 0.015). Mortality was not associated with long-term care residence, dementia, delirium or polypharmacy. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CFS, LDH and RT-PCR Ct values (but not age) remained independently associated with mortality. Both age and frailty had poor specificity to predict survival. A multivariable model combining age, CFS, LDH and viral load significantly predicted survival. Conclusions and implications: Although their prognosis is worse, even the oldest and most severely frail patients may benefit from hospitalization for COVID-19, if sufficient resources are available.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert De Smet","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Bea Mellaerts","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Hannelore Vandewinckele","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Peter Lybeert","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Eric Frans","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Sara Ombelet","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Lemahieu","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Rolf Symons","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Erwin Ho","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Johan Frans","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Annick Smismans","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Michael R Laurent","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"geriatric medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20112664","rel_title":"For-profit nursing homes and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks and resident deaths in Ontario, Canada","rel_date":"2020-05-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20112664","rel_abs":"Background: Nursing homes have become the epicentre of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada. Previous research demonstrates that for-profit nursing homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether for-profit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than non-profit homes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all nursing homes in Ontario, Canada from March 29-May 20, 2020 using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between nursing home profit status (for-profit, non-profit or municipal) and nursing home COVID-19 outbreaks, COVID-19 outbreak sizes, and COVID-19 resident deaths. Results: The analysis included all 623 Ontario nursing homes, of which 360 (57.7%) were for-profit, 162 (26.0%) were non-profit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) COVID-19 nursing home outbreaks involving 5218 residents (mean of 27.5 +\/- 41.3 residents per home), resulting in 1452 deaths (mean of 7.6 +\/- 12.7 residents per home) with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak was associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the health region surrounding a nursing home (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-3.09) and number of beds (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI 1.20-1.63), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the size of a nursing home outbreak (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.96; 95% CI 1.26-3.05) and the number of resident deaths (aRR, 1.78; 95% CI 1.03-3.07), compared to non-profit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older nursing home design standards in for-profit homes. Interpretation: For-profit status is associated with the size of a COVID-19 nursing home outbreak and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for profit and non-profit homes are largely explained by older design standards, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathan M.

Developing models to quantify the risk of poor outcomes in infected patients could help develop strategies to shield the most vulnerable during de-confinement. Objective To develop and externally validate COVID-19 Estimated Risk (COVER) scores that quantify a patient's risk of hospital admission (COVER-H), requiring intensive services (COVER-I), or fatality (COVER-F) in the 30-days following COVID-19 diagnosis. Design Multinational, distributed network cohorts. Setting We analyzed a federated network of electronic medical records and administrative claims data from 13 data sources and 6 countries, mapped to a common data model. Participants Model development used a patient population consisting of >2 million patients with a general practice (GP), emergency room (ER), or outpatient (OP) visit with diagnosed influenza or flu-like symptoms any time prior to 2020. The model was validated on patients with a GP, ER, or OP visit in 2020 with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis across four databases from South Korea, Spain and the United States. Outcomes Age, sex, historical conditions, and drug use prior to index date were considered as candidate predictors. Outcomes included i) hospitalization with pneumonia, ii) hospitalization with pneumonia requiring intensive services or death, and iii) death in the 30 days after index date. Results Overall, 43,061 COVID-19 patients were included for model validation, after initial model development and validation using 6,869,127 patients with influenza or flu-like symptoms. We identified 7 predictors (history of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and kidney disease) which combined with age and sex could discriminate which patients would experience any of our three outcomes. The models achieved high performance in influenza. When transported to COVID-19 cohorts, the AUC ranges were, COVER-H: 0.73-0.81, COVER-I: 0.73-0.91, and COVER-F: 0.82-0.90. Calibration was overall acceptable, with overestimated risk in the most elderly and highest risk strata. Conclusions and relevance A 9-predictor model performs well for COVID-19 patients for predicting hospitalization, intensive services and death. The models could aid in providing reassurance for low risk patients and shield high risk patients from COVID-19 during de-confinement to reduce the virus' impact on morbidity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ross D.

In order to evaluate the early indicators for true lethality and recovery time, the data where the model is built must be quality checked. Each country sets different procedures and criteria for fatality count due to COVID-19 and the health system is stressed by having insufficient testing, untracked patients and premature discharge. In this paper the dynamics behind such data quality issues are discussed throughout the disease course to support better modeling and decision-making processes in a stressed healthcare system. From 593.291 cases in the sample, and its 7 representative groups, the recovery time and the local CFR are negatively correlated, having the highest fatality rates (21%, Spain) the countries with shorter recovery time (11 days, Spain). Also, CFR can be an indicator of Infection inconsistencies (i.e. South Korea, CFR 1%, Time to recovery 25 days). At the review part, focus is made on the inconsistencies detected in Germany and South Korea datasets as well as the potential misfits on China and Spain. Overall, the Time to Fatality ranges between 4 and 8 days, and the mean is of 6 days (South Korea, 7 days; Japan, 6days). Only Germany and France are detecting earlier than other countries and admit 10 days before fatality occurs. One simple explanation for the local CFR and Recovery time correlation is to define such rate as a measure of the healthcare system overload. Anomalous CFR indexes point to a stressed healthcare system. The higher the overload, the more focus on critical cases and hence the higher local CFR. The COVID-19 intrinsic CFR is unlikely to change by a factor of 10x from countries with similar lifestyle, GDP per capita and health services (i.e. the Mediterranean Basin, Northern Europe, etc.). Because of this fact, early CFR measured before Healthcare system overwhelming (COVID-19 free flow) are considered to be more accurate than the measured CFR while the outbreak is still ongoing, Finally, the synthetic Infection indexes may be a helpful indirect measure of the real population infection rate and also used for data quality audit. Any model built upon inconsistent data will be complex to explain and justify.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oriol Gallemi Rovira","author_inst":"Universitat Ramon Llull IQS"},{"author_name":"Aniek F.

However, the sensitivity of real time RT-PCR tests is low and it can take up to 8 hours to receive the test results. Radiologic methods can provide higher sensitivity. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of X-ray and convolutional neural networks for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to differentiate it from viral and\/or bacterial pneumonia, as 2-class (bacterial pneumonia vs COVID-19 and viral pneumonia vs COVID-19) and 3-class (bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19, and healthy group (BCH), and among viral pneumonia, COVID-19, and healthy group (VCH)) experiments. METHODS 225 COVID-19, 1,583 healthy control, 2,780 bacterial pneumonia, and 1,493 viral pneumonia chest X-ray images were used. 2-class- and 3-class-experiments were performed with different convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architectures, with different variations of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. RESULTS The results showed that bacterial pneumonia vs COVID-19 and viral pneumonia vs COVID-19 reached a mean ROC AUC of 97.32% and 96.80%, respectively. In the 3-class-experiments, macro-average F1 scores of 95.79% and 94.59% were obtained in terms of detecting COVID-19 among BCH and VCH, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The ConvNet was able to distinguish the COVID-19 images among non-COVID-19 images, namely bacterial and viral pneumonia as well as normal X-ray images.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ilker Ozsahin","author_inst":"Near East University"},{"author_name":"Confidence Onyebuchi","author_inst":"Cyprus International University"},{"author_name":"Boran Sekeroglu","author_inst":"Near East University"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte Salles","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Scott L Duvall","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs, USA; University of Utah, USA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Falconer","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Jitendra Jonnagaddala","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Chungsoo Kim","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ajou University Graduate School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Yeunsook Rho","author_inst":"Department of Bigdata, Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Andrew Williams","author_inst":"Tufts Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Boston, MA, 02111, USA"},{"author_name":"Amanda Alberga","author_inst":"Independent Epidemiologist, OHDSI"},{"author_name":"Min Ho An","author_inst":"Wando county health center and hospital"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Arag\u00f3n","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Young Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Iannis Drakos","author_inst":"Center for Surgical Science, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Maria Fernandes Abrah\u00e3o","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez-Bertol\u00edn","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark  NNF Centre for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

In response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic, Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood. We conducted a real-life study to evaluate the performance of two RDTs, COVID-PRESTO and COVID-DUO, compared to the gold standard, RT-PCR. Methods RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 was performed from nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in adult patients visiting the infectious disease department at the hospital (Orleans, France). Fingertip whole blood samples taken at different time points after onset of the disease were tested with RDTs. The specificity and sensitivity of the rapid test kits compared to test of reference (RT-PCR) were calculated. Results Among 381 patients with symptoms of COVID-19 who went to the hospital for a diagnostic, 143 patients were RT-PCR negative. Results of test with RDTs were all negative for these patients, indicating a specificity of 100% for both RDTs. In the RT-PCR positive subgroup (n=238), 133 patients were tested with COVID-PRESTO and 129 patients were tested with COVID-DUO (24 patients tested with both). The further the onset of symptoms was from the date of collection, the greater the sensitivity. The sensitivity of COVID-PRESTO test ranged from 10.00% for patients having experienced their 1st symptoms from 0 to 5 days ago to 100% in patients where symptoms had occurred more than 15 days before the date of tests. For COVID-DUO test, the sensitivity ranged from 35.71% [0-5 days] to 100% (> 15 days). Conclusion COVID-PRESTO and DUO RDTs turned out to be very specific (none false positive) and to be sensitive enough after 15 days from onset of symptom. These easy to use IgG\/IgM combined test kits are the first ones allowing a screening with capillary blood sample, by typing from a finger prick. These rapid tests are particularly interesting for screening in low resource settings.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thierry Prazuck","author_inst":"CHR Orleans, Department of infectious and tropical diseases"},{"author_name":"Mathilda Colin","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Susanna Giache","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Camelia Gubavu","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Aymeric Seve","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rzepecki","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Marie Chevereau-Choquet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases"},{"author_name":"Catherine Kiani","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Victor Rodi","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lyonnet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Laura Courtellemont","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jerome Guinard","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Gilles Pialoux","author_inst":"Department of infectious diseases, Hopital Tenon"},{"author_name":"Laurent Hocqueloux","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Young Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Iannis Drakos","author_inst":"Center for Surgical Science, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Maria Fernandes Abrah\u00e3o","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez-Bertol\u00edn","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark  NNF Centre for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

Effect of temperature is negative, and humidity is found to have no impact on number of cases, using the fixed effects model on city-level panel data. The next model utilises exponential smoothing for projecting current trend, deviation from which potentially indicates peak arrival or downturn in days to come. Lastly, multiple iterations of compartmental modelling, lockdown scenarios, indicating nearly 44.06% increase in number of cases due to untimely end of lockdown in June, the prediction being highly sensitive to model assumptions.

For other respiratory tract infections community hand hygiene interventions are supported by evidence from randomised trials, but information on how effectiveness in reducing transmission scales with achieved changes in hand hygiene behaviour is lacking. This information is of critical importance when considering the potential value of substantially enhancing community hand hygiene frequency to help suppress COVID-19. Here, we developed a simple model-based framework for understanding the key determinants of the effectiveness of changes in hand hygiene behaviour in reducing transmission and use it to explore the potential impact of interventions aimed at achieving large-scale population-wide changes in hand hygiene behaviour. Our analyses show that the effect of hand hygiene is highly dependent on the duration of viral persistence on hands and that hand washing needs to be performed very frequently or immediately after hand contamination events in order to substantially reduce the probability of infection. Hand washing at a lower frequency, such as every 30 minutes or with a delay of 15 minutes after contamination events, may be adequate to reduce the probability of infection when viral survival on hands is longer, such as when hands are contaminated with mucus. Immediate hand washing after contamination is more effective than hand washing at fixed-time intervals even when the total number of hand washing events is similar. This event-prompted hand washing strategy is consistently more effective than fixed-time strategy regardless of hand contamination rates and should be highlighted in hand hygiene campaigns.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thi Mui Pham","author_inst":"Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care of the UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Yin Mo","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ben Cooper","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Camelia Gubavu","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Aymeric Seve","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rzepecki","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Marie Chevereau-Choquet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases"},{"author_name":"Catherine Kiani","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Victor Rodi","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lyonnet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Laura Courtellemont","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jerome Guinard","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Gilles Pialoux","author_inst":"Department of infectious diseases, Hopital Tenon"},{"author_name":"Laurent Hocqueloux","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Young Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Iannis Drakos","author_inst":"Center for Surgical Science, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Maria Fernandes Abrah\u00e3o","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez-Bertol\u00edn","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark  NNF Centre for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

The situation is even worse for emerging economies like India. WHO recommends mass scale testing as one of the most effective ways to contain its spread and fight the pandemic. But, due to the high cost and shortage of test kits, specifically in India, the testing is restricted to only those who are symptomatic. In this context, pooled testing is recommended by some experts as a partial solution to overcome this problem. In this article, we explain the basic statistical theory behind the pooled testing procedure for screening as well as prevalence estimation. In real world situations, the tests are imperfect, and lead to false positive and false negative results. We provide theoretical explanation of the impact of these diagnostic errors on the performances of individual testing and pooled testing procedures. Finally, we study the effect of misspecification of sensitivity and specificity of tests on the estimate of prevalence, an issue, which is debated a lot among the scientists in the context of COVID-19. Our theoretical investigations lead to some interesting and precise understanding of some of these issues.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pritha Guha","author_inst":"XLRI-Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur, Jharkhand-831001, India"},{"author_name":"Apratim Guha","author_inst":"XLRI-Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur, Jharkhand-831001, India"},{"author_name":"Tathagata Bandyopadhyay","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, Gujarat-380015, India"},{"author_name":"Camelia Gubavu","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Aymeric Seve","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rzepecki","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Marie Chevereau-Choquet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases"},{"author_name":"Catherine Kiani","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Victor Rodi","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lyonnet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Laura Courtellemont","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jerome Guinard","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Gilles Pialoux","author_inst":"Department of infectious diseases, Hopital Tenon"},{"author_name":"Laurent Hocqueloux","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Young Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Iannis Drakos","author_inst":"Center for Surgical Science, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Maria Fernandes Abrah\u00e3o","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez-Bertol\u00edn","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark  NNF Centre for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

Diagnostics which detect active asymptomatic infection, which are suitable for monitoring and surveillance, may be of benefit to the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) elimination campaign on the ISC. Methodology\/Principal Findings: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the direct agglutination test (DAT), and the Leishmania antigen ELISA were carried out on blood and urine samples collected from 720 household and neighbouring contacts of 276 VL and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) index cases, with no symptoms or history of VL and PKDL, in endemic regions of Bangladesh between September 2016 and March 2018. Of the 720 contacts of index cases, asymptomatic infection was detected in 69 (9.6%) participants by a combination of qPCR (1.0%), LAMP (2.1%), DAT (3.9%), and Leishmania antigen ELISA (3.3%). Only 1 (0.1%) participant was detected positive by all 4 diagnostic tests. Poor agreement between tests was calculated using Cohen's kappa statistics, however the Leishmania antigen ELISA and DAT in combination capture all participants positive by more than one test. We find strong evidence for association between the index case being a PKDL case (OR 1.94, p = 0.009), specifically macular PKDL (OR 2.12, p = 0.004) and being positive for at least one of the four tests. Conclusions\/Significance: Leishmania antigen ELISA detects active asymptomatic infection, requires a non-invasive sample, and therefore may be of benefit for monitoring transmission and surveillance in an elimination setting in combination with serology. Development of an antigen detection test in RDT format would be of benefit to the elimination campaign.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sophie I Owen","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Faria Hossain","author_inst":"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Prakash Ghosh","author_inst":"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Rajashree Chowdhury","author_inst":"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

A coefficient (slope of the meta-regression line) for COVID-19 prevalence was significantly negative for male sex, education attainment, computer and Internet use, and private health insurance. Whereas, the coefficient was significantly positive for black race, never matrimony, unemployment, and poverty. In the multivariable model, the coefficient was significantly negative for male sex (P = 0.036) and computer use (P = 0.024), and significantly positive for never matrimony (P < 0.001). A coefficient for COVID-19 fatality was significantly negative for no health insurance, and significantly positive for elderly, unemployment, and public coverage. In the multivariable model, the coefficient was significantly positive for only elderly (P = 0.002).

Attention initially focussed on severe presentations, intensive care capacity, and the timely supply of equipment. General practice has seen a rapid take up of technology to allow virtual consultations, enabling the management of mild and moderate community cases. Aim To quantify the prevalence and time-course of suspected COVID-19 presenting to general practices during the London epidemic. To report disease prevalence by ethnic group, and explore how far differences by ethnicity can be explained by data in the electronic health record (EHR). Design and Setting Cross-sectional study using anonymised data from the primary care records of 1.3 million people registered with 157 practices in four adjacent east London clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). The study area includes 48% of people from ethnic minorities and is in the top decile of social deprivation in England. Method Suspected COVID-19 cases were identified using SNOMED codes. Explanatory variables included age, gender, self-reported ethnicity and measures of social deprivation. Clinical factors included 16 long-term conditions, latest body mass index and smoking status. Results There were 8,985 suspected COVID-19 cases. Ethnicity recording was 78% complete. Univariate analysis showed a two-fold increase in odds of infection for South Asian and Black adults compared to White. In a fully adjusted analysis, including clinical factors, the odds were: South Asian OR 1.93 (95% CI = 1.83 to 2.04) Black OR 1.47 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.57) Conclusions Using data in GP records Black and south Asian ethnicity remain as predictors of community cases of COVID-19, with levels of risk similar to hospital admission cases. Further understanding of these differences requires social and occupational data.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sally A Hull","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Crystal Williams","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Mark Ashworth","author_inst":"School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Chris Carvalho","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Kambiz Boomla","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Marie Herring","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Hardik Kabaria","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc"},{"author_name":"Christina Kong","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Blane Larson","author_inst":"Resolution Medical, LLC"},{"author_name":"Owen Lu","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Arielle Maxner","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Elle Meyer","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shawn Patterson","author_inst":"Resolution Medical, LLC."},{"author_name":"Steve Pollack","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jason Rolland","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Steven Schmidt","author_inst":"Resolution Medical, LLC"},{"author_name":"Sridhar Seshadri","author_inst":"Stanford Health Care"},{"author_name":"Keshav Swarup","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Chelsey Thomas","author_inst":"Stanford Health Care"},{"author_name":"Ryan Van Wert","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark  NNF Centre for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

Design: An outbreak investigation. Setting: 4 nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. Participants: 394 residents and 70 staff in nursing homes. Interventions: Two point-prevalence surveys one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Main outcome measures: All-cause mortality, and mortality attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms in residents and staff. Results: Overall, 26% (95% confidence interval 22 to 31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70 to 336). Systematic testing identified 40% (95% CI 35 to 46) of residents, of whom 43% (95% CI 34 to 52) were asymptomatic and 18% (95% CI 11 to 24) had atypical symptoms, as well as 4% (95% CI -1 to 9) of asymptomatic staff who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was associated with a very high mortality rate in residents of nursing homes. Systematic testing of all residents and a representative sample of staff identified high rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity across the four nursing homes, highlighting a potential for regular screening to prevent future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neil SN Graham","author_inst":"UK DRI Centre for Care Research and Technology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Junghans","author_inst":"Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rawlda Downes","author_inst":"Department of Elderly Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital, London W6 8RF, UK"},{"author_name":"Catherine Sendall","author_inst":"Department of Elderly Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital, London W6 8RF, UK"},{"author_name":"Helen Lai","author_inst":"UK DRI Centre for Care Research and Technology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Annie McKirdy","author_inst":"5.\tNorth West London Health Protection Team, Public Health England, 61 Colindale Avenue, Colindale, London NW9 5EQ"},{"author_name":"Paul Elliott","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Robert Howard","author_inst":"Division of Psychiatry, UCL, 149 Tottenham Court Road, London W1T 7NF"},{"author_name":"David Wingfield","author_inst":"Department of Metabolism, Digestion & Reproduction, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Miles Priestman","author_inst":"London Biofoundry, Imperial College Translation & Innovation Hub, White City Campus, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Marta Ciechonska","author_inst":"London Biofoundry, Imperial College Translation & Innovation Hub, White City Campus, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Loren Cameron","author_inst":"Section of Structural and Synthetic Biology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Marko Storch","author_inst":"London Biofoundry, Imperial College Translation & Innovation Hub, White City Campus, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Crone","author_inst":"London Biofoundry, Imperial College Translation & Innovation Hub, White City Campus, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Freemont","author_inst":"London Biofoundry, Imperial College Translation & Innovation Hub, White City Campus, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"North West London Pathology, Charing Cross Hospital, London W6 8RF, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert McLaren","author_inst":"Park Medical Centre, Hammersmith, London W6 0QG"},{"author_name":"Nicola Lang","author_inst":"Hammersmith & Fulham Council, 3 Shortlands, Hammersmith W6 8DA"},{"author_name":"Shamez Ladhani","author_inst":"Immunisation and Countermeasures Division, Public Health England, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Frances Sanderson","author_inst":"Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital, London W6 8RF, UK"},{"author_name":"David J Sharp","author_inst":"UK Dementia Research Institute Centre for Care Research and Technology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

The dynamics of the model are influenced by the number of asymptomatic cases, hospitalization requirements and mortality due to the disease. A locally-informed model was determined using actual hospitalization records. Together with cases and casualty data, optimized estimates for model parameters were obtained within a metaheuristic framework based on Particle Swarm Optimization. Our strategy is supported by a statistical sensitivity analysis on the model parameters, adequate to properly account for the simulated scenarios. First, we evaluated the effect of previously enforced interventions on the transmission rate. Then, we studied its effects on the number of deaths as well as hospitalization requirements, considering the state as a whole. Special attention is given to the impact of asymptomatic individuals on the dynamic of COVID-19 transmission, as these were estimated to contribute to a 68% increase in the basic reproductive number. Finally, we delineated scenarios that can set guides to protect the health care system, particularly by keeping demand below total bed occupancy. Our results underscore the challenges related to maintaining a fully capable health infrastructure during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, specially in a low-resource setting such as the one focused in this work. The evidences produced by our modelling-based analysis show that decreasing the transmission rate is paramount to success in maintaining health resources availability, but that current local efforts, leading to a 38% decrease in the transmission rate, are still insufficient to prevent its collapse at peak demand. Carefully planned and timely applied interventions, that result in stark decreases in transmission rate, were found to be the most effective in preventing hospital bed shortages for the longest periods.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juliane Fonseca Oliveira","author_inst":"Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health, Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Daniel C.

Methods: We evaluated the risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients living with cancer compared to the general community and whether cancer-related treatments influence this risk. Data were collected from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application since March 24, 2020 (United Kingdom), March 29 (U.S.), and April 29, 2020 (Sweden) through May 8, 2020. We used multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of a positive COVID-19 test as well as predicted COVID-19 infection using a validated symptom model. Results: Among 23,266 participants with cancer and 1,784,293 without cancer, we documented 10,404 reports of a positive COVID-19 test. Compared to participants without cancer, those living with cancer had 62% increased risk of a positive COVID-19 test (95% CI: 1.37-1.91). Among patients with cancer, current treatment with chemotherapy\/immunotherapy was associated with a nearly 2.5-fold increased risk of a positive test (aOR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.81-3.25). The association between cancer and COVID-19+ was stronger among participants >65 years (aOR: 1.93; 95%CI: 1.51-2.46) compared to younger participants (aOR: 1.32; 95%CI: 1.06-1.64; Pinteraction<0.001); and among males (aOR: 1.71; 95%CI: 1.36-2.15) compared to females (aOR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.14-1.79; Pinteraction=0.02). Conclusions: Individuals with cancer had a significantly increased risk of infection compared to the general community. Those treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy were particularly at-risk of infection.

Design Comparative observational study between nations using publically available data Setting Worldwide Participants Covid-19 patients Interventions Stringency of 11 lockdown policies recorded by the Blavatnik School of Government database and earliness of each policy relative to first recorded national cases Main outcome measures Association with log10 National deaths (LogD) and log10 National cases (LogC) on the 29th April 2020 corrected for predictive demographic variables Results Early introduction was associated with reduced mortality (n=137) and case numbers (n=150) for every policy aside from testing policy, contact tracing and workplace closure. Maximum policy stringency was only found to be associated with reduced mortality (p=0.003) or case numbers (p=0.010) for international travel restrictions. A multivariate model, generated using demographic parameters (r2=0.72 for LogD and r2=0.74 for LogC), was used to assess the timing of each policy. Early introduction of first measure (significance p=0.048, regression coefficient {beta}=-0.004, 95% confidence interval 0 to -0.008), early international travel restrictions (p=0.042, ({beta}=-0.005, -0.001 to -0.009) and early public information (p=0.021, {beta}=-0.005, -0.001 to -0.009) were associated with reduced LogC.

Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may be instrumental in the resolution of and protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we tested 25 hospitalized patients with either microbiologically documented Covid-19 (n=19) or highly suspected of having the disease (n=6) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive- CD69+-expressing interferon-gamma;-producing-(IFN-gamma;) CD8+ T cells by a flow-cytometry for intracelular cytokine staining assay. Two sets of overlapping peptides encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein N-terminal 1-643 amino acid sequence and the entire sequence of SARS-CoV-2 M protein were used simultaneously as antigenic stimulus. Ten patients (40%) had detectable responses, displaying frequencies ranging from 0.15 to 2.7% (median of 0.57 cells\/microlitre; range, 0.43-9.98 cells\/microlitre). The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-gamma; CD8+ T cells in patients admitted to intensive care was comparable (P=0.28) to that in patients hospitalized in other medical wards. No correlation was found between SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-gamma; CD8+ T-cell counts and SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibody levels. Likewise, no correlation was observed between either SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-gamma; CD8+ T cells or S-specific IgG-antibody titers and blood cell count or levels of inflammatory biomarkers. In summary, in this descriptive, preliminary study we showed that SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-gamma; CD8+ T cells can be detected in a non-negligible percentage of patients with moderate to severe forms of Covid-19. Further studies are warranted to determine whether quantitation of these T-cell subsets may provide prognostic information on the clinical course of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Estela Gimenez","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Eliseo Albert","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ignacio Torres","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Remigia","author_inst":"Hematology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Alcaraz","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Galindo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Blasco","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Carlos Solano","author_inst":"Hematology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Val"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Forner","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.

This study aimed at investigating the performance of three high-throughput assays and one rapid lateral flow test relative to the recommended criteria defined by regulatory authorities. Methods: A total of 133 samples, including 100 pre-pandemic samples, 20 samples from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals, and 13 potentially cross-reactive samples were analysed with SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG (DiaSorin) and 2019-nCOV IgG\/IgM Rapid Test (Dynamiker Biotechnology Co). Results: All assays performed with a high level of specificity; however, only Abbott reached 100% (95% CI 96.3-100). The pre-pandemic samples analysed with Roche, DiaSorin and Dynamiker Biotechnology resulted in two to three false-positive results per method (specificity 96.9-98.0%). Sensitivity differed more between the assays, Roche exhibiting the highest sensitivity (100%, CI 83.9-100). The corresponding figures for Abbott, DiaSorin and Dynamiker Biotechnology were 85.0%, 77.8% and 75.0%, respectively. Conclusions: The results of the evaluated SARS-CoV-2 assays vary considerably as well as their ability to fulfil the performance criteria proposed by regulatory authorities. Introduction into clinical use in low-prevalent settings, should therefore, be made with caution.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oskar Ekelund","author_inst":"Region Kronoberg"},{"author_name":"Kim Ekblom","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Vaxjo Central Hospital, Vaxjo, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sofia Somajo","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Blekinge County Hospital, Karlskrona, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johanna Pattison-Granberg","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Vaxjo Central Hospital, Vaxjo, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Karl Olsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Blekinge County Hospital, Karlskrona, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Annika Petersson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Vaxjo Central Hospital, Vaxjo, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Blasco","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Carlos Solano","author_inst":"Hematology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Val"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Forner","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.

In this study focusing on IgG antibodies, we compare reliability of three chemiluminescent (CLIA) and two enzyme linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. Methods: Sera from a total of 271 subjects, including 64 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients were tested for specific Ab using Maglumi (Snibe), Liaison (Diasorin), iFlash (Yhlo), Euroimmun (Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG) and Wantai (Wantai Biological Pharmacy) assays. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were evaluated using manufacturers' and optimized thresholds. Results: Optimized thresholds (Maglumi 2 kAU\/L, Liaison 6.2 kAU\/L and iFlash 15.0 kAU\/L) allowed us to achieve a negative likelihood ratio and an accuracy of: 0.06 and 93.5% for Maglumi; 0.03 and 93.1% for Liaison; 0.03 and 91% for iFlash. Diagnostic sensitivities and specificities were above 93.8% and 85.9%, respectively for all CLIA assays. Overall agreement was 90.3% (Cohen's kappa = 0.805 and SE = 0.041) for CLIA, and 98.4% (Cohen's kappa = 0.962 and SE = 0.126) for ELISA. Conclusions: The results obtained indicate that, for CLIA assays, it might be possible to define thresholds that improve the negative likelihood ratio. Thus, a negative test result enables the identification of subjects at risk of being infected, who should then be closely monitored over time with a view to preventing further viral spread. Redefined thresholds, in addition, improved the overall inter-assay agreement, paving the way to a better harmonization of serologic tests.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Plebani","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Padova, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University  of Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Andrea Padoan","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Padova, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University  of Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Davide Negrini","author_inst":"Department of Medicine-DIMED, University  of Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Benedetta Carpinteri","author_inst":"Department of Medicine-DIMED, University  of Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Laura Sciacovelli","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Padova."},{"author_name":"Annika Petersson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Vaxjo Central Hospital, Vaxjo, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Blasco","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Carlos Solano","author_inst":"Hematology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Val"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Forner","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.

One of the main bottlenecks for COVID-19 detection is reagent and material shortages for sample collection, preservation, and purification prior to testing. Currently, most authorized diagnostic tests require RNA extraction from patient samples and detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RNA purification is expensive, time consuming, and requires technical expertise to perform. Additionally, there have been reported shortages of the RNA purification kits needed for most tests. With these challenges in mind, we report on extraction-free amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly from patient samples. In addition, we have developed a multiplex RT-PCR using the CDC singleplex targets. This multiplex has a limit of detection of 2 copies\/L. We have demonstrated these improvements to the current diagnostic workflow, which reduce complexity and cost, minimize reagent usage, expedite time to results, and increase testing capacity.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha A.

We evaluate potential vaccine research strategies under a range of epidemic conditions determined, in part, by the intensity of public health interventions. Methods: We constructed a compartmental epidemiological model incorporating public health interventions, vaccine efficacy trials and a post-trial population vaccination campaign. The model was used to estimate the duration and benefits of large-scale field trials in comparison with HICS accompanied by an expanded safety trial, and to assess the marginal risk faced by HICS participants. Results: Field trials may demonstrate vaccine efficacy more rapidly than a HICS strategy under epidemic conditions consistent with moderate mitigation policies. A HICS strategy is the only feasible option for testing vaccine efficacy under epidemic suppression, and maximises the benefits of post-trial vaccination. Less successful or absent mitigation results in minimal or no benefit from post-trial vaccination, irrespective of trial design. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 HICS are the optimal method of vaccine testing for populations maintained under epidemic suppression, where vaccination offers the greatest benefits to the local population.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George S Heriot","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Euzebiusz Jamrozik","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Michael J Selgelid","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Crissa Bennett","author_inst":"Global Good\/Intellectual Ventures Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Rafael Rivera","author_inst":"Global Good\/Intellectual Ventures Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Corrie Ortega","author_inst":"Global Good\/Intellectual Ventures Laboratory"},{"author_name":"S.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission in England from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. Results: There were 640 COVID-19 cases (571\/324,306 White, 31\/4,485 Black, 21\/5,732 Asian, 17\/5,803 Other). Compared to the White study members and after adjusting for age and sex, Black individuals had over a 4-fold increased risk of being hospitalised (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: =4.32; 3.00-6.23), and there was a doubling of risk in the Asian group (2.12; 1.37, 3.28) and the Other non-white group (1.84; 1.13, 2.99). After controlling for 15 confounding factors which included neighbourhood deprivation, education, number in household, smoking, markers of body size, inflammation, and glycated haemoglobin, these effect estimates were attenuated by 33% for Blacks, 52% for Asians and 43% for Other, but remained raised for Blacks (2.66; 1.82, 3.91), Asian (1.43; 0.91, 2.26) and other non-white groups (1.41; 0.87, 2.31). Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings show clear ethnic differences in risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 which do not appear to be fully explained by known explanatory factors. If replicated, our results have implications for health policy, including the targeting of prevention advice and vaccination coverage.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Camille Lassale","author_inst":"Hospital del Mar Research Institute IMIM"},{"author_name":"Bamba Gaye","author_inst":"Paris Cardiovascular Research Center-INSERM U970"},{"author_name":"Mark Hamer","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Catharine R Gale","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"G David Batty","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Corrie Ortega","author_inst":"Global Good\/Intellectual Ventures Laboratory"},{"author_name":"S.

In this cross-sectional study, we primarily addressed two key issues. First, we tried to determine whether there is a significant difference in the estimated COVID-19 knowledge level from the online and phone survey methods. Second, we tried to quantify the knowledge and attitude of COVID-19 in Bangladeshi adult population. Data were collected through phone calls (April 14-23, 2020) and online survey (April 18-19, 2020) in Bangladesh. The questionnaire had 20 knowledge questions with each correct response getting one point and incorrect\/do not know response getting no point (maximum total knowledge score 20). Participants scoring >17 were categorized as having good knowledge. The percentages of good knowledge holders were 57.6%, 75.1%, and 95.8% in the phone (n=1426), online non-medical (n=1097), and online medical participants (n=382), respectively. Comparison between phone and online survey showed that, overall, online survey might overestimate knowledge level than that of phone survey, although there was no difference for elderly, poor, and rural people. Male gender, higher education, living in town\/urban areas, good financial condition, and use of internet were positively associated with good knowledge. However, higher knowledge was associated with having less confidence in the final control of COVID-19. Our adult population-level estimates showed that only 32.6% (95% CI 30.1-35.2%) had good knowledge. This study provides crucial information that could be useful for the researchers and policymakers to develop effective strategies.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anwarul Karim","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Mastura Akter","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"AHM Thafikul Mazid","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Orindom Shing Pulock","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tasmiah Tahera Aziz","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Samira Hayee","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nowrin Tamanna","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"GS Chuwdhury","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Afsana Haque","author_inst":"Department of Urban Planning and Design, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Farhana Yeasmin","author_inst":"Department of Applied Food Science and Nutrition, Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mashkura Akter Mitu","author_inst":"Faculty of Agriculture, Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University, Dinajpur, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Farjana Yeasmin","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Government Hazi Mohammad Mohsin College, National University, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Humayun Rashid","author_inst":"Chattogram International Medical College, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Ashish Kumar Kuri","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Arni Das","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Koushik Majumder","author_inst":"Chittagong Medical College and Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Dipen Barua","author_inst":"Centre of Buddhist Studies, Faculty of Arts, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Md Mahabubur Rahaman","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Division, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Sanjida Akter","author_inst":"Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University Malaya, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nashid Niaz Munia","author_inst":"Chattogram International Medical College, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Jabin Sultana","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chattogram, Bangl"},{"author_name":"Faeeqa Usaila","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Sifat","author_inst":"Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nishat Anjum Nourin","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md Forhad Uddin","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mrinmoy Bhowmik","author_inst":"Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tanvir Ahammed","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sharik","author_inst":"Upzila Health and Family Planning Office, Sadar, Gopalganj, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Quddus Mehnaz","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Md Nur Hossain Bhuiyan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Chittagong Medical College and Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tahmina Banu","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pratt","author_inst":"Quality Use of Medicines and Pharmacy Research Centre, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gowtham Rao","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Christian G.

Objectives: To describe the dynamics and determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in HCW. Design: Prospective observational study conducted from February 24th until April 10th, 2020. Setting: Comparison of a 1,500-bed adult and a 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. Participants: All symptomatic HCW screened for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab. Measurements: HCW screened positive were prospectively questioned on their profession, symptoms, occupational and non-occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Results: Among 1344 symptomatic HCW tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no death were reported. Most HCW (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on March 23rd, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment (PPE) for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric setting, respectively (p=0.0022). In the adult setting, HCW more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% versus 15%, p=0.046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period. Limitations: Lack of COVID-19 negative controls and recall bias. Conclusion: Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients' care allowed protection of HCW and containment of the outbreak. Residual transmissions were related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrien CONTEJEAN","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jeremie LEPORRIER","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Etienne CANOUI","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Fanny ALBY-LAURENT","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel LAFONT","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Lauren BEAUDEAU","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Perrine PARIZE","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Fabienne LECIEUX","author_inst":"Service de sante au travail, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Agnes GREFFET","author_inst":"Service de sante au travail, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Gerard CHERON","author_inst":"Service d'urgences pediatriques, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Remy GAUZIT","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques FOURGEAUD","author_inst":"Laboratoire de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie L'HONNEUR","author_inst":"Departement de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc TRELUYER","author_inst":"Departement de soins intensifs pediatriques, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Caroline CHARLIER","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anne CASETTA","author_inst":"Equipe operationnelle d'hygiene hospitaliere, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre FRANGE","author_inst":"Laboratoire de microbiologie clinique, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Marianne LERUEZ-VILLE","author_inst":"Laboratoire de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Flore ROZENBERG","author_inst":"Departement de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Olivier LORTHOLARY","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Solen KERNEIS","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Faeeqa Usaila","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Sifat","author_inst":"Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nishat Anjum Nourin","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md Forhad Uddin","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mrinmoy Bhowmik","author_inst":"Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tanvir Ahammed","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sharik","author_inst":"Upzila Health and Family Planning Office, Sadar, Gopalganj, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Quddus Mehnaz","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Md Nur Hossain Bhuiyan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Chittagong Medical College and Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tahmina Banu","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pratt","author_inst":"Quality Use of Medicines and Pharmacy Research Centre, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gowtham Rao","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Christian G.

Our aim is to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa against the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points. Methods: We used two scenarios to approximate the child deaths that may be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. First, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcal, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever (DTP3, HepB3, Hib3, PCV3, RotaC, MCV1, MCV2, MenA, RCV, YFV) to approximate the future deaths averted before completing five years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month COVID-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. Second, we analysed an alternative scenario that approximates the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 risk period. The excess number of infections due to additional SARS-CoV-2 exposure during immunisation visits assumes that contact reducing interventions flatten the outbreak curve during the COVID-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport and that upon child infection the whole household would be infected. Country specific household age structure estimates and age dependent infection fatality rates are then applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit-risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation alongside 95% uncertainty range estimates from probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Findings: For every one excess COVID-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, there could be 84 (14-267) deaths in children prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefit-risk ratio for the vaccinated children, siblings, parents or adult care-givers, and older adults in the households of vaccinated children are 85,000 (4,900 - 546,000), 75,000 (4,400 - 483,000), 769 (148 - 2,700), and 96 (14 - 307) respectively. In the alternative scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefit-risk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 3 (0 - 10) under these highly conservative assumptions and if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefit-risk ratio is 3,000 (182 - 21,000). Interpretation: Our analysis suggests that the health benefits of deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa far outweighs the excess risk of COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits, especially for the vaccinated children. However, there are other factors that must be considered for strategic decision making to sustain routine childhood immunisation in African countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include logistical constraints of vaccine supply chain problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, reallocation of immunisation providers to other prioritised health services, healthcare staff shortages caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections among the staff, decreased demand for vaccination arising from community reluctance to visit vaccination clinics for fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infections, and infection risk to healthcare staff providing immunisation services as well as to their households and onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission into the wider community.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaja Abbas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Simon R Procter","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Clark","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Funk","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM CMMID Covid-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Tewodaj Mengistu","author_inst":"Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance"},{"author_name":"Dan Hogan","author_inst":"Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance"},{"author_name":"Emily Dansereau","author_inst":"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jacques FOURGEAUD","author_inst":"Laboratoire de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie L'HONNEUR","author_inst":"Departement de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc TRELUYER","author_inst":"Departement de soins intensifs pediatriques, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Caroline CHARLIER","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anne CASETTA","author_inst":"Equipe operationnelle d'hygiene hospitaliere, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre FRANGE","author_inst":"Laboratoire de microbiologie clinique, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Marianne LERUEZ-VILLE","author_inst":"Laboratoire de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Flore ROZENBERG","author_inst":"Departement de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Olivier LORTHOLARY","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Solen KERNEIS","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Faeeqa Usaila","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Sifat","author_inst":"Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nishat Anjum Nourin","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md Forhad Uddin","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mrinmoy Bhowmik","author_inst":"Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tanvir Ahammed","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sharik","author_inst":"Upzila Health and Family Planning Office, Sadar, Gopalganj, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Quddus Mehnaz","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Md Nur Hossain Bhuiyan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Chittagong Medical College and Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tahmina Banu","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pratt","author_inst":"Quality Use of Medicines and Pharmacy Research Centre, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gowtham Rao","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Christian G.
