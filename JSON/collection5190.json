Without efficacious antiviral drugs or vaccines available, mass quarantine has been the main strategy adopted by governments to contain the virus spread. This has led to a significant reduction in the number of infected people and deaths and to a diminished pressure over the health care system. However, an economic depression is following due to the forced absence of worker from their job and to the closure of many productive activities. For these reasons, governments are lessening progressively the mass quarantine measures to avoid an economic catastrophe. However, most people has not been yet exposed to the virus, so are susceptible to Covid-19. Therefore, the reopening of firms and commercial activities might lead to a resurgence of infection, as already reported in South Korea and in China were epidemic was considered almost gone although in a few of cases. In the worst-case scenario, this might impose the return to strict lockdown measures. Epidemiological models are therefore necessary to forecast possible new infection outbreaks and to inform government to promptly adopt new containment measures. In this context, we tested here if technical analysis methods commonly used in the financial market might provide early signal of change in the direction of SARS-Cov-2 infection trend in Italy, Iran and Brazil, three countries which have been strongly hit by the pandemic but whose present infection trends are substantially different from each other being therefore particularly useful to understand the potential of TA models. We conclude that technical analysis indicators can be usefully adopted to this aim.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marino Paroli","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Maria Isabella Sirinian","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20102178","rel_title":"Feasibility of Reusing Surgical Mask Under Different Disinfection Treatments","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20102178","rel_abs":"The possibility to extend the lifespan or even reuse one-off personal protective equipment, especially for N95 respirator and surgical mask become critical during pandemic.

In total, 2175 respondents completed the questionnaire (age range: 18-69 years). The mean adherence scores for personal and community preventive measures were 7.23 {+\/-} 1.63 (range 1-9) and 9.57 {+\/-} 1.12 (range 1-11), respectively. Perceived adaptation of the community to lockdown ({beta}=2.64, 95% CI 1.25 -4.03), fears\/worries concerning one's health ({beta}=2.87, 95% CI 0.04-5.70), residing in large cities ({beta}=19.40, 95% CI 13.78-25.03), access to official COVID19 information sources ({beta}=16.45, 95% CI 6.82-26.08), and belonging to the healthcare sector ({beta}=22.53, 95% CI 16.00-29.07) were associated with a higher adherence score to anti -COVID instructions.

Particles of oral\/nasal fluid released by patients undergoing NHF therapy may pose a cross-infection risk, which is a potential concern for treating COVID-19 patients. Methods Liquid particles within the exhaled breath of healthy participants were measured with two protocols: (1) high speed camera imaging and counting exhaled particles under high magnification (6 participants) and (2) measuring the deposition of a chemical marker (riboflavin-5-monophosphate) at a distance of 100 and 500 mm on filter papers through which air was drawn (10 participants). The filter papers were assayed with HPLC. Breathing conditions tested included quiet (resting) breathing and vigorous breathing (which here means nasal snorting, voluntary coughing and voluntary sneezing). Unsupported (natural) breathing and NHF at 30 and 60 LPM were compared. Results (1) Imaging: During quiet breathing, no particles were recorded with unsupported breathing or 30 LPM NHF (detection limit for single particles 33 microns). Particles were detected in 2 of 6 participants at 60 LPM quiet breathing at approximately 10% of the rate caused by unsupported vigorous breathing. Unsupported vigorous breathing released the greatest numbers of particles. Vigorous breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, released half the number of particles compared to vigorous breathing without NHF. (2) Chemical marker tests: No oral\/nasal fluid was detected in quiet breathing without NHF (detection limit 0.28 microlitres\/m3). In quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, small quantities were detected in 4 out of 29 quiet breathing tests, not exceeding 17 microlitres\/m3. Vigorous breathing released 200-1000 times more fluid than the quiet breathing with NHF. The quantities detected in vigorous breathing were similar whether using NHF or not. Conclusion During quiet breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy may cause oral\/nasal fluid to be released as particles, at levels of tens of microlitres per cubic metre of air. Vigorous breathing (snort, cough or sneeze) releases 200 to 1000 times more oral\/nasal fluid than quiet breathing. During vigorous breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy caused no statistically significant difference in the quantity of oral\/nasal fluid released compares to unsupported breathing. NHF use does not increase the risk of dispersing infectious aerosols above the risk of unsupported vigorous breathing. Standard infection prevention and control measures should apply when dealing with a patient who has an acute respiratory infection, independent of which, if any, respiratory support is being used.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark C Jermy","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Callum JT Spence","author_inst":"Fisher and Paykel Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Robert Kirton","author_inst":"Fisher and Paykel Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Jane F O'Donnell","author_inst":"Fisher and Paykel Healthcare; School of Nursing, Massey University"},{"author_name":"Natalia Kabaliuk","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Sally Gaw","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Yannan Jiang","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Zulkhairi Zainol Abidin","author_inst":"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Ronald L Dougherty","author_inst":"University of Kansas"},{"author_name":"Philip Rowe","author_inst":"Fisher and Paykel Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Anjula Mahaliyana","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Amelia Gibbs","author_inst":"Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Sally Roberts","author_inst":"Auckland District Health Board"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20097410","rel_title":"COVID-19 death rates by age and sex and the resulting mortality vulnerability of countries and regions in the world","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20097410","rel_abs":"The growing number of series on COVID-19 deaths classified by age and sex, released by national health authorities, has allowed us to compute age and sex patterns of its mortality, based on 183,619 deaths from Western Europe and the USA.

Norway closed all kindergartens, schools and universities, and banned sports and cultural activities, while Sweden kept most institutions and trainings facilities open. We aimed to compare peoples' attitudes towards authorities and control measures, and effects on life in Norway and Sweden. Design: Anonymous web-based surveys for individuals age 15 or older distributed through Facebook using the snowball method. Setting: Norway and Sweden, mid-March to mid-April, 2020. Participants: Altogether, 3,508 individuals participated in the survey; 3000 in Norway and 508 in Sweden. 79% of the participants were women, 60% of the Norwegians and 47% of the Swedes were between 30-49 years, and around 45% of the participants in both countries had more than 4 years of higher education. Outcome measures: Perceived threat of the pandemic, views on infection control measures, and impact on daily life. We performed descriptive analyses of the responses and compared the two countries. Results: People had high trust in the health services in both countries, but differed in the degree of trust in their government (17% had high trust in Norway and 37% in Sweden). More Norwegians than Swedes agreed that school closure was a good measure (66% Norway and 18% in Sweden), and that countries with open schools were irresponsible (65% in Norway and 23% in Sweden). About the same amount responded that COVID-19 was a large to very large threat to the population (53% in Norway and 58% in Sweden), whereas more Norwegians than Swedes responded that the threat from repercussions of the mitigation measures were large or very large (71% in Norway and 56% in Sweden). Compliance with infection preventive measures was high and similar in the two countries (more than 98%). In Norway, 69% lived a more sedentary life during the pandemic versus 50% in Sweden; and Norwegians reported they ate more than Swedes (44% in Norway and 33% in Sweden). Conclusion: Sweden, with less restrictive measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, had a higher level of trust in the authorities, while Norwegians reported a more negative lifestyle during the pandemic. The level of trust in the health care system and self-reported compliance with preventive measures was high in both countries.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lise M.

We sought to identify whether implementation of the nationwide lockdown (shelter-in-place) order in South Africa affected ambulatory clinic visitation in rural Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN). Design Prospective, longitudinal cohort study Setting Data were analyzed from the Africa Health Research Institute Health and Demographic Surveillance System, which includes prospective data capture of clinic visits at eleven primary healthcare clinics in northern KwaZulu-Natal Participants A total of 36,291 individuals made 55,545 clinic visits during the observation period. Exposure of Interest We conducted an interrupted time series analysis with regression discontinuity methods to estimate changes in outpatient clinic visitation from 60 days before through 35 days after the lockdown period. Outcome Measures Daily clinic visitation at ambulatory clinics. In stratified analyses we assessed visitation for the following sub-categories: child health, perinatal care and family planning, HIV services, non-communicable diseases, and by age and sex strata. Results We found no change in total clinic visits\/clinic\/day from prior to and during the lockdown (-6.9 visits\/clinic\/day, 95%CI -17.4, 3.7) or trends in clinic visitation over time during the lockdown period (-0.2, 95%CI -3.4, 3.1). We did detect a reduction in child healthcare visits at the lockdown (-7.2 visits\/clinic\/day, 95%CI -9.2, -5.3), which was seen in both children <1 and children 1-5. In contrast, we found a significant increase in HIV visits immediately after the lockdown (8.4 visits\/clinic\/day, 95%CI 2.4, 14.4). No other differences in clinic visitation were found for perinatal care and family planning, non-communicable diseases, or among adult men and women. Conclusions In rural KZN, the ambulatory healthcare system was largely resilient during the national-wide lockdown order. A major exception was child healthcare visitation, which declined immediately after the lockdown but began to normalize in the weeks thereafter. Future work should explore efforts to decentralize chronic care for high-risk populations and whether catch-up vaccination programs might be required in the wake of these findings.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark J Siedner","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"John D.

Here, we combine existing data on SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and RNA kinetics using a formal quantitative approach that enables integration of 3,214 data points from 516 individuals, published in 22 studies. This allows us to determine the mean values and distributions of IgG and IgM seroconversion times and titer kinetics, and to characterize how antibody and RNA detection probabilities change during the early phase of infection. We observe extensive variation in antibody response patterns and RNA detection patterns, explained by both individual heterogeneity and protocol differences such as targeted antigen and sample type.

This study estimates the economic burden of COVID-19 in 31 provincial-level administrative regions in China between January and March 2020. Methods The healthcare and societal cost of COVID-19 was estimated using bottom-up approach. The main cost components included identification, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, compulsory quarantine and productivity losses for all affected residents in China during the study period. Input data were obtained from government reports, clinical guidelines, and other published literature. The primary outcomes were total health and societal costs. Costs were reported in both RMB and USD (2019 value). Outcomes The total estimated healthcare and societal cost associated with the outbreak is 4.26 billion RMB (0.62 billion USD) and 2,647 billion RMB (383 billion USD), respectively. The main components of routine healthcare costs are inpatient care (41.0%) and medicines (30.9%). The main component of societal costs is productivity losses (99.8%). Hubei province incurred the highest healthcare cost (83.2%) whilst Guangdong province incurred the highest societal cost (14.6%).

Predictive epidemiological modeling indicates that chances for resurgence are high. However, parametrization of the epidemiological nature of COVID-19 and the effect of relaxing social distancing is not well constrained, resulting in highly uncertain outcomes in view of managing future intensive care unit (ICU) needs. Methods and findings: For performance analysis of exit strategies we developed an open-source ensemble-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model. It takes into account uncertainties for the COVID-19 parametrization and social distancing measures. The model is calibrated to data of the outbreak and lockdown phase. For the exit phase, the model includes the capability to activate an emergency brake, reinstating lockdown conditions. Alternatively, the model uses an adaptive COVID-19 cruise control (ACCC) capable to retain a targeted ICU level. The model is demonstrated for the Netherlands and we analyzed progressive and adaptive exit strategies through a stress test of managing ICU rates. The progressive strategy reflects the outcome of social and economic pressure to use one-way steering toward progressively relaxing measures at an early stage. It is marked by a high probability for the activation of the emergency brake due to an unsolicited growth of ICU needs in the following months. Alternatively, the two-way steering ACCC can flatten ICU needs in a more gradual way and avoids activation of the emergency brake. It also performs well for seasonal variation in the reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. Conclusions: The adaptive strategy (ACCC) is favored, as it avoids the use of the emergency brake at the expense of small steps of restrictive measures and allows the exploration of riskier and potentially rewarding measures in the future pathways of the exit strategy.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan-Diederik van Wees","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Martijn van der Kuip","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Sander Osinga","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"David van Westerloo","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Michael Tanck","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, A"},{"author_name":"Maurice Hanegraaf","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Maarten Pluymaekers","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Olwijn Leeuwenburgh","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lonneke van Bijsterveldt","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pien Verreijdt","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, VUmc School of Medical Sciences, VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Logan Brunner","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marceline Tutu van Furth","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20102434","rel_title":"Changing trends of excess self-protective behavior, and association with belief in prevention myths during the COVID-19 epidemic in China: A panel study","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20102434","rel_abs":"Abstract Objective This prospective observational study examined changing trends of excess self-protective behavior (EPB), and its association with perceived risk, severity and belief in prevention myths during the Chinese COVID-19 epidemic. Methods The study employed a longitudinal design. Participants were recruited for an online panel survey from chat groups on social media platforms. Descriptive statistics and the CATMOD program were used for data analysis. Findings Participants numbered 150 for the linkable baseline survey and 102 for the final survey. There were 5 waves of interviews. The prevalence of participants perceiving a personal risk of contracting COVID-19, and severe consequences of the disease, was 18.6% and 25.5%, respectively. Their prevalence had declined to 4.9% and 17.6%, respectively, by the last observation point. The 5 selected EPBs also manifested a decreasing trend. Belief in COVID-19 prevention myths trended upwards. Perceived risk was positively associated with each EPB, and perceived severity with disinfection of clothes and hoarding of products. Myth adherence was positively associated with disinfection of clothes and both hand washing and sanitization. Conclusion This study yielded new information about EPB among the public during the COVID-19 epidemic. Policy and health education modifications are essential for minimizing the adverse health effects of subscribing to prevention myths.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaozhao Yousef Yang","author_inst":"School of Sociology and Anthropology, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Sihui peng","author_inst":"Center for Tobacco Control Research, Zhejiang University, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tingzhong Yang","author_inst":"Zhejiang university"},{"author_name":"Ian R.H.

Setting: Between 14 and 24 April 2020 we tested 161 staff at four locations: our cancer centres in Reading - Berkshire, Newport - S Wales, Liverpool - Merseyside, and Bedlington in Northumberland. Participants: Testing was available to all staff who were on site at the four locations named above at the time the study was carried out. 161 staff (80 men, 81 women) gave voluntary consent to have the tests and all testing gave rise to valid results. Interventions: We used the South Korean test for antibodies to SARS CoV-2: Sugentech SGTi-flex COVID-19 IgM\/IgG1. For each test, blood was collected and added to the sample well of the test cassette and buffer solution added. The test result was legible after 15 minutes. Outcome measures: The number of tests positive for the presence of antibodies was the primary outcome measure. The ratio of tests positive for the presence of IgM antibodies versus IgG antibodies was the secondary outcome measure. Results: Between 14 and 24 April 2020, 161 staff (age m = 43) were tested at four Rutherford Cancer Care centres that offer proton beam therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Out of 161, 12 samples (7.50%) tested positive of which 7 samples (4.35%) detected IgM only, 2 samples (1.24%) detected IgG only and 3 samples (1.86%) detected both IgM and IgG. Conclusions: The low seroconversion rate in the sample population limits the current utility of the test as a way of reducing risk to vulnerable patient populations but longitudinal retesting will provide further data.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karol Sikora","author_inst":"Rutherford Health"},{"author_name":"Ian Barwick","author_inst":"Rutherford Health"},{"author_name":"Ceri Hamilton","author_inst":"Rutherford Health"},{"author_name":"Amit Raodeo","author_inst":"Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Tanck","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, A"},{"author_name":"Maurice Hanegraaf","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Maarten Pluymaekers","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Olwijn Leeuwenburgh","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lonneke van Bijsterveldt","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pien Verreijdt","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, VUmc School of Medical Sciences, VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Logan Brunner","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marceline Tutu van Furth","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20082073","rel_title":"Early assessment of knowledge, attitudes, anxiety and behavioral adaptations of Connecticut residents to COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20082073","rel_abs":"Objectives.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among non-healthcare-related participants after a stringent stay-at-home directive was implemented. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with anxiety, perceived seriousness of COVID-19 and loneliness. Results. A total of 464 participants responded to the survey. Most participants recognized cough, shortness of breath and fever as primary symptoms of COVID-19. Nearly 50% reported high levels of anxiety to COVID-19 and 48% reported being loneliness during the social isolation. Those with higher level of COVID-19 knowledge had 1.20 times higher levels with anxiety. Being married had 1.79 times higher levels of anxiety about COVID-19. Older age was associated with loneliness during the social isolation. Older age was also associated with taking the pandemic seriously. Females were less likely to report loneliness than males. Conclusions. It is crucial for the public health authorities not only provide accurate and scientific information about the COVID-19 promoting protective behavior changes but also to minimize anxiety through supportive messages and recommendations for positive coping strategies and timely offering of counseling services for those in need.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Toan Ha","author_inst":"UConn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen Schensul","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Sciences University of Connecticut School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Judy Lewis","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Sciences University of Connecticut School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stacey Brown","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Sciences University of Connecticut School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Tanck","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, A"},{"author_name":"Maurice Hanegraaf","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Maarten Pluymaekers","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Olwijn Leeuwenburgh","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lonneke van Bijsterveldt","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pien Verreijdt","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, VUmc School of Medical Sciences, VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Logan Brunner","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marceline Tutu van Furth","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20082123","rel_title":"Feasibility of non-invasive nitric oxide inhalation in acute hypoxic respiratory failure: potential role during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20082123","rel_abs":"Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF) is characterized by both lower arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions in the blood.

Invasive mechancial ventilation (IMV) is usually reserved for patients who are unable to maintain their airway, those with worsening hypoxemia, or those who develop respiratory muscle fatigue and consequent hypercapnia. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) gas is known to improve oxygenation in patients with ARF by manipulating ventilation-perfusion matching. Addition of iNO may potentially alleviate the need for IMV in selected patients. This article demonstrates the feasibility of this technique based on our experience of patients with hypoxemic ARF.

Patients admitted to a pediatric hospital with worsening respiratory symptoms were tested using a multiplex PCR assay from nasopharyngeal swabs. The additive seasonal effects of outdoor temperatures and indoor relative humidity (RH) were evaluated. The 8-year average peak activity of human coronaviruses occurred in the first week of January, when droplet and contact transmission was enabled by the low indoor RH of 20-30%. Previous studies have shown that an increase in RH to 50% has been associated with markedly reduced viability and transmission of influenza virus and animal coronaviruses. As disease incidence was reduced by 50% in early March, to 75% in early April, to greater than 99% at the end of April, a relationship was observed from colder temperatures in January with a low indoor RH to a gradual increase in outdoor temperatures in April with an indoor RH of 45-50%. As a lipid-bound, enveloped virus with similar size characteristics to endemic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 should be subject to the same dynamics of reduced viability and transmission with increased humidity. In addition to the major role of social distancing, the transition from lower to higher indoor RH with increasing outdoor temperatures could have an additive effect on the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 cases in May. Over the 8-year period of this study, human coronavirus activity was either zero or >99% reduction in the months of June through September, and the implication would be that SARS-Cov-2 may follow a similar pattern.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alan T Evangelista","author_inst":"St. Christopher's Hospital for Children"},{"author_name":"Sneha Varkey","author_inst":"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"George Cornmell","author_inst":"Adult Intensive Care Services, the Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Leanne Parsons","author_inst":"Adult Intensive Care Services, the Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Maneesha Tol","author_inst":"Adult Intensive Care Services, the Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Matthew Siuba","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Respiratory Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA"},{"author_name":"Mahesh Ramanan","author_inst":"1Adult Intensive Care Services, the Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Olwijn Leeuwenburgh","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lonneke van Bijsterveldt","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pien Verreijdt","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, VUmc School of Medical Sciences, VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Logan Brunner","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marceline Tutu van Furth","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20103317","rel_title":"An Age and Space Structured SIR Model Describing the Covid-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20103317","rel_abs":"We present an epidemic model capable of describing key features of the present Covid-19 pandemic.

Approach: We fit a spatiotemporal Negative Binomial generalised linear model to Public Health England SARS-CoV-2 testing data at the Lower Tier Local Authority region level. We assume an order-1 autoregressive model for case progression within regions, coupling discrete spatial units via observed commuting data and time-varying measures of traffic flow. We fit the model via maximum likelihood estimation in order to calculate region-specific risk of ongoing transmission, as well as measuring regional uncertainty in incidence. Results: We detect marked heterogeneity across England in COVID-19 incidence, not only in raw estimated incidence, but in the characteristics of within-region and between-region dynamics of PHE testing data. There is evidence for a spatially diverse set of regions having a higher daily increase of cases than others, having accounted for current case numbers, population size, and human mobility. Uncertainty in model estimates is generally greater in rural regions. Conclusions: A wide range of spatial heterogeneity in COVID-19 epidemic distribution and infection rate exists in England currently. Future work should incorporate fine-scaled demographic and health covariates, with continued improvement in spatially-detailed case reporting data. The method described here may be used to measure heterogeneity in real-time as behavioural and social interventions are relaxed, serving to identify \"hotspots\" of resurgent cases occurring in diverse areas of the country, and triggering locally-intensive surveillance and interventions as needed. Caveats: There is general concern over the ability of PHE testing data to capture the true prevalence of infection within the population, though this approach is designed to provide measures of spatial prevalence based on testing that can be used to guide further future testing effort. Now-casts of epidemic characteristics are presented based on testing data alone (as opposed to \"true\" prevalence in any one area). The model used in this analysis is phenomenological for ease and speed of principled parameter inference; we choose the model which best fits the current spatial case timeseries, without attempting to enforce \"SIR\"-type epidemic dynamics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio Fronterre","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M Read","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Barry Rowlingson","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Jessica Bridgen","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Simon Alderton","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Peter J Diggle","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Chris P Jewell","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Olwijn Leeuwenburgh","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lonneke van Bijsterveldt","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pien Verreijdt","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, VUmc School of Medical Sciences, VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Logan Brunner","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marceline Tutu van Furth","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20101501","rel_title":"The impact of physical distancing measures against COVID-19 transmission on contacts and mixing patterns in the Netherlands: repeated cross-sectional surveys","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20101501","rel_abs":"Background During the current pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) many countries have taken drastic measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV2. The measures often include physical distancing that aims to reduce the number of contacts in the population. Little is known about the actual reduction in number of contacts as a consequence of physical distancing measures. Methods In the Netherlands, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2016\/2017 in which 8179 participants retrospectively reported the number, age and gender of different persons they had contacted (spoken to in person or touched) during the previous day. The survey was repeated among 2830 of the original participants, using the same questionnaire, in March and April 2020 after physical distancing measures had been implemented. Results The average number of contacts in the community was reduced from on average 12.5 (interquartile range: 2-17) to 3.7 (interquartile range: 0-4) different persons per participant, a reduction of 71% (95% confidence interval: 71-71). The reduction in the number of community contacts was highest for children and adolescents (between 5 and 20 years) and smallest for elderly persons of 80 years and older. The reduction in the effective number of total contacts, measured as the largest eigenvalue of the matrix with community and household contacts, was 62% (95% confidence interval: 48 - 72). Conclusion The substantial reduction in contacts has contributed greatly in halting the COVID-19 epidemic. This reduction was unevenly distributed over age groups, household sizes and occupations. These findings offer guidance for the lifting of age-group targeted measures.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jantien A.

The SIR model has the combination of three ordinary differential equations. In this study, we have used the data of COVID-2019 Outbreak of India on 8 May, 2020. In this data, we have used 135710 susceptible cases, 54340 infectious cases and 1830 reward\/removed cases for the initial level of experimental purpose. Data about a wide variety of infectious diseases has been analyzed with the help of SIR model. Therefore, this model has been already well tested for infectious diseases by various scientists and researchers. Using the data to the number of COVID-2019 outbreak cases in India the results obtained from the analysis and simulation of this proposed SIR model showing that the COVID-2019 epidemic cases increase for some time and there after this outbreak decrease. The results obtained from the SIR model also suggest that the Euler method can be used to predict transmission and prevent the COVID-2019 epidemic in India. Finally, from this study, we have found that the outbreak of COVID-2019 epidemic in India will be at its peak on 25 May 2020 and after that it will work slowly and on the verge of ending in the first or second week of August 2020.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dr. Ramjeet Singh Yadav","author_inst":"Ashoka Institute of Technology and Management, Varanasi, UP, India"},{"author_name":"Liesbeth Mollema","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment"},{"author_name":"Don Klinkenberg","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment"},{"author_name":"Fiona R.M. van der Klis","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment"},{"author_name":"Hester E. de Melker","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment"},{"author_name":"Susan van den Hof","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment"},{"author_name":"Jacco Wallinga","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment"},{"author_name":"Olwijn Leeuwenburgh","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lonneke van Bijsterveldt","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pien Verreijdt","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, VUmc School of Medical Sciences, VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Logan Brunner","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marceline Tutu van Furth","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20101840","rel_title":"Depression and loneliness during COVID-19 restrictions in the United States, and their associations with frequency of social and sexual connections","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20101840","rel_abs":"Purpose: To estimate the prevalence of depression and loneliness during the US COVID-19 response, and examine their associations with frequency of social and sexual connections. Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of American adults (n=1010), aged 18-94, running from April 10-20, 2020. We assessed depressive symptoms (CES-D-10 scale), loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), and frequency of in-person and remote social connections (4 items, e.g. hugging family member, video chats) and sexual connections (4 items, e.g. partnered sexual activity, dating app use). Results: One-third of participants (32%) reported depressive symptoms, and loneliness was high [mean (SD): 4.4 (1.7)]. Those with depressive symptoms were more likely to be women, age 20-29, unmarried, and low-income. Frequent in-person connections were associated with lower depression and loneliness; frequent remote connections were not. Conclusions: Depression and loneliness were elevated during the early US COVID-19 response. Those who maintained frequent in-person, but not remote, social and sexual connections had better mental health outcomes. While COVID-19 social restrictions remain necessary, it will be critical to expand mental health services to serve those most at-risk and identify effective ways of maintaining social and sexual connections from a distance.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Molly Rosenberg","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington"},{"author_name":"Maya Luetke","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington"},{"author_name":"Devon Hensel","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sina Kianersi","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington"},{"author_name":"Debby Herbenick","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington"},{"author_name":"Susan van den Hof","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment"},{"author_name":"Jacco Wallinga","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment"},{"author_name":"Olwijn Leeuwenburgh","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lonneke van Bijsterveldt","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pien Verreijdt","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, VUmc School of Medical Sciences, VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Logan Brunner","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marceline Tutu van Furth","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20103010","rel_title":"Social heterogeneity and the COVID-19 lockdown in a multi-group SEIR model","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20103010","rel_abs":"The goal of the lockdown is to mitigate and if possible prevent the spread of an epidemic. It consists in reducing social interactions. This is taken into account by the introduction of a factor of reduction of social interactions q, and by decreasing the transmission coefficient of the disease accordingly. Evaluating q is a difficult question and one can ask if it makes sense to compute an average coefficient q for a given population, in order to make predictions on the basic reproduction rate R0, the dynamics of the epidemic or the fraction of the population that will have been infected by the end of the epidemic. On a very simple example, we show that the computation of R0 in a heterogeneous population is not reduced to the computation of an average q but rather to the direct computation of an average coefficient R0. Even more interesting is the fact that, in a range of data compatible with the Covid-19 outbreak, the size of the epidemic is deeply modified by social heterogeneity, as is the height of the epidemic peak, while the date at which it is reached mainly depends on the average R0 coefficient.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean Dolbeault","author_inst":"Universite Paris Dauphine - PSL"},{"author_name":"Gabriel TURINICI","author_inst":"Universite Paris Dauphine - PSL"},{"author_name":"Devon Hensel","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sina Kianersi","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington"},{"author_name":"Debby Herbenick","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington"},{"author_name":"Susan van den Hof","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment"},{"author_name":"Jacco Wallinga","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment"},{"author_name":"Olwijn Leeuwenburgh","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lonneke van Bijsterveldt","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pien Verreijdt","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, VUmc School of Medical Sciences, VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Logan Brunner","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marceline Tutu van Furth","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20102954","rel_title":"A Human-Pathogen SEIR-P Model for COVID-19 Outbreak under different intervention scenarios in Kenya","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20102954","rel_abs":"This work describes the mathematical modelling and dynamics of a novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Kenya.

Aim: Since apparent differences were noted in the disease transmission between the two South East Asian countries of India and Thailand, the study aims to draw comparative account of the progression of COVID 19 in near future between these two countries. Methods: The study used data of COVID 19 confirmed cases in India and Thailand from WHO COVID 19 situation reports during the time period between 25th March, 2020 and 14th May, 2020. After determination of stationarity in the data and differencing, observation of autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) (2,2,1) model was used to forecast the COVID 19 confirmed cases in both these countries for two weeks (i.e. 28th May, 2020). IBM SPSS version 20.0 software was used for data analysis. Results: The study demonstrated a possible increasing trend in number of COVID 19 cases in India in the coming two weeks with an estimated point forecast of 1,28,772 (95% CI 115023 to 142520) by 28th May, 2020. A stationary phase was forecasted for Thailand with a difference of only 43 cases between 14th May (the last case of input data) and 28th May. Conclusion: The time series forecasting employed in the present study warrants thorough preparation on part of the Indian health care system and authorities and calls for caution with regard to decisions made on lifting the control measures. The difference in the time series forecasting between these two South East Asian countries also highlights the need for strengthening of public health systems.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Viswa Chaitanya Chandu","author_inst":"SIBAR Institute of Dental Sciences"},{"author_name":"D.

Whilst the decisions in essentially every country on Earth, were taken with the same aim: to limit population movements and social life, two aggravating factors of the spread of the virus, only the environmental nudges effectively helped slow the virus growth scale. The authors explain the rationale behind these results and suggest that people seek information beyond governmental websites that they generally mistrust. They further suggest using Scientists as role models to encourage governmental website's traffic and designing recursive nudges to increase the impact of individual and social interventions.

Public health policies need to address behavioural change of the population on a global scale in a more targeted manner and it is hoped that this paper will provide some insight on how to do so.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paola Cecchi-Dimeglio","author_inst":"Harvard University, Law School & Kennedy School"},{"author_name":"Raphaela Kitson-Pantano","author_inst":"Absolutys"},{"author_name":"David Luu","author_inst":"Absolutys"},{"author_name":"Yann Cabon","author_inst":"People Culture Drive Consulting Group"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Jin","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Li","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Zhou","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hubei Provincial Hospital of TCM, Hubei Institute of Traditional Medicine, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Hang Chang","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lonneke van Bijsterveldt","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pien Verreijdt","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, VUmc School of Medical Sciences, VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Logan Brunner","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marceline Tutu van Furth","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20103051","rel_title":"Data-driven analysis on the simulations of the spread of COVID-19 under different interventions of China","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20103051","rel_abs":"Since February 2020, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to more than 200 countries in the world. During the pandemic, local governments in China have implemented different interventions to efficiently control the spread of the epidemic. Characterizing transmission of COVID-19 under some typical interventions is essential to help countries develop appropriate interventions. Based on the pre-symptomatic transmission patterns of COVID-19, we established a novel compartmental model: Baysian SIHR model with latent Markov structure, which treated the numbers of infected and infectious individuals without isolation to be the latent variables and allowed the effective reproduction number to change over time, thus the effects of policies could be reasonably estimated. By using the epidemic data of Wuhan, Wenzhou and Shenzhen, we migrated the corresponding estimated policy modes to South Korea, Italy, and the United States and simulated the potential outcomes for these countries when they adopted similar policy strategies of three cities in China. We found that the mild interventions implemented in Shenzhen were effective to control the epidemic in the early stage, while more stringent policies which were issued in Wuhan and Wenzhou were necessary if the epidemic was more severe and needed to be controlled in a short time.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Tian","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingwen Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Shiyun Lin","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yukang Jiang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianbin Tan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhongfei Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Wang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Hang Chang","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lonneke van Bijsterveldt","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pien Verreijdt","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, VUmc School of Medical Sciences, VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Logan Brunner","author_inst":"TNO, Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, The Hague, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marceline Tutu van Furth","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Emma Childrens Hos"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"}]}
