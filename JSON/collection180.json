Transfusion of convalescent plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 disease has emerged as a promising therapy and has been granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We recently reported results from interim analysis of a propensity-score matched study suggesting that early treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing high titer anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG significantly decreases mortality. We here present results from 60-day follow up of our cohort of 351 transfused hospitalized patients. Prospective determination of ELISA anti-RBD IgG titer facilitated selection and transfusion of the highest titer units available. Retrospective analysis by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay revealed a median signal\/cutoff (S\/C) ratio of 24.0 for transfused units, a value far exceeding the recently FDA-required cutoff of 12.0 for designation of high titer convalescent plasma. With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours post-hospitalization for transfusing COVID-19 patients with high titer convalescent plasma. In the aggregate, the analysis confirms and extends our previous preliminary finding that transfusion of COVID-19 patients soon after hospitalization with high titer anti-spike protein RBD IgG present in convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Salazar","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paul A.

Most Phase 3 trials have adopted virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease as the primary efficacy endpoint, although laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 is also of interest. In addition, it is important to evaluate the effect of vaccination on disease severity. To provide a full picture of vaccine efficacy and make efficient use of available data, we propose using SARS- CoV-2 infection, COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 as dual or triple primary endpoints. We demonstrate the advantages of this strategy through realistic simulation studies. Finally, we show how this approach can provide rigorous interim monitoring of the trials and efficient assessment of the durability of vaccine efficacy.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan-Yu Lin","author_inst":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Donglin Zeng","author_inst":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Devan V.

Aim of this study was to assess the impact of different pathogen reduction technologies on the immunological properties of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Materials and Methods In our experiment 140 doses of plasma collected by plasmapheresis from COVID-19 convalescent donors were subjected to pathogen reduction with one of three different methods: methylene blue (M), riboflavin (R), and amotosalen (A). To conduct a paired two-sample comparison each plasma dose was divided into 2 that were treated by one of these technologies. The titres of SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) and levels of specific immunoglobulins to RBD, S- and N- proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were measured before and after pathogen reduction. Results All methods reduced NtAbs titers significantly but not at the same grade: among units with the initial titre 80 or above, 81% of units had unchanged titres while 19% decreased by 1 step after methylene blue; 60% unchanged and 40% - decreased by 1 step after amotosalen; 43% unchanged, 67% a one-step decrease and 6% - a two-step decrease after riboflavin. Pairwise two-sample comparisons (M vs A, M vs R and A vs R) revealed the most prominent and statistically significant decrease in all studied parameters (except anti-RBD) following pathogen reduction with riboflavin. Conclusion Pathogen reduction with amotosalen and methylene blue provides the greater likelihood of preserving the immunological properties of the COVID-19 convalescent plasma compared to riboflavin.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander I Kostin","author_inst":"Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Maria N Lundgren","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Office of Medical Services,  Region Skane, Lund, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Andrey Y Bulanov","author_inst":"Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Elena A Ladygina","author_inst":"Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Karina Chirkova","author_inst":"Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Alexander Gintsburg","author_inst":"National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology N.F.

Researchers have invested tremendous efforts to develop vaccines or effective drug therapy but have not yet been fruitful. Hence, we planned to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis to supplement the readers with comprehensive data and credible information on the safety and efficacyof essential pharmacotherapy during the pharmacological management of COVID-19. Methods: Theprotocol will be designed based on the updated PRISMA-P 2015 guidelines. An elaborate search of electronic databases such as PubMed\/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, Medrxiv and other potential databases for articles published during January 2020 to 10 October 2020 is planned to be conducted. Following this,randomized control trials published in English language that assess the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy versusplacebo or standard of care or usual care will be evaluated for inclusion. The primary outcomes will include time to clinical recovery and the probability for the negative conversion of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes will quantifythe proportion of patients relieved of symptoms, the all-cause mortality, morbidity, detection of viral RNA, time needed to achieve a negative viral load, ordinal scale changes, ventilatorand oxygen requirements,length of hospital stayand the incidence of adverse and serious adverse events.RevMan V.5.3 computer software packages will be utilised to conduct an accurate statistical analysis of the study. Thebinary random-effects model will be used at a 95 % confidence interval to estimate the weighted effect size ofdichotomous data and continuous data studies. The results of statistical analysis will be considered statistically significant whena p-value <0.05 is attained. Results: Selected studies will be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy used during the management of the novel COVID-19. Conclusion: This study will be a qualitative and quantitative pool of comprehensive evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy on COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sujit Kumar Sah","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy Practice, JSS College of pharmacy,  JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, SS Nagar, Mysuru-570015 Karnataka, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Undela","author_inst":"Associate Professor\t Department of Pharmacy Practice, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Guwahati, Assam, India"},{"author_name":"Dr. Sharad Chand","author_inst":"NGSMIPS, Nitte (Deemed to be University)"},{"author_name":"Madhan Ramesh","author_inst":"Professor & Head Department of Pharmacy Practice, JSS College of pharmacy JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, SS Nagar, Mysuru-570015"},{"author_name":"Subramanian R","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology & Immunology, JSS Medical College & Hospital JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, SS Nagar, Mysuru-570015"},{"author_name":"Oliver Joel Gona","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy Practice, JSS College of pharmacy  JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, SS Nagar, Mysuru-570015"},{"author_name":"Sophia M.

Combined metabolic cofactors supplementation (CMCS) consisting of L-serine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and L-carnitine tartrate is being studied for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a placebo-controlled, phase-2 clinical trial involving ambulatory COVID-19 patients. A total of 100 patients were randomly assigned on a 3:1 basis to hydroxychloroquine plus CMCS or hydroxychloroquine plus placebo. The total treatment period for the hydroxychloroquine was 5 days, and for the CMCS\/placebo was 14 days. Clinical status was evaluated daily by phone, using a binomial scale for subject reported presence or absence for multiple COVID-19 related symptoms. Plasma samples for clinical chemistry analyses were collected on day 0 and day 14. RESULTS A total of 93 patients completed the trial. The combination of CMCS and hydroxychloroquine significantly reduced the average complete recovery time compared with hydroxychloroquine and placebo (6.6 days vs 9.3 days, respectively). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in ALT, AST and LDH levels on day 14 compared to day 0 in the hydroxychloroquine plus CMCS group. The adverse effects were uncommon and self-limiting. CONCLUSIONS In patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, CMCS resulted in a significant reduction in recovery time and liver enzymes associated with hepatic function compared to placebo. We observed that CMSC is associated with a low incidence of adverse events.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"OZLEM ALTAY","author_inst":"Science for Life Laboratory, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"HONG YANG","author_inst":"Science for Life Laboratory, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"MEHTAP AYDIN","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Gizem Alkurt","author_inst":"Genomic Laboratory (GLAB), Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"NILSUN ALTUNAL","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"WOONGHEE KIM","author_inst":"Science for Life Laboratory, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"DOGUKAN AKYOL","author_inst":"Genomic Laboratory (GLAB), Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"MUHAMMED ARIF","author_inst":"Science for Life Laboratory, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Cheng Zhang","author_inst":"Royal Institute of Technology, KTH"},{"author_name":"Gizem Dinler-Doganay","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"HASAN TURKEZ","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Ataturk University, Erzurum, Turkey"},{"author_name":"SAEED SHOAIE","author_inst":"Centre for Host-Microbiome Interactions, Faculty of Dentistry, Oral Craniofacial Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"JENS NIELSEN","author_inst":"Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"JAN BOREN","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"LEVENT DOGANAY","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"MATHIAS UHLEN","author_inst":"Science for Life Laboratory, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Adil Mardinoglu","author_inst":"KTH-Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Stanislav Volkov","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Nataliya E Drozdova","author_inst":"Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Sergey S Petrikov","author_inst":"Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine, Moscow, Russia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.02.20203356","rel_title":"An improved and readily available version of Bst DNA Polymerase for LAMP, and applications to COVID-19 diagnostics","rel_date":"2020-10-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.02.20203356","rel_abs":"Despite the fact that strand-displacing activity is of great utility for a variety of applications, including isothermal amplification assays, there are relatively few strand-displacing DNA polymerases.

However, despite its wide use, its properties remain open to improvement, as has been demonstrated by a variety of engineering efforts, including the identification of point mutations that impact its robustness, strand-displacement capabilities, and nascent reverse transcriptase activity. Interestingly, a strategy that has been commonly used to alter the capabilities of DNA polymerases, the addition of additional DNA- or RNA-binding domains, has yet to be applied to Bst DNAP. To this end, we now show that by adding fusion domains the performance of Bst DNAP in isothermal amplification assays, including its nascent RT activity, can be greatly improved. The impact of these improvements on the development of LAMP assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is fully explored.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre Maranhao","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Sanchita Bhadra","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Inyup Paik","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"David Walker","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Ellington","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"WOONGHEE KIM","author_inst":"Science for Life Laboratory, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"DOGUKAN AKYOL","author_inst":"Genomic Laboratory (GLAB), Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"MUHAMMED ARIF","author_inst":"Science for Life Laboratory, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Cheng Zhang","author_inst":"Royal Institute of Technology, KTH"},{"author_name":"Gizem Dinler-Doganay","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"HASAN TURKEZ","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Ataturk University, Erzurum, Turkey"},{"author_name":"SAEED SHOAIE","author_inst":"Centre for Host-Microbiome Interactions, Faculty of Dentistry, Oral Craniofacial Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"JENS NIELSEN","author_inst":"Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"JAN BOREN","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"LEVENT DOGANAY","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"MATHIAS UHLEN","author_inst":"Science for Life Laboratory, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Adil Mardinoglu","author_inst":"KTH-Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Stanislav Volkov","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Nataliya E Drozdova","author_inst":"Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Sergey S Petrikov","author_inst":"Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine, Moscow, Russia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.02.20205633","rel_title":"Testing mobile air purifiers in a school classroom: Reducing the airborne transmission risk for SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-10-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.02.20205633","rel_abs":"Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through virus-containing aerosol particles has been established as an important pathway for Covid-19 infection. Suitable measures to prevent such infections are imperative, especially in situations when a high number of persons convene in closed rooms. Here we tested the efficiency and practicability of operating four air purifiers equipped with HEPA filters in a high school classroom while regular classes were taking place. We monitored the aerosol number concentration for particles > 3 nm at two locations in the room, the aerosol size distribution in the range from 10 nm to 10 m, PM10 and CO2 concentration. For comparison, we performed similar measurements in a neighboring classroom without purifiers. In times when classes were conducted with windows and door closed, the aerosol concentration was reduced by more than 90 % within less than 30 minutes when running the purifiers (air exchange rate 5.5 h-1). The reduction was homogeneous throughout the room and for all particle sizes. The measurements are supplemented by a calculation estimating the maximum concentration levels of virus-containing aerosol from a highly contagious person speaking in a closed room with and without air purifiers. Measurements and calculation demonstrate that air purifiers represent a well suited measure to reduce the risks of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 substantially.

Design: This is a retrospective, observational study. Forty-six out of 79 NICUs (58%) from 17 countries participated. Principal investigators were asked to report the following information: 1) Total number of EP infant admissions to their NICU in the three months where the lockdown restrictions were most rigorous during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) Similar EP infant admissions in the corresponding three months of 2019, 3) the level of local restrictions during the lockdown period and 4) the local impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the everyday life of a pregnant woman. Results: There was no significant difference between the number of EP infant admissions during the three most rigorous lockdown months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the corresponding three months in 2019 (n=428 versus n=457 respectively, p=0.33). There were no significant changes within individual geographic regions and no significant association between the level of lockdown restrictions and change in the number of EP infant admissions (p=0.334). Conclusion: This larger ad hoc study did not confirm previous studies report of a major reduction in the number of extremely preterm births during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":49,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marie Isabel Rasmussen","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Mathias Luehr Hansen","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Gerhard Pichler","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria"},{"author_name":"Eugene Dempsey","author_inst":"Infant Centre and Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork, College Road, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Adelina Pellicer","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Afif EL-Khuffash","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Shashidhar A","author_inst":"St. Johns Medical College Hospital, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Salvador Piris-Borregas","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, 12 Octubre University Hospital.

Objectives: This study assessed willingness to disclose symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and willingness to take COVID-19 test as well as their predictors. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 524 Nigerian adults, aged [&ge;] 18 years, residing in Nigeria and who had not taken the COVID-19 test was conducted. Information on willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms, take COVID-19 test and possible predictors were collected. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics evaluated at 5% significance level. Results: Mean age of respondents was 35.8 (S.D: 10.7) years and 57.0% were males. Majority (85.8% and 86.2% respectively) were willing to disclose COVID-19 symptoms and take COVID-19 test. Self-risk perception of contracting COVID-19 predicted both willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms (aOR=3.236; 95%CI=1.836-5.704) and take COVID-19 test (aOR=3.174; 95%CI=1.570-6.419). Willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms (aOR=13.060; 95%CI= 6.253-27.276), knowledge of someone who had taken the test (aOR= 4.106; 95%CI= 1.179-14.299) and thought that it was important for people to know their COVID-19 status (aOR=3.123; 95%CI= 1.516-6.434) also predicted willingness to take COVID-19 test. Conclusion: Nigerians are willing to disclose symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and take the COVID-19 test. Investment in interventions developed based on the predicting factors will help speed up the finding and testing of suspected COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Victoria Oluwabunmi Oladoyin","author_inst":"University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Oluyemi Adewole Okunlola","author_inst":"University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Oluwaseyi Kikelomo Israel","author_inst":"Bowen University, Iwo, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Demilade Olusola Ibirongbe","author_inst":"University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Joy Atonirehonmon Osifo","author_inst":"University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Taiwo Akinyode Obembe","author_inst":"University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Paulinus Kunle Omode","author_inst":"Ondo State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Akure, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Olugbenga Olusegun Osunmakinwa","author_inst":"University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Miguel Alsina","author_inst":"Neonatology Department, Hospital Clinic-Maternintat, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Merih Cetinkaya","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Lina Chalak","author_inst":"Division of Pediatrics - Neonatal-Perinatal, UT Southwestern, United States"},{"author_name":"Hilal Ozkan","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Uludag University Medical Faculty, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Mariana Baserga","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan Sirc","author_inst":"Institute for the Care of Mother and Child, Prague, Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Hans Fuchs","author_inst":"Center for Pediatrics, Department of Neonatology, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ebru Ergenekon","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Gazi University Hospital, Yenimahalle\/Ankara, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Luis Arruza","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology.

Samples were collected in a drive-through car line for symptomatic individuals (N=380) and in the emergency department (ED) (N=69). The percent positive and negative agreement of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab were 81.1% (95% CI: 65.8% - 90.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI: 98.7% - 100%), respectively. The sensitivity increased to 90.0% (95% CI: 74.4% - 96.5%) when considering only samples with moderate to high viral load (Cycle threshold (Ct) for the NP <=34). Pools of five saliva specimens were also evaluated on three platforms: bioMerieux NucliSENS easyMAG with ABI 7500Fast (CDC assay), Hologic Panther Fusion, and Roche COBAS 6800. The median loss of signal upon pooling was 2-4 Ct values across the platforms. The sensitivity of detecting a positive specimen in a pool compared with testing individually was 100%, 93%, and 95% for CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR, Panther Fusion(R) SARS-CoV-2 assay, and cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 test respectively, with decreased sample detection trending with lower viral load. We conclude that although pooled saliva testing, as collected in this study, is not quite as sensitive as NP\/MT testing, saliva testing is adequate to detect individuals with higher viral loads in an asymptomatic screening program, does not require swabs or viral transport media for collection, and may help to improve voluntary screening compliance for those individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bidisha Barat","author_inst":"Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Sanchita Das","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Valeria De Giorgi","author_inst":"Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"David K.

It compares the effects of infected person[s] shedding virus in multiple indoor and outdoor settings and estimates resulting infection potential at multiple severities based on exposure time. Key information needed to perform this aerosolized viral load exposure time estimation analysis and clinical severity likelihood interpretation includes measured amounts of SARS-CoV-2 in the air of a hospital room with COVID-19 patients and known Influenza A challenge escalation doses; both of which are obtained from peer-reviewed and published studies. Information from ASHRAE Office Ventilation standards and an Outdoor Air Exchange model are also utilized. While these estimations have unknown error margins and cannot be considered authoritative, they may have utility in comparing various environments and relative risk factors. The estimates in this study also present an initial framework and specific quantitative examples for better understanding of the effects of ventilation on aerosolized transmission, and the immunology related to graduated challenge doses, and the potential for low-level viral load exposure to result in some level of immunity without symptoms of illness (asymptomatic infection). This study finds that outdoor environments reduce transmission risk by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to common indoor environments, that improved ventilation can reduce risk within indoor environments, and suggests that environments with diluted viral loads improves the probability of developing protective immunity while limiting symptoms and illness. This study s multiple examples of specific quantitative viral load exposure levels versus symptoms and immune response, and simplified descriptions of the quantitative differences between protective vs pathologic exposure levels, could provide an intriguing inductive learning tool that protectively guides individual behavior within the general public.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David E.

As SARS-CoV-2 sequences highlight wide changes across the samples, we aim to explore whether these changes reveal the geographical origin of the corresponding samples. The k-mer distributions, denoting normalized frequency counts of all possible combinations of nucleotide of size upto k, are often helpful to explore sequence level patterns. Given the SARS-CoV-2 sequences are highly imbalanced by its geographical origin (relatively with a higher number samples collected from the USA), we observe that with proper under-sampling k-mer distributions in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences predict its geographical origin with more than 90% accuracy. The experiments are performed on the samples collected from six countries with maximum number of sequences available till July 07, 2020. This comprises SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Australia, USA, China, India, Greece and France. Moreover, we demonstrate that the changes of genomic sequences characterize the continents as a whole. We also highlight that the network motifs present in the sequence similarity networks have a significant difference across the said countries.

We sought to understand the variation in the risk of COVID 19 related death across religious groups in the UK both before and after lockdown. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of usual residents in England and Wales enumerated at the 2011 Census (n = 48,422,583), for risk of death involving COVID-19 using linked death certificates. Cox regression models were estimated to compare risks between religious groups. Time dependent religion coefficients were added to the model allowing hazard ratios (HRs) pre and post lockdown period to be estimated separately. Results Compared to Christians all religious groups had an elevated risk of death involving COVID-19; the largest age adjusted HRs were for Muslim and Jewish males at 2.5 (95% confidence interval 2.3-2.7) and 2.1 (1.9-2.5), respectively. The corresponding HRs for Muslim and Jewish females were 1.9 (1.7-2.1) and 1.5 (1.7-2.1). The difference in risk between groups contracted after lockdown. Those who affiliated with no religion had the lowest risk of COVID 19 related death before and after lockdown. Conclusion The majority of the variation in COVID 19 mortality risk was explained by controlling for socio demographic and geographic determinants; however, Jews remained at a higher risk of death compared to all other groups. Lockdown measures were associated with reduced differences in COVID 19 mortality rates between religious groups, further research is required to understand the causal mechanisms.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charlotte Gaughan","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ayoubkhani","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Vahe Nafilyan","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Peter Goldblatt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Chris White","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Karen Tingay","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Neil Bannister","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Theresa Moriarty","author_inst":"MedStar Washington Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Tara N.

An objective was to take advantage of extensive recently published work to facilitate process development, principally primer selection, and to use readily available off the shelf materials with conventional lab procedure and equipment. Well-developed and referenced primers for ORF1a, E, and N-gene targets were selected and applied, using commercially available synthetic RNA standards, and raw sewage from a local wastewater agency serving 650,000. County health department monitoring provided current COVID-19 data. Testing defined performance characteristics for each primer set, with significant differences between them. Specific amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed using each of the primer sets, with E-gene and N-gene primers most effective. Positive analysis results from all raw sewage samples corresponded to calculated concentrations of virus in 5-10 L raw sewage aliquots for 25 L reactions. Results show that even at low reported case rates e.g. 1-10\/100,000, SARS-CoV-2 is present in raw sewage at > 1-5\/ L, permitting direct LAMP-based detection.

Here, we aimed at exploring for the first time the effect of COVID-19-lockdown on subjective cognitive functioning as well as mental health, in terms of its prevalence and clinical severity. In addition, potential risk factors characterizing more vulnerable groups were investigated. A nationwide cross-sectional online-survey was conducted during the final phase of lockdown in Italy (after 7-10 weeks of home confinement), leading to a sample of 1215 participants. We found lockdown can have a severe impact on subjective cognitive functioning, along with mental health disorders. Namely, under restrictions, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in everyday tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions; while no changes in language abilities were reported. Conversely, a paradoxical effect was observed in memory domain, with people experiencing a reduction of memory failures compared to pre-lockdown times. Further, higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders and of other psychological issues (involving sleep, appetite, libido and hypochondria) were observed - with a prevalence of mild-to-severe depression and anxiety rising up to 32.30% and 35.72% respectively, under restrictions. Being female, young (<45 years), repeatedly exposed to COVID-19-media, working from home or being unemployed were identified as relevant risk factors for experiencing cognitive worsening and mental health disorders, related to the COVID-19 lockdown. Being resident in high infection-prevalence areas was related to higher level of depression and health anxiety. As lockdown and quarantine measures could be reimposed, health officials have to carefully consider these more vulnerable groups in their decision-making process, to develop an effective global and long-term response to the mental health challenges of this pandemic as well as to implement psychological interventions and specific guidelines, particularly about COVID-19-media exposure.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eleonora Fiorenzato","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Silvia Zabberoni","author_inst":"IRCCS Fondazione Santa Lucia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Costa","author_inst":"IRCCS Fondazione Santa Lucia"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Cona","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Chris White","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Karen Tingay","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Neil Bannister","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Theresa Moriarty","author_inst":"MedStar Washington Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Tara N.

Knowing intended uptake is essential to inform supply and steer public health messaging to maximise vaccination given the combined threats of both flu and Covid-19 - the unknown impact of which on both attitudes and the need for mass uptake yet again create the threat of ill-informed planning resulting in failure to meet necessary public health demand. Methods: An online questionnaire posing question items on influenza vaccination was administered to registrants of the Care Information Exchange (CIE), the NHS's largest patient electronic personal health record. This was part of a longitudinal study initiated during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. This analysis was limited to those who, in line with established NHS criteria, were previously or newly eligible but had not routinely received seasonal influenza vaccination in the past. Groups were stratified by response (yes\/no) to intending to receive flu vaccination in 2020-21: Group 1.) Previously eligible now responding \"yes\", 2.) Previously eligible still responding \"no\", 3.) Newly eligible responding \"yes\", and 4.) Newly eligible responding \"no\". Within these groups, response by health worker status and each group's inclination to vaccinate school age children was also measured. Summary statistics were reported alongside univariate and multivariable regression. Lastly, a network analysis visualised the frequency and co-occurrence of reasons qualifying response for or against influenza vaccination in 2020\/21. Findings: Among 6,641 respondents, 4,040 (61.1%) had previously routinely received the flu vaccination. 1,624 (24.5%) had been either previously eligible but not vaccinated (945, 58.2%) or newly eligible (679, 41.8%). Among the previously eligible participants who had not routinely received influenza vaccination 536 (56.7%) responded they would in 2020-21, increasing the vaccination rate in the entire previously eligible cohort from 79.6% to 91.2%, and 466 (68.6%) in the newly eligible. Multivariable logistic regression resulted in few substantial changes to effect estimates, with the exception of age, for which all estimates showed a stronger association with intention to receive the flu vaccine. In those who became newly eligible to receive the flu vaccine, there was an association between intention to receive the flu vaccine and increased age (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12), IMD quintile, and considering oneself at high risk from Covid-19 (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.70). Network analysis showed the most frequent themes for previously eligible unvaccinated and newly eligible participants accepting vaccination in 2020\/21 were: \"precaution for myself\" (41.2% and 46.1%) and \"Covid-19\" (27.4% and 27.1%), where the former was qualified by the latter in 36% and 29.1% of responses. Among the previously and newly eligible not intending to receive vaccination in 2020\/21, misinformed themes of \"makes me unwell\", \"gives me flu\" and \"vaccine doesn't work\" were present across 37.4% and 21.9% of responses, respectively. Among participants with school age children, of those previously eligible who now intend to be vaccinated themselves, 82.5% also intend to vaccinate their children in 2020\/21 compared to 25.8% of those who would not accept the influenza vaccine for themselves. Among the newly eligible respondents this was 82.1% and 43.5%, respectively. 49.9% of the previously unvaccinated healthcare workers would continue to decline the vaccine in 2020\/21. Interpretation: In this UK-wide observational study, Covid-19 has increased acceptance of flu vaccination in 2020\/21 from 79.6% to 91.2% in those previously eligible, and for the 69% of those newly eligible. This high anticipated vaccination rate (to 26 million (80%) of the UK population) requires appropriate planning, but can be further increased with effective messaging campaigns to address negative misconceptions about flu vaccination, which may also help in preparation for future Covid-19 vaccination. It remains of concern that 50% of healthcare professionals who refused it previously still do not intend to have the flu vaccine.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrik Bachtiger","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alex Adamson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ji-Jian Chow","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rupa Sisodia","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Quint","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Bannister","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Theresa Moriarty","author_inst":"MedStar Washington Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Tara N.

Objective: We filled this gap by assessing relevant data availability and quality across states, and in states with available data, investigating how racial-ethnic disparities in CFR changed after age adjustment. Design\/Setting\/Participants\/Exposure: We conducted a landscape analysis as of July 1st, 2020 and developed a grading system to assess COVID-19 case and death data by age and race in 50 states and DC. In states where age- and race-specific data were available, we applied direct age standardization to compare CFR across race-ethnicities. We developed an online dashboard to automatically and continuously update our results. Main Outcome and Measure: Our main outcome was CFR (deaths per 100 confirmed cases). We examined CFR by age and race-ethnicities. Results: We found substantial variations in disaggregating and reporting case and death data across states. Only three states, California, Illinois and Ohio, had sufficient age- and race-ethnicity-disaggregation to allow the investigation of racial-ethnic disparities in CFR while controlling for age. In total, we analyzed 391,991confirmed cases and 17,612 confirmed deaths. The crude CFRs varied from, e.g. 7.35% among Non-Hispanic (NH) White population to 1.39% among Hispanic population in Ohio. After age standardization, racial-ethnic differences in CFR narrowed, e.g. from 5.28% among NH White population to 3.79% among NH Asian population in Ohio, or an over one-fold difference. In addition, the ranking of race-ethnic-specific CFRs changed after age standardization. NH White population had the leading crude CFRs whereas NH Black and NH Asian population had the leading and second leading age-adjusted CFRs respectively in two of the three states. Hispanic populations age-adjusted CFR were substantially higher than the crude. Sensitivity analysis did not change these results qualitatively. Conclusions and Relevance: The availability and quality of age- and race-ethnic-specific COVID-19 case and death data varied greatly across states. Age distributions in confirmed cases obscured racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 CFR. Age standardization narrows racial-ethnic disparities and changes ranking. Public COVID-19 data availability, quality, and harmonization need improvement to address racial disparities in this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ishaan Pathak","author_inst":"Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Yoonjoung Choi","author_inst":"iSquared"},{"author_name":"Dazhi Jiao","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical and Translational Research, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Diana Yeung","author_inst":"Department of International Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Li Liu","author_inst":"Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Bannister","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Theresa Moriarty","author_inst":"MedStar Washington Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Tara N.

Machine learning solutions have been shown to be useful for X-ray analysis and classification in a range of medical contexts. The purpose of this study is to create and evaluate a machine learning model for diagnosis of COVID-19, and to provide a tool for searching for similar patients according to their X-ray scans. In this retrospective study, a classifier was built using a pre-trained deep learning model (ReNet50) and enhanced by data augmentation and lung segmentation to detect COVID-19 in frontal CXR images collected between January 2018 and July 2020 in four hospitals in Israel. A nearest-neighbors algorithm was implemented based on the network results that identifies the images most similar to a given image. The model was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and of the precision-recall (P-R) curve. The dataset sourced for this study includes 2362 CXRs, balanced for positive and negative COVID-19, from 1384 patients (63 +\/- 18 years, 552 men). Our model achieved 89.7% (314\/350) accuracy and 87.1% (156\/179) sensitivity in classification of COVID-19 on a test dataset comprising 15% (350 of 2326) of the original data, with AUC of ROC 0.95 and AUC of the P-R curve 0.94. For each image we retrieve images with the most similar DNN-based image embeddings; these can be used to compare with previous cases.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisha Goldstein","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Unit, Life Sciences Core Facilities, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Daphna Keidar","author_inst":"ETH zurich, D-INFK, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Yaron","author_inst":"Dept. of Math and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yair Shachar","author_inst":"Eyeway Vision Ltd., Yoni Netanyahu St 3, Or Yehuda"},{"author_name":"Ayelet Blass","author_inst":"Dept. of Math and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Leonid Charbinsky","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Israel Aharony","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Liza Lifshitz","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lumelsky","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ziv Neeman","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Matti Mizrachi","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Majd Hajouj","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Nethanel Eizenbach","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Eyal Sela","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Chedva Weiss","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Philip Levin","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofer Benjaminov","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gil N Bachar","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Shlomit Tamir","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Yael Rapson","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Dror Suhami","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"amiel a dror","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Naama Bogot","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ahuva Grubstein","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Nogah Shabsin","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yishai M Elyada","author_inst":"Mobileye Vision Technologies, Ltd., Hartom 13, Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Yonina Eldar","author_inst":"Dept. of Math and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Zhang Peng","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Childrens Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Despoina Gkentzi","author_inst":"NICU, Department of Pediatrics, University General Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Renaud Viellevoye","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,  CHR Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Julie De Buyst","author_inst":"NICU, Tivoli Hospital, La Louviere, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Emmanuele Mastretta","author_inst":"S.C.

Taking into account known risk factors, LT recipients a priori represented a high-risk cohort for severe COVID-19 with 101\/219 (46.1 %) presenting with more than 2 risk factors for severe COVID-19. Out of 219 LT recipients 8 (3.7%) were either tested positive for nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA or anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG. 5\/8 (62.5 %) did not show any clinical signs of infection, 3\/8 (37.5%) had self-limited disease, none required hospitalization for COVID-19. 5\/8 (67.5%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients showed high utilization of the healthcare system. 2\/8 (25 %) had known exposure to infected health care personal. A majority of 65.4 % often or always avoided outside family social contacts. Face masks were commonly worn by all patients.

Healthcare system, financial growth, industrial development and educational programme are stunted. Inevitably, professional training and education are affected which include the medical training of medical interns. Methods This is a cross-sectional, pilot study to determine the impact of the pandemic on University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) medical interns. A survey which comprises 37-items was used. Data are analysed by Ordinal Logistic Regression Analysis. Results Medical interns feel that they lack clinical skills (p = 0.005) and need more exposure in surgical operations (p =0.029). Some are satisfied with the introduction of triage (p = 0.024), online teaching (p = 0.005) and bedside teaching (p=0.023). Most of them think they are fit and ready to handle the pandemic (p = 0.012 and 0.025 respectively) except first year medical interns (p = 0.029). Some feel like their time are wasted (p <0.05) as they are involved in many non-clinical activities (p = 0.003). Conclusion In summary, COVID-19 has a great impact on medical training amongst medical interns. Alternative measures should be taken to minimize the interruption in training of our future leaders in medical field.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"WeiHonn Lim","author_inst":"University Malaya Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Li Ying Teoh","author_inst":"University of Malaya Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Kanesh Kumaran Seevalingam","author_inst":"University of Malaya Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Shanggar Kuppusamy","author_inst":"University of Malaya Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Frederike Lund","author_inst":"Universitaetsklinikum Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Philip Gath","author_inst":"Staedtisches Klinikum Ludwigshafen"},{"author_name":"Markus Mieth","author_inst":"Universitaetsklinikum Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Uta Merle","author_inst":"Universitaetsklinikum Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Christian Rupp","author_inst":"Universitaetsklinikum Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Ziv Neeman","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Matti Mizrachi","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Majd Hajouj","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Nethanel Eizenbach","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Eyal Sela","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Chedva Weiss","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Philip Levin","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofer Benjaminov","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gil N Bachar","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Shlomit Tamir","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Yael Rapson","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Dror Suhami","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"amiel a dror","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Naama Bogot","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ahuva Grubstein","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Nogah Shabsin","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yishai M Elyada","author_inst":"Mobileye Vision Technologies, Ltd., Hartom 13, Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Yonina Eldar","author_inst":"Dept. of Math and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Zhang Peng","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Childrens Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Despoina Gkentzi","author_inst":"NICU, Department of Pediatrics, University General Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Renaud Viellevoye","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,  CHR Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Julie De Buyst","author_inst":"NICU, Tivoli Hospital, La Louviere, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Emmanuele Mastretta","author_inst":"S.C.

The hematochemical values of routine blood exams could represent a faster and less expensive alternative. Methods: Three different training data set of hematochemical values from 1,624 patients (52% COVID19 positive), admitted at San Raphael Hospital (OSR) from February to May 2020, were used for developing machine learning (ML) models: the complete OSR dataset (72 features: complete blood count (CBC), biochemical, coagulation, hemogasanalysis and CO-Oxymetry values, age, sex and specific symptoms at triage) and two subdatasets (COVID specific and CBC dataset, 32 and 21 features respectively). 58 cases (50% COVID19 positive) from another hospital, and 54 negative patients collected in 2018 at OSR, were used for internal external and external validation. Results: We developed five ML models: for the complete OSR dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.83 to 0.90; for the COVID specific dataset from 0.83 to 0.87; and for the CBC dataset from 0.74 to 0.86. The validations also achieved good results: respectively, AUC from 0.75 to 0.78; and specificity from 0.92 to 0.96. Conclusions: ML can be applied to blood tests as both an adjunct and alternative method to rRT PCR for the fast and cost-effective identification of COVID19 positive patients. This is especially useful in developing countries, or in countries facing an increase in contagions.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Federico Cabitza","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemistica e Comunicazione, University of Milano-Bicocca"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campagner","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Orthopaedic Biotechnology Lab"},{"author_name":"Davide Ferrari","author_inst":"SCVSA Department, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Chiara Di Resta","author_inst":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; Unit of Genomics for Human Disease Diagnosis, Division of Genetics and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Daniele Ceriotti","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Sabetta","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Colombini","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Orthopaedic Biotechnology Lab"},{"author_name":"Elena De Vecchi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Orthopaedic Biotechnology Lab"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Banfi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Orthopaedic Biotechnology Lab"},{"author_name":"Massimo Locatelli","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Carobene","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Majd Hajouj","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Nethanel Eizenbach","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Eyal Sela","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Chedva Weiss","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Philip Levin","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofer Benjaminov","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gil N Bachar","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Shlomit Tamir","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Yael Rapson","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Dror Suhami","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"amiel a dror","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Naama Bogot","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ahuva Grubstein","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Nogah Shabsin","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yishai M Elyada","author_inst":"Mobileye Vision Technologies, Ltd., Hartom 13, Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Yonina Eldar","author_inst":"Dept. of Math and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Zhang Peng","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Childrens Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Despoina Gkentzi","author_inst":"NICU, Department of Pediatrics, University General Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Renaud Viellevoye","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,  CHR Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Julie De Buyst","author_inst":"NICU, Tivoli Hospital, La Louviere, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Emmanuele Mastretta","author_inst":"S.C.

The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-1 causes pneumonitis in mice which shares many pathological characteristics with human SARS-CoV infection. Previous studies have shown that the amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has anti-inflammatory effects. We tested whether oral treatment with GABA could modulate the MHV-1 induced pneumonitis in susceptible A\/J mice. As expected, MHV-1-inoculated control mice became severely ill (as measured by weight loss, clinical score, and the ratio of lung weight to body weight) and >60% of them succumbed to the infection. In contrast, mice that received GABA immediately after MHV-1 inoculation became only mildly ill and all of them recovered. When GABA treatment was initiated after the appearance of illness (3 days post-MHV-1 infection), we again observed that GABA treatment significantly reduced the severity of illness and greatly increased the frequency of recovery. Therefore, the engagement of GABA receptors (GABA-Rs) prevented the MHV-1 infection-induced severe pneumonitis and death in mice. Given that GABA-R agonists, like GABA and homotaurine, are safe for human consumption, stable, inexpensive, and available worldwide, they are promising candidates to help prevent severe illness stemming from SARS-CoV-2 infection and other coronavirus strains.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jide Tian","author_inst":"Univeristy of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Blake Milddleton","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Daniel L Kaufman","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chiara Di Resta","author_inst":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; Unit of Genomics for Human Disease Diagnosis, Division of Genetics and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Daniele Ceriotti","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Sabetta","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Colombini","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Orthopaedic Biotechnology Lab"},{"author_name":"Elena De Vecchi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Orthopaedic Biotechnology Lab"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Banfi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Orthopaedic Biotechnology Lab"},{"author_name":"Massimo Locatelli","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Carobene","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Majd Hajouj","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Nethanel Eizenbach","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Eyal Sela","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Chedva Weiss","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Philip Levin","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofer Benjaminov","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gil N Bachar","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Shlomit Tamir","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Yael Rapson","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Dror Suhami","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"amiel a dror","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Naama Bogot","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ahuva Grubstein","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Nogah Shabsin","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yishai M Elyada","author_inst":"Mobileye Vision Technologies, Ltd., Hartom 13, Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Yonina Eldar","author_inst":"Dept. of Math and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Zhang Peng","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Childrens Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Despoina Gkentzi","author_inst":"NICU, Department of Pediatrics, University General Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Renaud Viellevoye","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,  CHR Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Julie De Buyst","author_inst":"NICU, Tivoli Hospital, La Louviere, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Emmanuele Mastretta","author_inst":"S.C.

Although SARS-CoV-2 propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) often exhibit decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. Limited SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation occurs in human cells, which are the most relevant testing platforms. By performing serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the human hepatoma cell line clone Huh7.5, we selected viral populations with improved viability in human cells. Culture adaptation led to the emergence of a significant number of high frequency changes (>90% of the viral population) in the region coding for the spike glycoprotein, including a deletion of nine amino acids in the N-terminal domain and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). We demonstrated that the Huh7.5-adapted virus exhibited a >3-Log10 increase in infectivity titers (TCID50) in Huh7.5 cells, with titers of ~8 Log10TCID50\/mL, and >2-Log10 increase in the human lung cancer cell line Calu-1, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50\/mL. Culture adaptation in Huh7.5 cells further permitted efficient infection of the otherwise SARS-CoV-2 refractory human lung cancer cell line A549, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50\/mL. The enhanced ability of the virus to replicate and propagate in human cells permitted screening of a panel of nine nucs, including broad-spectrum compounds. Remdesivir, EIDD-2801 and to a limited extent galidesivir showed antiviral effect across these human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, uprifosbuvir, valopicitabine, mericitabine, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity.\n\nImportanceThe cell culture adapted variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained in the present study, showed significantly enhanced replication and propagation in various human cell lines, including lung derived cells otherwise refractory for infection with the original virus. This SARS-CoV-2 variant will be a valuable tool permitting investigations across human cell types, and studies of identified mutations could contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis. In particular, the adapted virus can be a good model for investigations of viral entry and cell tropism for SARS-CoV-2, in which the spike glycoprotein plays a central role. Further, as shown here with the use of remdesivir and EIDD-2801, two nucs with significant inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2, large differences in the antiviral activity are observed depending on the cell line. Thus, it is essential to select the most relevant target cells for pre-clinical screenings of antiviral compounds, facilitated by using a virus with broader tropism.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santseharay Ramirez","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlota Fernandez-Antunez","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Long Van Pham","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Line Abildgaard Ryberg","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shan Feng","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martin Schou Pedersen","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lotte Scheibelein Mikkelsen","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Judith M Gottwein","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ulrik Fahnoe","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jens Bukh","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anna Carobene","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Majd Hajouj","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Nethanel Eizenbach","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Eyal Sela","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Chedva Weiss","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Philip Levin","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofer Benjaminov","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gil N Bachar","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Shlomit Tamir","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Yael Rapson","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Dror Suhami","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"amiel a dror","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Naama Bogot","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ahuva Grubstein","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Nogah Shabsin","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yishai M Elyada","author_inst":"Mobileye Vision Technologies, Ltd., Hartom 13, Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Yonina Eldar","author_inst":"Dept. of Math and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Zhang Peng","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Childrens Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Despoina Gkentzi","author_inst":"NICU, Department of Pediatrics, University General Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Renaud Viellevoye","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,  CHR Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Julie De Buyst","author_inst":"NICU, Tivoli Hospital, La Louviere, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Emmanuele Mastretta","author_inst":"S.C.

We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks in LTCFs. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults >65 years in England with linkage to SARS-CoV-2 test results. Exposures included: LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, and use of disease control measures. Main outcomes included risk factors for infection and outbreaks, estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and survey and test-based weighted estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Findings: 5126\/9081 (56%) LTCFs participated in the survey, with 160,033 residents and 248,594 staff. The weighted period prevalence of infection in residents and staff respectively was 10.5% (95% CI: 9.9-11.1%) and 3.8% (95%: 3.4-4.2%) and 2724 LTCFs (53.1%) had at least one case of infection. Odds of infection and\/or outbreaks were reduced in LTCFs that paid sickness pay, cohorted staff, did not employ agency staff and had higher staff to resident ratios. Higher odds of infection and outbreaks were identified in facilities with more admissions, lower cleaning frequency, poor compliance with isolation and for profit status. Interpretation: Half of LTCFs had no cases suggesting they remain vulnerable to outbreaks. Reducing transmission from staff requires adequate sick pay, minimal use of temporary staff, improved staffing ratios and staff cohorting.

T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL)-dependent and TL shortens with age. Older persons are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19, and we hypothesized that those with short TL have less capacity to mount an adequate T-cell proliferative response to SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis predicts that among older patients with COVID-19, shorter telomeres of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be associated with a lower lymphocyte count. Methods: Our sample comprised 17 COVID-19 and 21 non-COVID-19 patients, aged 87(8) (mean(SD)) and 87 (9) years, respectively. We measured TL by the Telomere Shortest Length Assay, a novel method that measures and tallies the short telomeres directly relevant to telomere-mediated biological processes. The primary analysis quantified TL as the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kilobases. For comparison, we also quantified TL by Southern blotting, which measures the mean length of telomeres. Results: Lymphocyte count (109\/L) was 0.91 (0.42) in COVID-19 patients and 1.50(0.50) in non-COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). In COVID-19 patients, but not in non-COVID-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kilobases (P = 0.005) and positively correlated with the mean of telomeres measured by TeSLA (P = 0.03). Lymphocyte counts showed no statistically significant correlations with Southern blotting results in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that a compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response contributes to lymphopenia and the resulting disproportionate severity of COVID-19 among old adults. We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Athanase Benetos","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Tsung-Po Lai","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Simon Toupance","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Carlos Labat","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Simon Verhulst","author_inst":"Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences, University of Groningen,"},{"author_name":"Christine Perret-Guillaume","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Gautier","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur, Clinical Investigation and Access to Bioresources Department, Paris,"},{"author_name":"Daniel Levy","author_inst":"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Framingham Heart Study"},{"author_name":"Ezra Susser","author_inst":"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Abraham Aviv","author_inst":"Center of Human Development and Aging, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School,"},{"author_name":"Majd Hajouj","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Nethanel Eizenbach","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Eyal Sela","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Chedva Weiss","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Philip Levin","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofer Benjaminov","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gil N Bachar","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Shlomit Tamir","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Yael Rapson","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Dror Suhami","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"amiel a dror","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel; The Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Safed, Isra"},{"author_name":"Naama Bogot","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Imaging Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ahuva Grubstein","author_inst":"Radiology department, Rabin Medical Center, Jabotinsky Rd 39, Petah Tikva; Sakler School of Medicin, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv"},{"author_name":"Nogah Shabsin","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yishai M Elyada","author_inst":"Mobileye Vision Technologies, Ltd., Hartom 13, Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Yonina Eldar","author_inst":"Dept. of Math and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Zhang Peng","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Childrens Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Despoina Gkentzi","author_inst":"NICU, Department of Pediatrics, University General Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Renaud Viellevoye","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,  CHR Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Julie De Buyst","author_inst":"NICU, Tivoli Hospital, La Louviere, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Emmanuele Mastretta","author_inst":"S.C.

We assessed performance, limit of detection (LOD) and ease-of-use of three antigen-detecting, rapid POC diagnostics (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study, recruited participants suspected to have SARS-CoV2 in Germany and UK. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) or NP and\/or oropharyngeal swabs (OP) were collected from participants (one for clinical real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and one for Ag-RDT testing). Performance of each of three Ag-RDTs was compared to RT-PCR overall, and according to predefined subcategories e.g. cycle threshold (CT)-value, days from symptom onset, etc. In addition, limited verification of analytical limit-of-detection (LOD) was determined. To understand the usability of each Ag-RDT a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use assessment were performed. Results: Between April 17th and August 25th, 2020, 2417 participants were enrolled, with 70 (3.0%) testing positive by RT-PCR. The best-performing test (SD Biosensor, Inc. STANDARD Q) was 76.6% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 62.8-86.4] sensitive and 99.3% [CI 98.6-99.6] specific. A sub-analysis showed all samples with RT-PCR CT-values <25 were detectable by STANDARD Q. The test was considered easy-to-use (SUS 86\/100) and suitable for POC. Bioeasy and Coris showed specificity of 93.1% [CI 91.0%-94.8%] and 95.8% [CI 93.4%-97.4%], respectively, not meeting the predefined target of [&ge;]98%. Conclusion: There is large variability in performance of Ag-RDT tests with one test showing promise. Given the usability at POC, these tests are likely to have impact despite imperfect sensitivity; however further research and modelling are needed.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lisa Johanna Krueger","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mary Gaeddert","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lisa Koeppel","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lukas Bruemmer","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claudius Gottschalk","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Isabel Barreto Miranda","author_inst":"Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Paul Schnitzler","author_inst":"Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Kraeusslich","author_inst":"Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lindner","author_inst":"Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health; Institute o"},{"author_name":"Olga Nikolai","author_inst":"Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health; Institute o"},{"author_name":"Frank Mockenhaupt","author_inst":"Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health; Institute o"},{"author_name":"Joachim Seybold","author_inst":"Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health; Medical Dir"},{"author_name":"Victor M Corman","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin; Institute of Virology, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin; Institute of Virology, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nira Pollock","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Boston Childrens Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Ana Cubas-Atienzar","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Andreas Welker","author_inst":"Department Public Health Rhein Neckar Region, Germany"},{"author_name":"Margaretha DeVos","author_inst":"FIND, Geneva"},{"author_name":"Britta Knorr","author_inst":"Department Public Health Rhein Neckar Region, Germany"},{"author_name":"Angela H Wright","author_inst":"Centre of Drugs and Diagnostics,  Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Konstantina Kontogianni","author_inst":"Centre of Drugs and Diagnostics, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrea M Collins","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jilian Sacks","author_inst":"FIND, Geneva"},{"author_name":"Claudia M Denkinger","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yishai M Elyada","author_inst":"Mobileye Vision Technologies, Ltd., Hartom 13, Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Yonina Eldar","author_inst":"Dept. of Math and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Zhang Peng","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Childrens Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Despoina Gkentzi","author_inst":"NICU, Department of Pediatrics, University General Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Renaud Viellevoye","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,  CHR Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Julie De Buyst","author_inst":"NICU, Tivoli Hospital, La Louviere, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Emmanuele Mastretta","author_inst":"S.C.

We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings - a relevant tissue for SARS-CoV-2 infection - obtained from three cohorts of uninfected individuals, and investigated how non-genetic and genetic factors affect the regulation of host genes implicated in COVID-19. We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections. These data provide evidence that clinically relevant variation in the expression of COVID-19-related genes is associated with host factors, environmental exposures, and likely host genetic variation.","rel_num_authors":45,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silva Kasela","author_inst":"New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA;

There is a critical need for improvements in the noninvasive prognosis of COVID-19. We hypothesized that matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis combined with bottom-up proteomic analysis of plasma proteins might identify features to predict high and low risk cases of COVID-19. Patients and Methods: We used MALDI-TOF MS to analyze plasma small proteins and peptides isolated using C18 micro-columns from a cohort containing a total of 117 cases of high (hospitalized) and low risk (outpatients) cases split into training (n = 88) and validation sets (n= 29). The plasma protein\/peptide fingerprint obtained was used to train the algorithm before validation using a blinded test cohort. Results: Several sample preparation, MS and data analysis parameters were optimized to achieve an overall accuracy of 85%, sensitivity of 90%, and specificity of 81% in the training set. In the blinded test set, this signature reached an overall accuracy of 93.1%, sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 100%. From this signature, we identified two distinct regions in the MALDI-TOF profile belonging to the same proteoforms. A combination of 1D SDS-PAGE and quantitative bottom-up proteomic analysis allowed the identification of intact and truncated forms of serum amyloid A-1 and A-2 proteins. Conclusions: We found a plasma proteomic profile that discriminates against patients with high and low risk COVID-19. Proteomic analysis of C18-fractionated plasma may have a role in the noninvasive prognosis of COVID-19. Further validation will consolidate its clinical utility.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Cardoso Lazari","author_inst":"Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Fabio de Rose Ghilardi","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Livia Rosa-Fernandes","author_inst":"Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Diego M Assis","author_inst":"Bruker do Brasil, Atibaia, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jose Carlos Nicolau","author_inst":"Heart Institute (InCor), University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Veronica Feijoli Santiago","author_inst":"Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Talia F Dalcoquio","author_inst":"Heart Institute (InCor), University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Claudia Blanes Angeli","author_inst":"Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Adriadne Justi Bertolin","author_inst":"Heart Institute (InCor), University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Claudio Romero Farias Marinho","author_inst":"Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carsten Wrenger","author_inst":"Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Edison Luiz Durigon","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Rinaldo Focaccia Siciliano","author_inst":"Heart Institute (InCor), University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Palmisano","author_inst":"Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Cooper","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA"},{"author_name":"David J Couper","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"},{"author_name":"Gerard J Criner","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Medicine and Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Curtis","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA;

Methods: We designed a multicenter retrospective cohort study in three teaching hospitals of Castilla y Leon, Spain (865.096 people). We selected patients with confirmed COVID-19 and lung involvement with a pO2\/FiO2 < 300, excluding those exposed to immunosuppressors before or during hospitalization, patients terminally ill at admission, or died the first 24 hours. We performed a propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting covariates that modify the probability of being treated. Then we used a Cox regression model in the PSM group to consider factors affecting mortality. Results: From 2933 patients, 257 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 124 patients were on corticosteroid pulses, and 133 were not. 30,3% (37\/122) of patients died in the corticosteroid pulses group and 42,9% (57\/133) in the non-exposed cohort. These differences (12,6%) were statically significant (log-rank 4.72, p=0,03). We performed PSM using the exact method. Mortality differences remained in the PSM group (log-rank 5.31, p=0,021) and were still significant after a Cox regression model (HR for corticosteroid pulses 0,561, p= 0,039). There were no significant differences in intensive care admission rate (p=0,173). The hospital stay was longer in the corticosteroid group (p<0,001). Conclusions: This study provides evidence about treatment with corticosteroid pulses in severe COVID-19 that might significantly reduce mortality. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria with that selection process set a reliable frame to compare mortality in both exposed and non-exposed groups.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ivan Cusacovich","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valladolid"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Aparisi","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico de Valladolid.
