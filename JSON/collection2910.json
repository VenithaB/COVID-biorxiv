The Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) has been strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality in multiple diseases. Objective: To assess if elevated RDW is associated with unfavorable outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively studied clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients for their RDW values. In-hospital mortality was defined as primary outcome, while septic shock, need for mechanical ventilation, and length of stay (LOS) were secondary outcomes. Results- A total of 294 COVID-19 patients were finally studied. Overall prevalence of increased RDW was 49.7% (146\/294). RDW was associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality (aOR, 4.5; 95%CI, 1.4-14.3) and septic shock (aOR, 4.6; 95%CI, 1.4-15.1) after adjusting for anemia, ferritin, and lactate. The association remained unchanged even after adjusting for other clinical confounders such as age, sex, body mass index, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No association was found instead with mechanical ventilation and median LOS. Conclusion: Elevated RDW in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality and septic shock.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Preethi Ramachandran","author_inst":"Brookdale University Hospital and Medical center"},{"author_name":"Mahesh Gajendran","author_inst":"TTUHSC El Paso"},{"author_name":"Abhilash Perisetti","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Karim Osama Elkholy","author_inst":"Brookdale University Hospital and Medical center"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Chakraborti","author_inst":"Brookdale University Hospital and Medical center"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lippi","author_inst":"UniversityHospital of Verona"},{"author_name":"Hemant Goyal","author_inst":"Wright Center for Graduate Medical Education"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.30.20143289","rel_title":"Hydroxychloroquine has no effect on SARS-CoV-2 load in nasopharynx of patients with mild form of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.30.20143289","rel_abs":"Due to the constantly growing numbers of COVID-19 infections and death cases attempts were undertaken to find drugs with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity among ones already approved for other pathologies. In the framework of such attempts, in a number of in vitro, as well as in vivo, models it was shown that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has an effect against SARS-CoV-2. While there was not enough clinical data to support the use of HCQ, several countries including Russia have included HCQ in treatment protocols for infected patients and for prophylactic. Here, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharynx swabs from infected patients in mild conditions and compared the viral RNA load dynamics between patients receiving HCQ and control group without antiviral pharmacological therapy. We found statistically significant relationship between maximal RNA quantity and patients' deteriorating medical conditions, as well as confirmed the arterial hypertension to be a risk factor for people with COVID-19. However, we showed that HCQ therapy neither shortened the viral shedding period nor reduced the virus RNA load.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexey Komissarov","author_inst":"Clinical City Hospital named after I.V.

A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission can result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can produce large reductions in overall transmission rates. Here, we present a compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level heterogeneity in transmission using previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for COVID-19 epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically distinct settings---Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties, California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta (Dekalb and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. We find the effective reproduction number RE dropped below 1 rapidly following social distancing orders in mid-March, 2020 and remained there into June in Santa Clara County and Seattle, but climbed above 1 in late May in Los Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta, and has trended upward in all locations since April. With the fitted model, we ask: how does truncating the tail of the individual-level transmission rate distribution affect epidemic dynamics and control? We find interventions that truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on epidemic growth on par with the strongest population-wide social distancing observed in April, 2020. Given that social distancing interventions will be needed to maintain epidemic control until a vaccine becomes widely available, \"chopping off the tail\" to reduce the probability of superspreading events presents a promising option to alleviate the need for extreme general social distancing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Morgan P Kain","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Marissa L Childs","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Alexander D Becker","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Erin A Mordecai","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Svetlana Kudryavtseva","author_inst":"Clinical City Hospital named after I.V.

Medication non-adherence can blur drug efficacy results in clinical trials, lead to substantial financial losses, increase the risk of relapse and hospitalisation, or lead to death. The most common methods measuring adherence are post-treatment measures; that is, adherence is usually measured after the treatment has begun. What the authors are proposing in this multidisciplinary study is a technique for analysing the factors that can cause non-adherence before or during medication treatment. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), allows system analysts to determine how combinations of simple faults of a system can propagate to cause a total system failure. Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical algorithm that depends heavily on repeated random sampling to predict the behaviour of a system. In this study, the authors propose the use of Non-Adherence Tree Analysis (NATA), based on the FTA and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, to improve adherence. Firstly, the non-adherence factors of a medication treatment lifecycle are translated into what is referred to as a Non-Adherence Tree (NAT). Secondly, the NAT is coded into a format that is translated into the GoldSim software for performing dynamic system modelling and analysis using Monte Carlo. Finally, the GoldSim model is simulated and analysed to predict the behaviour of the NAT. This study produces a framework for improving adherence by analysing social and non-social adherence barriers. The results reveal that the biggest factor that could contribute to non-adherence to a COVID-19 treatment is a therapy-related factor (the side effects of the medication). This is closely followed by a condition-related factor (asymptomatic nature of the disease) then patient-related factors (forgetfulness and other causes). With this information, clinicians can implement relevant measures and allocate resources appropriately to minimise non-adherence.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ernest E Edifor","author_inst":"Manchester Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Regina Brown","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"Paul Smith","author_inst":"Manchester Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Rick Kossik","author_inst":"GoldSim Technology Group"},{"author_name":"Svetlana Kudryavtseva","author_inst":"Clinical City Hospital named after I.V.

Objectives: Our aim was to describe bronchoscopy findings and analyse co-infection through bronchial aspirate (BA) samples in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ICU admission. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study, analysing the BA samples collected from intubated patients with COVID-19 to diagnose nosocomial respiratory infection. Results: One-hundred and fifty-five consecutive BA samples were collected from 75 patients. Of them, 90 (58%) were positive cultures for different microorganisms, 11 (7.1%) were polymicrobial, and 37 (23.7%) contained resistant microorganisms. There was a statistically significant association between increased days of orotracheal intubation (OTI) and positive BA (18.9 days versus 10.9 days, p<0.01), polymicrobial infection (22.11 versus 13.54, p<0.01) and isolation of resistant microorganisms (18.88 versus 10.94, p<0.01). In 88% of the cases a change in antibiotic treatment was made. Conclusion: Nosocomial respiratory infection in intubated COVID-19 patients seems to be higher than in non-epidemic periods. The longer the intubation period, the greater the probability of co-infection, isolation of resistant microorganisms and polymicrobial infection.

We could recently demonstrate that MCC-IMS of breath is able to identify Influenza-A infected patients. With decreasing Influenza epidemic and upcoming SARS-CoV-2 infections we extended our study to the analysis of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. 51 patients, 23m, 28f, aged 64 +\/- 16 years, were included in this study. Besides RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs all patients underwent MCC-IMS analysis of breath. 16 patients, 7m, 9f, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. There was no difference in gender or age according to the groups. Stepwise canonical discriminant analysis could correctly classify the infected and non- infected subjects in 98% by cross-validation. Afterwards we combined the Influenza-A sub study and the SARS-CoV-2- sub study for a total of 75 patients, 34m, 41f, aged 64.8 +\/- 1.8 years, 14 positive for Influenza-A, 16 positive for SARS-CoV-2, the remaining 44 patients were used as controls. In one patient RT-PCR was highly suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 but inconclusive. There was no imbalance between the groups for age or gender. 97.3% of the patients could be correctly classified to the respective group by discriminant analysis. Even the inconclusive patient could be mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 group applying the discrimination function. Conclusion: MCC-IMS is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and Influenza-A infection in breath. As this method provides exact, fast non-invasive diagnosis it should be further developed for screening of communicable viral diseases.

Methods: We conducted a population cohort study using linked data from adults attending public sector health facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa. We used Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, location and comorbidities to examine the association between HIV and COVID-19 death among (i) public sector 'active patients' (at least 1 health visit in the 3 years before March 2020), (ii) laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases and (iii) hospitalized COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. We calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for COVID-19 comparing HIV positive vs. negative adults using modelled population estimates. Results: Among 3,460,932 public sector patients (16% HIV positive), 22,308 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 625 died. In adjusted analysis, HIV increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]:2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.70; 2.70), with similar risks across strata of viral load and immunosuppression. increased HIV-associated risk of COVID-19 death remained when restricting to COVID-19 cases (aHR:1.70; 95%CI:132; 2.18) or hospitalized cases (aHR:1.45; 95%CI:1.14; 1.84).

Their convalescent plasma could be an inexpensive and widely available treatment for COVID-19. Methods The Convalescent-plasma-for-COVID (ConCOVID) study was a randomized trial comparing convalescent plasma with standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Patients were randomized 1:1 and received 300ml of plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:80. The primary endpoint was day-60 mortality and key secondary endpoints were hospital stay and WHO 8-point disease severity scale improvement on day 15. Results The trial was halted prematurely after 86 patients were enrolled. Although symptomatic for only 10 days (IQR 6-15) at the time of inclusion, 53 of 66 patients tested had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline. A SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test showed neutralizing antibodies in 44 of the 56 (79%) patients tested with median titers comparable to the 115 donors (1:160 vs 1:160, p=0.40). These observations caused concerns about the potential benefit of convalescent plasma in the study population and after discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No difference in mortality (p=0.95), hospital stay (p=0.68) or day-15 disease severity (p=0.58) was observed between plasma treated patients and patients on standard of care. Conclusion Most COVID-19 patients already have high neutralizing antibody titers at hospital admission. Screening for antibodies and prioritizing convalescent plasma to risk groups with recent symptom onset will be key to identify patients that may benefit from convalescent plasma.

Interim clinical trial results suggest that the corticosteroid dexamethasone displays superior 28-day survival in severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation or oxygen. Among 16 patients with plasma IL-6 measurement post-corticosteroid administration, a higher proportion of patients with an IL-6 value over 10 pg\/mL have worse outcomes (i.e. ICU Length of Stay > 15 days or death) when compared to 41 patients treated with non-corticosteroid drugs including antivirals, tocilizumab, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine (p-value = 0.0024). Given this unexpected clinical association between post-corticosteroid IL-6 levels and COVID-19 severity, we hypothesized that the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR or NR3C1) may be coupled to IL-6 expression in specific cell types that govern cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Examining single cell RNA-seq data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of severe COVID-19 patients and nearly 2 million human cells from a pan-tissue scan shows that alveolar macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells co-express both NR3C1 and IL-6. The mechanism of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) agonists mitigating pulmonary and multi-organ inflammation in some COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, may be in part due to their successful antagonism of IL-6 production within lung macrophages and vasculature.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samir Awasthi","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Arjun Puranik","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hurchik","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Vineet Agarwal","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ian Conrad","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Christian Kirkup","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Raman Arunachalam","author_inst":"nference Labs"},{"author_name":"John O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Walter Kremers","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kashyap","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Platform"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William A Faubion","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Peter te Broekhorst","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Francis H.

Although studies have examined the potential association between them, the results remain controversial. This study aims to determine the true effect of ACEI\/ARBs use on the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Methods Five electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, medRxiv preprint server) were retrieved to find eligible studies. Meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between ACEI\/ARBs use and the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Results 22 articles containing 157,328 patients were included. Use of ACEI\/ARBs was not associated with increased risk of infection (Adjusted OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.01, I2=5.8%) or increased severity (Adjusted OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.05, I2=27.6%) of COVID-19. The use of ACEI\/ARBs was associated with lower risk of death from COVID-19 (Adjusted OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44-0.99, I2=57.9%). Similar results of reduced risk of death were also found for ACEI\/ARB use in COVID-19 patients with hypertension (Adjusted OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.17-0.77, I2=0). Conclusion This study provides evidence that ACEI\/ARBs use for COVID-19 patients does not lead to harmful outcomes and may even provide a beneficial role and decrease mortality from COVID-19. Clinicians should not discontinue ACEI\/ARBs for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 if they are already on these agents.

The extent and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is far greater than previous coronaviruses that emerged in the 21st Century. Here, we modeled stability of SARS-CoV-2 on skin, paper currency, and clothing to determine if these surfaces may factor in the fomite transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Skin, currency, and clothing samples were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 under laboratory conditions and incubated at three different temperatures (4C, 22C, and 37C). Stability was evaluated at 0 hours (h), 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 72 h, 96 h, 7 days, and 14 days post-exposure. SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be stable on skin through the duration of the experiment at 4C (14 days). Virus remained stable on skin for at least 96 h at 22C and for at least 8h at 37C. There were minimal differences between the tested currency samples. The virus remained stable on the $1 U.S.A. Bank Note for at least 96 h at 4C while viable virus was not detected on the $20 U.S.A. Bank Note samples beyond 72 h. The virus remained stable on both Bank Notes for at least 8 h at 22C and 4 h at 37C. Clothing samples were similar in stability to the currency with the virus being detected for at least 96 h at 4C and at least 4 h at 22C. No viable virus was detected on clothing samples at 37C after initial exposure. This study confirms the inverse relationship between virus stability and temperature. Furthermore, virus stability on skin demonstrates the need for continued hand hygiene practices to minimize fomite transmission both in the general population as well as workplaces where close contact is common.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Harbourt","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Andrew Haddow","author_inst":"General Dynamics Health Solutions in support of USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Ashley Piper","author_inst":"Oak Ridge Institute of Science and Education"},{"author_name":"Holly Bloomfield","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Brian Kearney","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Gibson","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Tim Minogue","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Hongru Yang","author_inst":"Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Science"},{"author_name":"Zhichun Guo","author_inst":"Massachusetts college of Pharmacy and Health sciences"},{"author_name":"Mengshi Chen","author_inst":"Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chenyu Sun","author_inst":"AMITA Health Saint Joseph Hospital Chicago"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kashyap","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Platform"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William A Faubion","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Peter te Broekhorst","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Francis H.

Design: A systematic review and case-control analysis Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until May 14, 2020 Study selection: All original clinical literature evaluating COVID-19 or SARS-CoV2 were identified and 1:1 historical control of the same study type in the same published journal was matched from the previous year Data extraction: Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-texts and independently assessed methodological quality using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, QUADAS-2 Score, or case series checklist. Results: 9895 titles and abstracts were screened and 686 COVID-19 articles were included in the final analysis in which 380 (55.4%) were case series, 199 (29.0%) were cohort, 63 (9.2%) were diagnostic, 38 (5.5%) were case-control, and 6 (0.9%) were randomized controlled trials. Overall, high quality\/low-bias studies represented less than half of COVID-19 articles - 49.0% of case series, 43.9% of cohort, 31.6% of case-control, and 6.4% of diagnostic studies. We matched 539 control articles to COVID-19 articles from the same journal in the previous year for a final analysis of 1078 articles. The median time to acceptance was 13.0 (IQR, 5.0-25.0) days in COVID-19 articles vs. 110.0 (IQR, 71.0-156.0) days in control articles (p<0.0001). Overall, methodological quality was lower in COVID-19 articles with 220 COVID-19 articles of high quality (41.0%) vs. 392 control articles (73.3%, p<0.0001) with similar results when stratified by study design. In both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression, COVID-19 articles were associated with lower methodological quality (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.33, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Currently published COVID-19 studies were accepted more quickly and were found to be of lower methodological quality than comparative studies published in the same journal. Given the implications of these studies to medical decision making and government policy, greater effort to appropriately weigh the existing evidence in the context of emerging high-quality research is needed.

We investigated whether blood biomarkers measured by high-throughput metabolomics could be predictive of severe pneumonia and COVID-19 hospitalisation years after the blood sampling. Methods: Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics was used to quantify a comprehensive biomarker profile in 105,146 plasma samples collected in the UK Biobank during 2007-2010 (age range 39-70). The biomarkers were tested for association with severe pneumonia (2507 cases, defined as diagnosis in hospital or death record occurring during a median of 8.1-year follow-up) and with severe COVID-19 (195 cases, defined as diagnosis in hospital between mid-March to mid-June 2020). A multi-biomarker score was derived for prediction of severe pneumonia based on half of the study population and validated in the other half. We explored how this biomarker score relates to the risk of severe COVID-19. Findings: The biomarker associations with risk of severe COVID-19 followed an overall pattern similar to associations with risk of severe pneumonia (correlation 0.83). The multi-biomarker score, comprised of 25 blood biomarkers including inflammatory proteins, fatty acids, amino acids and advanced lipid measures, was strongly associated with risk of severe pneumonia (odds ratio 1.67 per standard deviation [95% confidence interval 1.59-1.76]; 3.8-fold risk increase for individuals in upper vs lower quintile). The multi-biomarker score was also associated with risk of severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 1.33 [1.17-1.53]; 2.5-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile) and remained significant when adjusting for body mass index, smoking, and existing respiratory and cardiometabolic diseases. Mimicking the decade lag from blood sampling to COVID-19, severe pneumonia events occurring after 7-11 years associated with the multi-biomarker score to a similar magnitude (odds ratio 1.43 [1.29-1.59]; 2.6-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile) as for severe COVID-19. However, the short-term risk of severe pneumonia events associated to the multi-biomarker score at even 3 times higher magnitude (odds ratio 2.21 [1.95-2.50]; 8.0-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile in analysis of the first 2 years after blood sampling). Interpretation: In decade-old blood samples from the UK Biobank, a biomarker score measured by high-throughput metabolomics is indicative of the risk for severe COVID-19. The molecular signature of biomarker changes reflective of risk for severe COVID-19 is similar to that for severe pneumonia, in particular when accounting for the time lag to the COVID-19 pandemic. The even stronger association of the biomarker score with 2-year risk for severe pneumonia lends support to promising screening possibilities for identifying people at high risk for severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- Nightingale Health UK Biobank Initiative","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Julkunen","author_inst":"Nightingale Health Ltd."},{"author_name":"Anna Cichonska","author_inst":"Nightingale Health Ltd."},{"author_name":"P Eline Slagboom","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter W\u00fcrtz","author_inst":"Nightingale Health Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jonas Chnaiderman","author_inst":"Laboratory of Environmental Virology, Virology Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Rojas","author_inst":"Laboratory of Environmental Virology, Virology Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Sergio Guajardo-Leiva","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Diez","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

Hospitals become rapidly overwhelmed when patients requiring life-saving support outpace available capacities. We here describe methods used by a university hospital to forecast caseloads and time to peak incidence. Methods We developed a set of models to forecast incidence among the hospital catchment population and describe the COVID-19 patient hospital care-path. The first forecast utilized data from antecedent allopatric epidemics and parameterized the care path model according to expert opinion (static model). Once sufficient local data were available, trends for the time dependent effective reproduction number were fitted and the care-path was parameterized using hazards for real patient admission, referrals, and discharge (dynamic model). Results The static model, deployed before the epidemic, exaggerated the bed occupancy (general wards 116 forecasted vs 66 observed, ICU 47 forecasted vs 34 observed) and predicted the peak too late (general ward forecast April 9, observed April 8, ICU forecast April 19, observed April 8). After April 5, the dynamic model could be run daily and precision improved with increasing availability of empirical local data. Conclusions The models provided data-based guidance in the preparation and allocation of critical resources of a university hospital well in advance of the epidemic surge, despite overestimating the service demand. Overestimates should resolve when population contact pattern before and during restrictions can be taken into account, but for now they may provide an acceptable safety margin for preparing during times of uncertainty.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tjibbe Donker","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Fabian B\u00fcrkin","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Martin Wolkewitz","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Christian Haverkamp","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Dominic Christoffel","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Oliver Kappert","author_inst":"Public Health Office, Public Health District Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Thorsten Hammer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Hans-J\u00f6rg Busch","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Johannes Kalbhenn","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Hartmut B\u00fcrkle","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Winfried Kern","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Frederik Wenz","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Hajo Grundmann","author_inst":"UniversityMedical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William A Faubion","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Peter te Broekhorst","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Francis H.

Additional parameters besides {K\/o\\,gamma\/o\\} are needed to better model different rho[t]=dN[t]\/dt shapes.

In the multivariate analyses, age over 50 years, male gender and low-medium socioeconomic status were also positively associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection; age over 50 years was positively associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eugene Merzon","author_inst":"Leumit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel;  Department of Family Medicine, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel;"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Tworowski","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science; Cancer Genomics and BioComputing of Complex Diseases Lab, Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Israel."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Gorohovski","author_inst":"Cancer Genomics and BioComputing of Complex Diseases Lab, Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Israel."},{"author_name":"Shlomo Vinker","author_inst":"Leumit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel; Department of Family Medicine, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel;"},{"author_name":"Avivit Golan Cohen","author_inst":"Leumit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel;  Department of Family Medicine, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel;"},{"author_name":"Ilan Green","author_inst":"Leumit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel;  Department of Family Medicine, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel;"},{"author_name":"Milana Frenkel Morgenstern","author_inst":"Cancer Genomics and BioComputing of Complex Diseases Lab, Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan University, Israel."},{"author_name":"Hans-J\u00f6rg Busch","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Johannes Kalbhenn","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Hartmut B\u00fcrkle","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Winfried Kern","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Frederik Wenz","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Hajo Grundmann","author_inst":"UniversityMedical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William A Faubion","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Peter te Broekhorst","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Francis H.

Considering the limited availability of mechanical ventilators due to high costs increased by global demand, the use of a single ventilator for two or more patients has been encouraged. An experimental model that ventilates two test lungs with a single machine has been designed in order to measure possible asymmetries during parallel circuit ventilation under different lung compliance conditions. This paper reports a first assessment of the risks involved in ventilating two patients with a single machine. Since some volumetric differences are not monitored by the ventilator itself, the main risks involved are distension or alveolar collapse if used in actual patients that have different thoracopulmonary mechanics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastian Ugarte Sr.","author_inst":"Adult Critical Patient Center, INDISA Clinic, Santiago, Chile.

However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequence of primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be significantly higher than RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that ddPCR could be used as a highly sensitive and compatible diagnostic method for viral RNA detection.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Changwoo Park","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Jina Lee","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Zohaib Ul Hassan","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Keun Bon Ku","author_inst":"KRICT"},{"author_name":"Seong Jun Kim","author_inst":"KRICT"},{"author_name":"Hong Gi Kim","author_inst":"KRICT"},{"author_name":"Edmond Changkyun Park","author_inst":"KBSi"},{"author_name":"Gun-Soo Park","author_inst":"KFRI"},{"author_name":"Daeui Park","author_inst":"KIT"},{"author_name":"Seung-Hwa Baek","author_inst":"KIT"},{"author_name":"Dongju Park","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Jihye Lee","author_inst":"IPK"},{"author_name":"Sangeun Jeon","author_inst":"IPK"},{"author_name":"Seungtaek Kim","author_inst":"IPK"},{"author_name":"Chang-Seop Lee","author_inst":"JBNU"},{"author_name":"Hee Min Yoo","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Seil Kim","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Peter te Broekhorst","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Francis H.

To identify possible antibody binding sites not shielded by glycans, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for vaccine development.

However, existing CRISPR-based assays for COVID-19 have not considered viral genome mutations and RNA editing in human cells. Here, we present the VaNGuard (Variant Nucleotide Guard) test that is not only specific and sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, but can also detect the virus when its genome or transcriptome has evolved or has been edited by deaminases in infected human cells. We show that an engineered AsCas12a enzyme is more tolerant of mismatches than wildtype LbCas12a and that multiplexed Cas12a targeting can overcome the presence of single nucleotide variations.

We established a translational approach combining home blood sampling by finger-pricking with multiplexed serology to assess the exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a general population. The developed procedure determines the immune response in multiplexed assays against several spike (S, here denoted SPK), receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (NCP) proteins in eluates from dried capillary blood. The seroprevalence was then determined in two study sets by mailing 1000 blood sampling kits to random households in urban Stockholm during early and late April 2020, respectively. After receiving 55% (1097\/2000) of the cards back within three weeks, 80% (878\/1097) were suitable for the analyses of IgG and IgM titers. The data revealed diverse pattern of immune response, thus seroprevalence was dependent on the antigen, immunoglobulin class, stringency to include different antigens, as well as the required analytical performance. Applying unsupervised dimensionality reduction to the combined IgG and IgM data, 4.4% (19\/435; 95% CI: 2.4%-6.3%) and 6.3% (28\/443; 95% CI: 4.1%-8.6%) of the samples clustered with convalescent controls. Using overlapping scores from at least two SPK antigens, prevalence rates reached 10.1% (44\/435; 95% CI: 7.3%-12.9%) in study set 1 and 10.8% (48\/443; 95% CI: 7.9%-13.7%). Measuring the immune response against several SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a multiplexed workflow can provide valuable insights about the serological diversity and improve the certainty of the classification. Combining such assays with home-sampling of blood presents a viable strategy for individual-level diagnostics and towards an unbiased assessment of the seroprevalence in a population and may serve to improve our understanding about the diversity of COVID-19 etiology.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niclas Roxhed","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Annika Bendes","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Matilda Dale","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Mattsson","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Leo Hanke","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tea Dodig-Crnkovic","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Murray Christian","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Birthe Meineke","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Simon Elsasser","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Juni Andrell","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Haverall","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Carina Eklund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Joakim Dillner","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Olof Beck","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Cecilia E Thomas","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Mun-Gwan Hong","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Claudia Fredolini","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jochen M Schwenk","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Peter D.
