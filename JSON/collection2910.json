Drug repurposing screening is regarded as one of the most practical and rapid approaches for the discovery of such therapeutics. The 3C like protease (3CLpro), or main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a valid drug target as it is a specific viral enzyme and plays an essential role in viral replication. We performed a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) of 10,755 compounds consisting of approved and investigational drugs, and bioactive compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay. Twenty-three small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro have been identified with IC50s ranging from 0.26 to 28.85 M. Walrycin B (IC50 = 0.26 {micro}M), Hydroxocobalamin (IC50 = 3.29 {micro}M), Suramin sodium (IC50 = 6.5 {micro}M), Z-DEVD-FMK (IC50 = 6.81 {micro}M), LLL-12 (IC50 = 9.84 {micro}M), and Z-FA-FMK (IC50 = 11.39 {micro}M) are the most potent 3CLpro inhibitors. The activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was confirmed in 7 of 23 compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. The results demonstrated a set of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors that may have potential for further clinical evaluation as part of drug combination therapies to treating COVID-19 patients, and as starting points for chemistry optimization for new drug development.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Zhu","author_inst":"NIH\/NCATS"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20850, USA"},{"author_name":"Catherine Z.

As fumigation of vinegar at low concentration (0.34%) ameliorated the symptoms of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested in vitro the potential antiviral activity of vinegar and of its active component, acetic acid. We here demonstrate that both vinegar and acetic acid indeed strongly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero cells. Furthermore, vinegar treatment caused a 90% inhibition of the infectious titer when directly applied to a nasopharyngeal swab transfer medium of a COVID-19 patient. These effects were potentiated if conduced at a temperature of 45 {degrees}C vs. 37 {degrees}C, a condition that is transiently generated in the upper respiratory tract during fumigation. Our findings are consistent and extend the results of studies performed in the early and mid-20th century on the disinfectant capacity of organic acids and can provide an affordable home-made aid to prevent or contain SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isabel Pagani","author_inst":"Viral Pathogenesis and Biosafety Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ghezzi","author_inst":"Viral Pathogenesis and Biosafety Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, School of Medicine, Milano and Laboratory of Microbiology and Virology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano Ita"},{"author_name":"Guido Poli","author_inst":"Viral Pathogenesis and Biosafety Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, School of Medicine, Milano, Ital"},{"author_name":"Mario Bussi","author_inst":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, School of Medicine, Milano and Division of Head and Neck Department, Otorhinolaryngology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele  Scientif"},{"author_name":"Luca Pianta","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, ASST, Cremona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Matteo Trimarchi","author_inst":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, School of Medicine, Milano and Division of Head and Neck Department, Otorhinolaryngology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientifi"},{"author_name":"Elisa Vicenzi","author_inst":"Viral Pathogenesis and Biosafety Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Samuel G.

Mean age (SD) was 35.8(12.0) years, 88.9% were male and 8.7% were Qatari nationals. Overall, 83.6% had no concomitant comorbidity, and 3.0% had 3 or more comorbidities. The overwhelming majority (90.9%) were asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms, with 2.0% having severe or critical illness. Presence of hypertension or diabetes were associated with a higher risk of severe or critical illness. Seven deaths were observed during the time interval studied. The epidemiologic curve indicated two distinct patterns of infection, a larger cluster among expatriate craft and manual workers, and a smaller one among Qatari nationals returning from abroad during the epidemic. Conclusion COVID-19 infections in Qatar started in two distinct clusters, but then became more widespread in the population through community transmission. Infections were mostly asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms and associated with very low mortality. Severe\/critical illness was associated with presence of hypertension or diabetes.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanan M Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu Raddad","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Abdul-Badi Abou-Samra","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Zaina Al Kanaani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Abdullatif Al Khal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Einas Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Salih Al Marri","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Muna Al Masalmani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hamad Eid Al Romaihi","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Sheikh M Al Thani","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ali N Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Robert Owen","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bertollini","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154260","rel_title":"Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19: a nationwide registry","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154260","rel_abs":"Background: The clinical description of the neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients is still underway. This study aims to provide an overview of the spectrum, characteristics and outcomes of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted a nationwide, multicentric, retrospective study during the French COVID-19 epidemic in March-April 2020. All COVID-19 patients with de novo neurological manifestations were eligible. Results: We included 222 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations from 46 centers throughout the country. Median age was 65 years (IQR 53-72), and 136 patients (61.3%) were male. COVID-19 was severe or critical in almost half of the patients (102, 45.2%). The most common neurological diseases were COVID-19 associated encephalopathy (67\/222, 30.2%), acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (57\/222, 25.7%), encephalitis (21\/222, 9.5%), and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (15\/222, 6.8%). Neurological manifestations appeared after first COVID-19 symptoms with a median (IQR) delay of 6 (3-8) days in COVID-19 associated encephalopathy, 7 (5-10) days in encephalitis, 12 (7-18) days in acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome and 18 (15-28) days in Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Brain imaging was performed in 192 patients (86.5%), including 157 MRI (70.7%). Brain MRI of encephalitis patients showed heterogeneous acute non vascular lesion in 14\/21 patients (66.7%) with associated small ischemic lesion or microhemorrhages in 4 patients. Among patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome, 13\/57 (22.8%) had multi territory ischemic strokes, with large vessel thrombosis in 16\/57 (28.1%). Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed in 97 patients (43.7%), with pleocytosis in 18 patients (18.6%). A SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed in 75 patients and was positive only in 2 encephalitis patients. Among patients with encephalitis, ten out of 21 (47.6%) fully recovered, 3 of whom received corticosteroids (CS). Less common neurological manifestations included isolated seizure (8\/222, 3.6%), critical illness neuropathy (8\/222, 3.6%), transient alteration of consciousness (5\/222, 2.3%), intracranial hemorrhage (5\/222, 2.3%), acute benign lymphocytic meningitis (3\/222, 1.4%), cranial neuropathy (3\/222, 1.4%), single acute demyelinating lesion (2\/222, 0.9%), Tapia syndrome (2\/222, 0.9%), cerebral venous thrombosis (1\/222, 0.5%), sudden paraparesis (1\/222, 0.5%), generalized myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia (1\/222, 0.5%), bilateral fibular palsy (1\/222, 0.5%) and isolated neurological symptoms (headache, anosmia, dizziness, sensitive or auditive symptoms, hiccups, 15\/222, 6.8%). The median (IQR) follow-up of the 222 patients was 24 (17-34) days with a high short-term mortality rate (28\/222, 12.6%). Conclusion: Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 mainly included CAE, AICS, encephalitis and GBS. Clinical spectrum and outcomes were broad and heterogeneous, suggesting different underlying pathogenic processes.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elodie Meppiel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Nathan Peiffer-Smadja","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Maury","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Imen Bekri","author_inst":"Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, F-78150 Le Chesnay, France"},{"author_name":"Cecile Delorme","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Assistance-Publique Hopitaux de Paris, F-75013 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Virginie Desestret","author_inst":"Department of Neuro-cognition and Neuro-ophthalmology, Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Lucas Gorza","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Hautecloque-Raysz","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Sophie Landre","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154161","rel_title":"Projecting the second outbreaks for global COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154161","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is now in an epidemic phase, with a second outbreak likely to appear at any time. The intensity and timing of a second outbreak is a common concern worldwide. In this study, we made scenario projections of the potential second outbreak of COVID-19 using a statistical-epidemiology model, which considers both the impact of seasonal changes in meteorological elements and human social behaviors such as protests and city unblocking. Recent street protests in the United States and other countries are identified as a hidden trigger and amplifier of the second outbreak. The scale and intensity of subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S. cities where the epidemic is under initial control are projected to be much greater than those of the first outbreak. For countries without reported protests, lifting the COVID-19 related restrictions prematurely would accelerate the spread of the disease and place mounting pressure on the local medical system that is already overloaded. We anticipate these projections will support public health planning and policymaking by governments and international organizations.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianping Huang","author_inst":"Collaborative Innovation Center for Western Ecological Safety"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Liu","author_inst":"Collaborative Innovation Center for Western Ecological Safety"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Collaborative Innovation Center for Western Ecological Safety"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Huang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chuwei Liu","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danfeng Wang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154294","rel_title":"The impact of host resistance on cumulative mortality and the threshold of herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154294","rel_abs":"The risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19 is not uniformly distributed across all age classes, with the bulk of deaths occurring among older ages and those with comorbidities. Evidence is also mounting that some individuals have pre-existing immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 which may confer resistance to infection. We present a general mathematical framework which can be used to systematically explore the impact of variation in resistance to severe disease and infection by SARS-CoV-2 on its epidemiology. We find that the herd immunity threshold (HIT) can be lowered by the existence of a fraction of the population who are unable to transmit the virus, whether they are effectively segregated from the general population or mix randomly. These results help to explain the wide variation observed globally in seroprevalence and cumulative deaths and raise the possibility that the proportion exposed may have already exceeded HIT in certain regions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Lourenco","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Francesco Pinotti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Craig Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Huang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chuwei Liu","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danfeng Wang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154823","rel_title":"SARS-COV-2 THREE FORCING SEASONALITIES: POLICIES, ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SPACES","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154823","rel_abs":"This research investigated if pandemic of SARS-COV-2 follows the Earth seasonality {varepsilon} comparing countries cumulative daily new infections incidence over Earth periodic time of interest for north and south hemisphere.

Confidence to manage the current situation, wishful thinking and empathetic responding directly predicted compliance to social distancing ({beta}=-0.31, p<0.001; {beta}=0.35, p=0.015; {beta}=0.33, p<0.001 respectively) and personal hygiene measures ({beta}=-0.16, p<0.001; {beta}=0.21, p<0.001; {beta}=0.16, p<0.001 respectively). Gender, geographical location, and clinical experience were the only three demographic variables having direct and\/or indirect effects on social distancing and personal hygiene measures. The final model constructed demonstrated a very good fit to the data (Chi-square X2=27.27, df=17, P=0.044; X2\/df=1.61; GFI=0.998, CFI=0.997, TLI=0.992, RMSEA=0.015). Conclusions: The predictive model constructed in this study is the first one to explore factors associating with the compliance to infection control measures in healthcare students amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings suggest that students who are male, habituate in Hong Kong, have more clinical experience and weak confidence to manage the threat tend to have lower compliance to social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Wishful thinking, contrasting to previous studies, was first found to positively associate with adherence to COVID-19 control measures.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anson Chui Yan Tang","author_inst":"Tung Wah College"},{"author_name":"Enid Wai Yung Kwong","author_inst":"Putian College"},{"author_name":"Liangying Chen","author_inst":"Putian College"},{"author_name":"Winnie Lai Sheung Cheng","author_inst":"Tung Wah College"},{"author_name":"John Ermisch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Melinda Mills","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Beam Dowd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danfeng Wang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155036","rel_title":"Are the upper bounds for new SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany useful?","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155036","rel_abs":"At the end of 2019, an outbreak of a new coronavirus, called SARS--CoV--2, was reported in China and later in other parts of the world. First infections were reported in Germany by the end of January and on March 16th the federal government announced a partial lockdown in order to mitigate the spread. Since the dynamics of new infections started to slow down, German states started to relax the confinement measures as to the beginning of May. As a fall back option, a limit of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days was introduced for each city or district in Germany. If a district exceeds this limit, measures to control the spread of the virus should be taken. Based on a multi--patch SEAIRD--type model, we will simulate the effect of choosing a specific upper limit for new infections. We investigate, whether the politically motivated bound is low enough to detect new outbreaks at an early stage. Subsequently, we introduce an optimal control problem to tackle the multi--criteria problem of finding a bound for new infections that is low enough to avoid new outbreaks, which might lead to an overload of the health care system, but is large enough to curb the expected economic losses.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wolfgang Bock","author_inst":"Technische Universitaet Kaiserslautern"},{"author_name":"Thomas Goetz","author_inst":"University Koblenz"},{"author_name":"Yashika Jayathunga","author_inst":"University Koblenz"},{"author_name":"Robert Rockenfeller","author_inst":"University Koblenz"},{"author_name":"John Ermisch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Melinda Mills","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Beam Dowd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danfeng Wang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Annie Lannuzel","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Guadeloupe"},{"author_name":"Solene Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Hopital Maison Blanche"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Paul Petitgas","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Francois Sellal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopitaux civils de Colmar"},{"author_name":"Adrien Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"Pierre Tattevin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes"},{"author_name":"Thomas de Broucker","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier de Saint-Denis, Hopital Delafontaine, F-93200 Saint-Denis, France"},{"author_name":"- contributors to the NeuroCOVID registry","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154930","rel_title":"Home-based and remote exercise testing in chronic respiratory disease, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: a rapid review","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154930","rel_abs":"Objectives: To identify exercise tests that are suitable for home-based or remote administration in people with chronic lung disease. Methods: Rapid review of studies that reported home-based or remote administration of an exercise test in people with chronic lung disease, and studies reporting their clinimetric properties.

Exercise tests administered remotely were the 6MWT (2 studies) and step test (1 study). Compared to centre-based testing the 6MWT distance was similar when performed outdoors but shorter when performed at home (2 studies). The STS, TUG and step tests were feasible, reliable (intra-class correlation coefficients >0.80), valid (concurrent and known groups validity) and moderately responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation (medium effect sizes). These tests elicited less desaturation than the 6MWT, and validated methods to prescribe exercise were not reported. Discussion: The STS, step and TUG tests can be performed at home, but do not accurately document desaturation with walking or allow exercise prescription. Patients at risk of desaturation should be prioritised for centre-based exercise testing when this is available.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anne E Holland","author_inst":"Monash University and Alfred Health"},{"author_name":"Carla Malaguti","author_inst":"Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Mariana Hoffman","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Aroub Lahham","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Angela T Burge","author_inst":"Monash University and Alfred Health"},{"author_name":"Leona Dowman","author_inst":"Monash University and Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony K May","author_inst":"Monash University and Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Janet Bondarenko","author_inst":"Alfred Health"},{"author_name":"Marnie Graco","author_inst":"Alfred Health and Institute for Breathing and Sleep"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Tikellis","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Y.T.

Using data collected from health care worker interactions with hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness, we calculated the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 via the airborne route. OBJECTIVES\/METHODS: Healthcare worker interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tracked using a real time location system between March 18 and March 31. A value for q, the transmissibility expressed as quanta per hour, was estimated using a well-established model for airborne transmission. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among tracked HCWs was 2.21% (0.07-4.35). Transmissibility was estimated to be 0.225 quanta per hour, well below other well-characterized airborne pathogens. Simulations demonstrated that risk of infection is substantially reduced with increased ventilation of rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not well transmitted via the airborne route in controlled conditions. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be only opportunistically airborne, with most transmission occurring via droplet methods.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bala Hota","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brian Stein","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Lin","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alex Tomich","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Segreti","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Robert A Weinstein","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony K May","author_inst":"Monash University and Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Janet Bondarenko","author_inst":"Alfred Health"},{"author_name":"Marnie Graco","author_inst":"Alfred Health and Institute for Breathing and Sleep"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Tikellis","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Y.T.

More than 50% of patients with COVID-19 that receive invasive treatment such as mechanical ventilation will die in hospital. Such impacts overwhelm the limited intensive care unit resources and may lead to further deaths given inadequate access to care. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is defined as breathing 100% oxygen at a pressure higher than 1.4 atmosphere absolute (ATA). HBOT is safe, including for lungs, when administered by experienced teams and is routinely administrated for a number of approved indications. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests clinical improvement when hypoxemic COVID-19 patients are treated with HBOT. Objective: We aim to determine the effectiveness of HBOT for improving oxygenation, morbidity, and mortality among hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Methods and analysis: This trial is a sequential Bayesian Parallel-group, individually Randomized, Open, Blinded Endpoint controlled trial. Admitted hypoxemic COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen (without high flow and mechanical ventilation) to maintain a satisfying tissue oxygenation will be eligible to participate. The anticipated sample size of 234 patients is informed by data from a treatment trial of COVID patients recently published. The intervention group will receive one HBOT per day at 2.0 ATA for 75 minutes. Daily HBOT will be administered until either the patient does not require any oxygen supplementation or requires any type of mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygenation until day 28 post-randomization. Patients in the control group will receive the current standard of care treatment (no HBOT). The primary outcome of this trial will be the 7-level COVID ordinal outcomes scale assessed on Day 7 post-randomization. Secondary outcomes will include: (a) clinical outcomes (length of hospital stay, days with oxygen supplementation, oxygen flow values to obtain a saturation by pulse oximetry [&ge;]90%, intensive care admission and length of stay, days on invasive mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygen, sleep quality, fatigue, major thrombotic events, the 7-level COVID ordinal outcomes scale on Day 28; mortality, safety); (b) biological outcomes (plasma inflammatory markers); and (c) health system outcomes (cost of care and cost-effectiveness). Predetermined inclusion\/exclusion criteria have been specified. The analytical approach for the primary outcome will use a Bayesian proportional odds ordinal logistic semiparametric model. The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Bayesian posterior probabilities will be calculated every 20 patients to assess accumulating evidence for benefit or harm. A planned subgroup analysis will be performed for pre-specified variables known to impact COVID-19 prognosis and\/or HBOT (biologic sex and age). Discussion: Based on the mortality rate and substantial burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare system, it is imperative that solutions be found. HBOT is a non-invasive and low-risk intervention when contraindications are respected. The established safety and relatively low cost of providing HBOT along with its potential to improve the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients make this intervention worth studying, despite the current limited number of HBOT centres. If this trial finds that HBOT significantly improves outcome and prevents further deterioration leading to critical care for severe COVID-19 patients, practice will change internationally. If no benefit is found from the intervention, then the current standard of care (no HBOT) will be supported by level I evidence.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sylvain Boet","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rita Katznelson","author_inst":"Toronto General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lana A.

The aim of this study was to describe national, 60-day all-cause mortality associated with COVID-19, and to identify risk factors associated with admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Methods This was a retrospective cohort study including the first consecutive 5000 patients with COVID-19 in Qatar who completed 60 days of follow up by June 17, 2020. Outcomes included all-cause mortality at 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, and risk factors for admission to ICU. Results Included patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 28 and April 17, 2020. The majority (4436, 88.7%) were males and the median age was 35 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28-43]. By 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, 14 patients (0.28%) had died, 10 (0.2%) were still in hospital, and two (0.04%) were still in ICU. Fatal COVID-19 cases had a median age of 59.5 years (IQR 55.8-68), and were mostly males (13, 92.9%). All included pregnant women (26, 0.5%), children (131, 2.6%), and healthcare workers (135, 2.7%) were alive and not hospitalized at the end of follow up. A total of 1424 patients (28.5%) required hospitalization, out of which 108 (7.6%) were admitted to ICU. Most frequent co-morbidities in hospitalized adults were diabetes (23.2%), and hypertension (20.7%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.041, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022-1.061 per year increase; P <0.001], male sex (aOR 4.375, 95% CI 1.964-9.744; P <0.001), diabetes (aOR 1.698, 95% CI 1.050-2.746; P 0.031), chronic kidney disease (aOR 3.590, 95% CI 1.596-8.079, P 0.002), and higher BMI (aOR 1.067, 95% CI 1.027-1.108 per unit increase; P 0.001), were all independently associated with increased risk of ICU admission. Conclusions In a relatively younger national cohort with a low co-morbidity burden, COVID-19 was associated with low all-cause mortality. Independent risk factors for ICU admission included older age, male sex, higher BMI, and co-existing diabetes or chronic kidney disease.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali S.

This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions. Method We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a five-week period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population Result Of the 1,070 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 496 critically ill patients were hospitalized and included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (53%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the 'obese' range. 97% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (84%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (57%) and chronic kidney disease (24%). Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease who received hemodialysis were found to have significantly lower mortality, then those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis (11%, OR, 0.35, CI, 0.17 - 0.69 P=0.001). Age >60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD\/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg\/L), LDH (551, 638 U\/L), glucose (182, 163 mg\/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng\/mL), and neutrophil \/ lymphocyte ratio (8.5, 10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 hrs. Of the 496 inpatients, 48% died, one third of patients died within the first three days of admission. 54\/488 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 87% died and of the remaining patients, 32% died. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors\/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in African-American patients.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raavi Gupta","author_inst":"State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Raag Agrawal","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zaheer Bukhari","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Absia Jabbar","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Donghai Wang","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Diks","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Alshal","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dokpe Yvonne Emechebe","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.

We aim to estimate time-dependent transmissibility of COVID-19 for India using a reproducible framework. Methods: Daily COVID-19 case incidence time series for India and its states were obtained from https:\/\/api.covid19india.org\/ and pre-processed. The Bayesian approach was adopted to quantify transmissibility at a given location and time, as indicated by the instantaneous reproduction number (Reff). The analysis was carried out in R version 4.0.2 using -EpiEstim_2.2-3- package. Serial interval distribution was estimated using -uncertain_si- algorithm with inputs of mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of mean serial intervals as 5.1, 1.2, 3.9 and 7.5 days respectively; and mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of standard deviations of the serial interval as 3.7, 0.9, 2.3, and 4.7 respectively with 100 simulations and moving average of seven days. Results. A total of 9,07,544 cumulative incident cases till July 13th, 2020 were analysed. Daily COVID-19 incidence in the country was seen on the rise; however, transmissibility showed a decline from the initial phases of COVID-19 pandemic in India. The maximum Reff reached at the national level during the study period was 2.57 (sliding week ending April 4th, 2020). Reff on July 13th, 2020 for India was 1.16 with a range from 0.59 to 2.98 across various states\/UTs. Conclusion. Reff provides critical feedback for assessment of transmissibility of COVID-19 and thus is a potential dynamic decision support tool for on-ground public health decision making","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gurpreet Singh","author_inst":"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum"},{"author_name":"Seema Patrikar","author_inst":"Armed Forces Medical College, Pune."},{"author_name":"PS Sarma","author_inst":"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum."},{"author_name":"Biju Soman","author_inst":"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum."},{"author_name":"Donghai Wang","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Diks","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Alshal","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dokpe Yvonne Emechebe","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.

The model can be used to explain slower approaching herd immunity in Sweden, than it was predicted by a variety of other mathematical models; see graphs Fig. 2. The hierarchic structure of social clusters is mathematically modeled with ultrametric spaces having treelike geometry. To simplify mathematics, we consider homogeneous trees with p-branches leaving each vertex. Such trees are endowed with algebraic structure, the p-adic number fields. We apply theory of the p-adic diffusion equation to describe coronavirus' spread in hierarchically clustered population. This equation has applications to statistical physics and microbiology for modeling dynamics on energy landscapes. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy's levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing barriers. This structure matches with mild regulations in Sweden. The virus spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This behavior matches with the covid-19 epidemic, with its cluster spreading structure. Our model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. We present socio-medical specialties of the covid-19 epidemic supporting our purely diffusional model.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrei Khrennikov","author_inst":"Linnaeus University"},{"author_name":"Seema Patrikar","author_inst":"Armed Forces Medical College, Pune."},{"author_name":"PS Sarma","author_inst":"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum."},{"author_name":"Biju Soman","author_inst":"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum."},{"author_name":"Donghai Wang","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Diks","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Alshal","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dokpe Yvonne Emechebe","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.

Strict lockdown policies were necessary to contain the first outbreak wave and prevent the Italian healthcare system from being overwhelmed by patients requiring intensive care. After the progressive reopening, predicting how the epidemic situation will evolve is urgent and fundamental to control any future outbreak and prevent a second wave. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to repeatedly calibrate the SIDARTHE model with data up to June 24th. The computed parameter distributions allow us to robustly analyse how the epidemic situation evolved and outline possible future scenarios. Assuming a seasonal regime for COVID-19, we tested different lockdown policies.

Correcting for possible confounders, we estimated their causal effects on reported case numbers. To this end, we used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as a graphical representation of the hypothesized causal effects of the aforementioned determinants on new reported cases of COVID-19. Based on this, we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors. We collected data for Germany from publicly available sources (e.g. Robert Koch Institute, Germany's National Meteorological Service, Google) for 401 German districts over the period of 15 February to 8 July 2020, and estimated total causal effects based on our DAG analysis by negative binomial regression. Our analysis revealed favorable causal effects of increasing temperature, increased public mobility for essential shopping (grocery and pharmacy), and awareness measured by COVID-19 burden, all of them reducing the outcome of newly reported COVID-19 cases. Conversely, we saw adverse effects of public mobility in retail and recreational areas, awareness measured by searches for \"corona\" in Google, and higher rainfall, leading to an increase in new COVID-19 cases. This comprehensive causal analysis of a variety of determinants affecting COVID-19 progression gives strong evidence for the driving forces of mobility, public awareness, and temperature, whose implications need to be taken into account for future decisions regarding pandemic management.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edgar Steiger","author_inst":"Central Research Institute of Ambulatory Health Care in Germany (Zi)"},{"author_name":"Tobias Mussgnug","author_inst":"Central Research Institute of Ambulatory Health Care in Germany (Zi)"},{"author_name":"Lars Eric Kroll","author_inst":"Central Research Institute of Ambulatory Health Care in Germany (Zi)"},{"author_name":"Giulia Giordano","author_inst":"Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Trento"},{"author_name":"Enrico Domenici","author_inst":"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)"},{"author_name":"Luca Marchetti","author_inst":"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Alshal","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dokpe Yvonne Emechebe","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.

We determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 using a large dataset (N=21,000-157,000) from the Brazilian Sistema de Informacao de Vigilancia Epidemiologica da Gripe database. A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2-17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of 15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalised log-normal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting.

In this work, we go deep in this subject by presenting an innovative compartmental model, that explicitly introduces the number of active cases, and employing it as a conceptual tool to explore the possible fates of the dispersion of SARS-COV-2 in the Mexican context. We incorporated the impact of starting, inattention, and end of restrictive social policies on the time evolution of the pandemics via time-in-run corrections to the infection rates. The magnitude and impact on the epidemic due to post-social restrictive policies are also studied.

An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions, during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we develop here, in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is of general interest in studying spatial dynamics of epidemics.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Olivier Bonnefon","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Virgile Baudrot","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Samuel Soubeyrand","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Henri Berestycki","author_inst":"EHESS"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Axel Gandy","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.

As of mid-June 2020, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with more than 7.7 million confirmed cases and more than 400,000 deaths. The impacts are substantial particularly in developing and densely populated countries like Bangladesh with inadequate health care facilities, where COVID-19 cases are currently surging. While early detection and isolation were identified as important non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures for containing the disease spread, this may not be pragmatically implementable in developing countries primarily due to social and economic reasons (i.e. poor education, less public awareness, massive unemployment). To shed light on COVID-19 transmission dynamics and impacts of NPI scenarios, e.g. social distancing, this study conducted emerging pattern analysis using the space-time scan statistic at district and thana (i.e. a sub-district or 'upazila' with at least one police station) levels in Bangladesh and its capital Dhaka city, respectively. We found that the central and south eastern regions in Bangladesh are currently exhibiting a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Dhaka megacity remains as the highest risk \"active\" cluster since early April. The space-time progression of COVID-19 infection, when validated against the chronicle of government press releases and newspaper reports, suggests that Bangladesh have experienced a community level transmission at the early phase (i.e., March, 2020) primarily introduced by Bangladeshi citizens returning from coronavirus-affected countries in the Europe and the Middle East. A linkage is evident between the violation of NPIs and post-incubation period emergence of new clusters with elevated exposure risk around Bangladesh. This study provides novel insights into the space-time patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics and recommends pragmatic NPI implementation for reducing disease transmission and minimizing impacts in a resource-scarce country with Bangladesh as a case-study example.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arif Masrur","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Manzhu Yu","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Wei Luo","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ashraf Dewan","author_inst":"Curtin University"},{"author_name":"Henri Berestycki","author_inst":"EHESS"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Axel Gandy","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.

However, these interventions have had enormous societal and economic costs. Here we explore the feasibility of an alternative control strategy, test-trace-quarantine: routine testing of primarily symptomatic individuals, tracing and testing their known contacts, and placing their contacts in quarantine. We performed this analysis using Covasim, an open-source agent-based model, which was calibrated to detailed demographic, mobility, and epidemiological data for the Seattle region from January through May. With current levels of mask use and schools remaining closed, we predict that high but achievable levels of testing and tracing are sufficient to maintain epidemic control even under a return to full workplace and community mobility. The easing of mobility restrictions in June and subsequent scale-up of testing and tracing programs provided real-world validation of our predictions. Although we show that test-trace-quarantine can control the epidemic in both theory and practice, its success is contingent on high testing and tracing rates, high quarantine compliance, relatively short testing and tracing delays, and moderate to high mask use. Thus, in order to control transmission with a return to high mobility, strong performance in all aspects of the program is required.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cliff C Kerr","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Dina Mistry","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Robyn M Stuart","author_inst":"Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Katherine Rosenfeld","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Gregory R Hart","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rafael C Nunez","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Jamie A Cohen","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Romesh G Abeysuriya","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Lauren George","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Brittany Hagedorn","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Michal Jastrzebski","author_inst":"GitHub, Inc."},{"author_name":"Meaghan Fagalde","author_inst":"Public Health - Seattle and King County"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health - Seattle and King County"},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Klein","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Sulieman Abu Jarir","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Shiema Abdalla","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kris Choda","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Venkateswara R.

To compare the patient population, common complaints, and physician recommendations in direct-to-consumer chat-based consults, before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data sources. Data on patient characteristics, patient complaints, and physician recommendations from 36,864 chat-based telemedicine consults with physicians in an online-clinic by patients from across the United States between April 2019 and April 2020. Study Design. We perform a retrospective analysis comparing patient characteristics, visit characteristics, and physician recommendation before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. We examine patient age and gender, visit time, patient chief complains, and physician medical recommendation (including prescription drugs, reassurance, and referrals). Principal Findings. Before March 2020, most patients were female (75 percent) and 18-44 years old (89 percent). Common complaints such as abdominal pain, dysuria, or sore throat suggested minor acute conditions. Most cases (67 percent) were resolved remotely, mainly via prescriptions; a minority were referred. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 emergency has led to a sharp (fourfold) increase in case volume, including more males (from 25 to 29 percent), patients aged 45 and older (from 11 to 17 percent), and more cases involving mental health complaints and complaints related to COVID-19. Across all symptoms, significantly more cases (78 percent) have been resolved remotely. Conclusions. The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has been associated with a sharp increase in the use of chat-based telemedicine services, including by new patient demographics, an increase in both COVID-19 and mental health complains, and an increase in remote case resolutions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Zeltzer","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Alina Vodonos Zilberg","author_inst":"K Health, Tel Aviv"},{"author_name":"Yehuda Edo Paz","author_inst":"K Health, New York"},{"author_name":"Roy Malka","author_inst":"K Health, Tel Aviv"},{"author_name":"Gregory R Hart","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rafael C Nunez","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Jamie A Cohen","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Romesh G Abeysuriya","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Lauren George","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Brittany Hagedorn","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Michal Jastrzebski","author_inst":"GitHub, Inc."},{"author_name":"Meaghan Fagalde","author_inst":"Public Health - Seattle and King County"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health - Seattle and King County"},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Klein","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Sulieman Abu Jarir","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Shiema Abdalla","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kris Choda","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Venkateswara R.

Methods: We anonymously surveyed 212 undergraduate and 134 graduate students in the College of Public Health, and 94 graduate students in the College of Education in late June, 2020. We asked them Likert style questions regarding their comfort returning to campus and their preferred learning strategies once back. We compared Strongly agree\/Agree with Neutral\/Disagree\/Strongly disagree using a chi-square test. Results: Graduate students were significantly less likely to look forward to being on campus (38.3% doctoral vs 40.6% master's vs 77.7% undergraduate, p < 0.001), more likely to perceive themselves as high risk (43.3% doctoral vs 40.0% masters vs 17.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001), and were more likely to prefer all classwork online (66.7% doctoral vs 44.6% masters vs 20.8% undergraduate, p < 0.001).

However, using these models in medical computer vision tasks suffers from several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations for COVID-19 detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution benefits from (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance compared to individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages to validate our claims; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods. We observe that: (i) ensemble approaches improved classification and localization performance; and, (ii) inter-reader variability and performance level assessment helped guide algorithm design and parameter optimization.
