Recent studies have found that the pathogen of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, shares the same cell receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) with SARS-CoV. The pathological investigation of COVID-19 death showed that the lung had the characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell-type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy and fibrotic lungs, as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts, using published single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that ACE2 expression in fibrotic lungs mainly locates in arterial vascular cells, which might provide the route for bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2. The failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ACE2-expressing cardiomyocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 might attack cardiomyocytes through the bloodstream in patients with heart failure. Moreover, ACE2 was highly expressed in cells infected by RSV or MERS-CoV and in mice treated by LPS. Our findings indicate that patients with pulmonary fibrosis, heart failure, and virus infection have a higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 might attack other organs by getting into the bloodstream. This work provides new insights into SARS-CoV-2 blood entry and heart injury and might propose a therapeutic strategy to prevent patients from developing severe complications.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jieyu Guo","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangxiang Wei","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qinhan Li","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Liliang Li","author_inst":"school of basic medical sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhaohua Yang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yu Shi","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yue Qin","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xinhong Wang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiuling Zhi","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Meng","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20046375","rel_title":"Modeling the COVID-19 outbreaks and the effectiveness of the containment measures adopted across countries","rel_date":"2020-04-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20046375","rel_abs":"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak, originally started in China, a global pandemic. Since then, the outbreak has indeed spread across all continents, threatening the public health of numerous countries. Although the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is relatively low when optimal level of healthcare is granted to the patients, the high percentage of severe cases developing severe pneumonia and thus requiring respiratory support is worryingly high, and could lead to a rapid saturation of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). To overcome this risk, most countries enacted COVID-19 containment measures. In this study, we use a Bayesian SEIR epidemiological model to perform a parametric regression over the COVID-19 outbreaks data in China, Italy, Belgium, and Spain, and estimate the effect of the containment measures on the basic reproduction ratio R_0. We find that the effect of these measures is detectable, but tends to be gradual, and that a progressive strengthening of these measures usually reduces the R_0 below 1, granting a decay of the outbreak. We also discuss the biases and inconsistencies present in the publicly available data on COVID-19 cases, providing an estimate for the actual number of cases in Italy on March 12, 2020. Lastly, despite the data and model's limitations, we argue that the idea of \"flattening the curve\" to reach herd immunity is likely to be unfeasible.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward De Brouwer","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Daniele Raimondi","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Yves Moreau","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Liliang Li","author_inst":"school of basic medical sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhaohua Yang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yu Shi","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yue Qin","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xinhong Wang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiuling Zhi","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Meng","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20047852","rel_title":"Epigenetic dysregulation of ACE2 and interferon-regulated genes might suggest increased COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in lupus patients","rel_date":"2020-04-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20047852","rel_abs":"Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 can result in severe respiratory complications and death. Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF{kappa}B, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amr H Sawalha","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Ming Zhao","author_inst":"Central South University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Coit","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Qianjin Lu","author_inst":"Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhaohua Yang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yu Shi","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yue Qin","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xinhong Wang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiuling Zhi","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Meng","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"rheumatology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.020966","rel_title":"Deducing the N- and O- glycosylation profile of the spike protein of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.020966","rel_abs":"The current emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 demands the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent rapid progress of mortalities. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O-glycosylation is strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research towards the development of a suitable vaccine candidate.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asif Shajahan","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Nitin T Supekar","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Anne S Gleinich","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Parastoo Azadi","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Zhaohua Yang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yu Shi","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yue Qin","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xinhong Wang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiuling Zhi","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Meng","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.019299","rel_title":"Structural basis to design multi-epitope vaccines against Novel Coronavirus 19 (COVID19) infection, the ongoing pandemic emergency: an in silico approach","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.019299","rel_abs":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID19 \/ Wuhan coronavirus), officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus.

The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane fusion. Here, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed two B56-binding LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The motif in S1 subunit is absent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Phosphatases and kinases are major players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses target PP2A in order to manipulate hosts antiviral responses. Recent researches have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained host inflammation. Therefore, by controlling acute inflammation, it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight COVID-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and the PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a target for the discovery and\/or development of a bioactive ligand inhibitor for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, a small molecule called Artepillin C (ArtC), a main compound in Brazilian honeybee green propolis, mimics the side chains of LxxLxE motif. Importantly, ArtC is known, among other effects, to have anti-inflammatory activity that makes it an excellent candidate for future clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Halim Maaroufi","author_inst":"Institut de Biologie Int\u00e9grative et des Syst\u00e8mes (IBIS) Universit\u00e9 Laval, Quebec, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sonia Verma","author_inst":"National Institute of Malaria Research, India"},{"author_name":"Mohit Kamthania","author_inst":"Institute of Applied Medicines and Research, India"},{"author_name":"Rupinder Kaur","author_inst":"Guru Nanak Dev University, India"},{"author_name":"Ruchi Kiran Badyal","author_inst":"Mangalayatan University, India"},{"author_name":"Ajay Kumar Saxena","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University, India"},{"author_name":"Ho-Joon Shin","author_inst":"Ajou University, South Korea"},{"author_name":"Michael Kolbe","author_inst":"Helmholzt-Center for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kailash Pandey","author_inst":"National Institute of Malaria Research, India"},{"author_name":"Xiuling Zhi","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Meng","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.017459","rel_title":"In silico approach for designing of a multi-epitope based vaccine against novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2)","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.017459","rel_abs":"A novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) has now become a global pandemic.

Suitable tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was generated using 3Dpro of SCRATCH suite, refined with GalaxyRefine, and validated with ProSA, PROCHECK, and ERRAT server. Finally, molecular docking studies were performed to ensure a favorable binding affinity between the vaccine construct and TLR3 receptor.

The anticipated spread of the virus requires an urgent appraisal of the capacity of US healthcare services and the identification of states most vulnerable to exceeding their capacity Methods: In the American Hospital Association survey for 2018, a database of US community hospitals, we identified total inpatient beds, adult intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and airborne isolation rooms across all hospitals in each state of continental US. The burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations was estimated based on a median hospitalization duration of 12 days and was evaluated for a 30-day reporting period. Results: At 5155 US community hospitals across 48 states in the contiguous US and Washington DC, there were a total of 788,032 inpatient beds, 68,280 adult ICU beds, and 44,222 isolation rooms. The median daily bed occupancy was 62.8% (IQR 58.1%, 66.6%) across states. Nationally, for every 10,000 individuals, there are 24.2 inpatient beds, 2.8 adult ICU beds, and 1.4 isolation beds. There is a 3-fold variation in the number of inpatient beds available across the US, ranging from 16.4 per 10,000 in Oregon to 47 per 10,000 in South Dakota. There was also a similar 3-fold variation in available or non-occupied beds, ranging from 4.7 per 10,000 in Connecticut through 18.3 per 10,000 in North Dakota. The availability of ICU beds is low nationally, ranging from 1.4 per 10,000 in Nevada to 4.7 per 10000 in Washington DC. Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in a median 0.2% (IQR 0.2 %, 0.3%) of state population, or 1.4% of state's older adults (1.0%, 1.9%) will require all non-occupied beds. Further, a median 0.6% (0.5%, 0.8%) of state population, or 3.9% (3.1%, 4.6%) of older individuals would require 100% of inpatient beds. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to overwhelm the limited number of inpatient and ICU beds for the US population. Hospitals in half of US states would exceed capacity if less than 0.2% of the state population requires hospitalization in any given month.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rohan Khera","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Snigdha Jain","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhenqiu Lin","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Joseph S.

Based on the predictions for short-term interval, these models can be tuned for forecasting in long-term intervals.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajan Gupta","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Pandey","author_inst":"The NorthCap University"},{"author_name":"Poonam Chaudhary","author_inst":"TheNorthCap University"},{"author_name":"Saibal Kumar Pal","author_inst":"DRDO, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Barciela Brandao","author_inst":"State University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Ajay Kumar Saxena","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University, India"},{"author_name":"Ho-Joon Shin","author_inst":"Ajou University, South Korea"},{"author_name":"Michael Kolbe","author_inst":"Helmholzt-Center for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kailash Pandey","author_inst":"National Institute of Malaria Research, India"},{"author_name":"Xiuling Zhi","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Meng","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20050450","rel_title":"Reporting the life tracks of confirmed cases can effective prevent and control the COVID-19 outbreak in China","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20050450","rel_abs":"Background: Since late December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China.

The authors report that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had significant virus reducing effects, and that dual treatment of both HCQ and azithromycin further enhanced virus reduction. This data has triggered speculation whether these drugs should be considered as candidates for the treatment of severe COVID-19. However, questions have been raised regarding the study's data integrity, statistical analyses, and experimental design. We therefore reanalysed the original data to interrogate the main claims of the paper. Here we apply Bayesian statistics to assess the robustness of the original papers claims by testing four variants of the data: 1) The original data; 2) Data including patients who deteriorated; 3) Data including patients who deteriorated with exclusion of untested patients in the comparison group; 4) Data that includes patients who deteriorated with the assumption that untested patients were negative. To ask if HCQ monotherapy is effective, we performed an A\/B test for a model which assumes a positive effect, compared to a model of no effect. We find that the statistical evidence is highly sensitive to these data variants. Statistical evidence for the positive effect model ranged from strong for the original data (BF ~11), to moderate when including patients who deteriorated (BF ~4.35), to anecdotal when excluding untested patients (BF ~2), and to anecdotal negative evidence if untested patients were assumed positive (BF ~0.6). To assess whether HCQ is more effective when combined with AZ, we performed the same tests, and found only anecdotal evidence for the positive effect model for the original data (BF ~2.8), and moderate evidence for all other variants of the data (BF ~5.6). Our analyses only explore the effects of different assumptions about excluded and untested patients. These assumptions are not adequately reported, nor are they justified in the original paper, and we find that varying them causes substantive changes to the evidential support for the main claims of the original paper. This statistical uncertainty is exacerbated by the fact that the treatments were not randomised, and subject to several confounding variables including the patients' consent to treatment, different care centres, and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, while the viral load measurements were noisy, showing multiple reversals between test outcomes, there is greater certainty around other clinical outcomes such as the 4 patients who seriously deteriorated. The fact that all of these belonged to the HCQ monotherapy group should be assigned greater weight when evaluating the potential clinical efficacy of HCQ. Randomised controlled trials are currently underway, and will be critical in resolving this uncertainty as to whether HCQ and AZ are effective as a treatment for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oliver J Hulme","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"},{"author_name":"Eric-Jan Wagenmakers","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Per Damkier","author_inst":"Odense University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Fugl Madelung","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"},{"author_name":"Hartwig Roman Siebner","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"},{"author_name":"Jannik Helweg-Larsen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Quentin Gronau","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lars Benfield","author_inst":"Amager Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer H Madsen","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"},{"author_name":"Xiuling Zhi","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Meng","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20048876","rel_title":"Japanese citizens' behavioral changes and preparedness against COVID-19: How effective is Japan's approach of self-restraint?","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20048876","rel_abs":"The Japanese government instituted countermeasures against COVID-19, a pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, in January 2020. Seeking \"people's behavioral changes,\" in which the government called on the public to take precautionary measures or exercise self-restraint, was one of the important strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under these circumstances, where the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, we had recruited a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years. About 85% reported practising the social distancing recommended by the government. More females than males and more older than younger participants are supportive of practicing social distancing. Frequent handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all, 92 percent of female and 87.9 percent of over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 (23%). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60% of the participants, was deemed trustworthy by 50%. However, the results also showed that about 20% of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, from lower-income households, with a drinking or smoking habit and a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioral changes using various means to reach and influence them.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaori Muto","author_inst":"The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Isamu Yamamoto","author_inst":"Faculty of Business and Commerce, Keio University"},{"author_name":"Miwako Nagasu","author_inst":"Faculty of Economics, Keio University"},{"author_name":"Mikihito Tanaka","author_inst":"Faculty of Political Science and Economics, Waseda University"},{"author_name":"Koji Wada","author_inst":"Graduate School of Medicine and Public Health International University of Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Jannik Helweg-Larsen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Quentin Gronau","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lars Benfield","author_inst":"Amager Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer H Madsen","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"},{"author_name":"Xiuling Zhi","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Meng","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20049668","rel_title":"Spatial variability in the risk of death from COVID-19 in Italy, 2020","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20049668","rel_abs":"Objectives: Italy has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming the nation with the third highest death toll in the world as of May 10th, 2020. We analyzed the severity of COVID-19 pandemic across 20 Italian regions. Method: We manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 across 20 Italian regions. For each region, we estimated the crude case fatality ratio and time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio (aCFR). We then assessed the association between aCFR and sociodemographic, health care and transmission factors using multivariate regression analysis. Results: The overall aCFR in Italy was estimated at 17.4%. Lombardia exhibited the highest aCFR (24.7%) followed by Marche (19.3%), Emilia Romagna (17.7%) and Liguria (17.6%). Our aCFR estimate was greater than 10% for 12 regions. Our aCFR estimates were statistically associated with population density and cumulative morbidity rate in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Our aCFR estimates for overall Italy and for 7 out of 20 regions exceeded those reported for the most affected region in China.

To provide sufficient information for all involved decision-makers (clinicians, public health authorities, drug regulatory agencies) a multiplicity of endpoints must be considered. It is a challenge to generate detailed high quality evidence from data while ensuring fast availability and evaluation of the results. Methods: We reviewed all interventional COVID-19 trials on Remdesivir, Lopinavir\/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine registered in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and summarized the endpoints used to assess treatment effects. We propose a multistate model that harmonizes heterogeneous endpoints and differing lengths of follow-up within and between trials. Results: There are currently, March 27, 2020, 23 registered interventional trials investigating the potential benefits of Remdesivir, Lopinavir\/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine. The endpoints are highly heterogeneous. Follow-up for the primary endpoints ranges from four to 168 days. A detailed precisely defined endpoint has been proposed by the global network REMAP-CAP, which is specialized on community-acquired pneumonia. Their seven-category endpoint accounts for major clinical events informative for all decision-makers. Moreover, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative is currently working on a core outcome set. We propose a multistate model that accommodates analysis of these recommended endpoints. The model allows for a detailed investigation of treatment effects for various endpoints over the course of time thereby harmonizing differing endpoints and lengths of follow-up. Conclusion: Multistate model analysis is a powerful tool to study clinically heterogeneous endpoints (mortality, discharge) as well as endpoints influencing hospital capacities (duration of hospitalization and ventilation) simultaneously over time. Our proposed model extracts all information available in the data and is - by harmonizing endpoints within and between trials - a step towards faster decision making. All ongoing clinical trials, especially those with severe cases, should accommodate primary analysis with a stacked probability plot of the major events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maja von Cube","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of"},{"author_name":"Marlon Grodd","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Wolkewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Derek Hazard","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jerome Lambert","author_inst":"University of Paris, Paris, France; ECSTRA Team, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Research Centre UMR 1153, Inserm, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jannik Helweg-Larsen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Quentin Gronau","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lars Benfield","author_inst":"Amager Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer H Madsen","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"},{"author_name":"Xiuling Zhi","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Meng","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20046151","rel_title":"Clinical features, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review of case reports and case series","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20046151","rel_abs":"Objectives: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a public health emergency worldwide. The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the clinical, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a structured search using PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to collect both case reports and case series on COVID-19 published up to February 30, 2020. Results: Thirty-four articles were included analyzing a total of 99 patients with a mean age of 46.2 years. The most common presenting symptom in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was fever, reported in up to 83% of patients from 76.4% of the analyzed studies. Other symptoms including rhinorrhea, dizziness, and chills were less frequently reported. Additionally, in studies which reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements (44%), a large majority of patients displayed an elevated CRP (73%). Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-19 (33%). CT images displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns (80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (71.0%). The most commonly used antiviral treatment modalities included, lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride (influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor). Conclusions: Development of ARDS may play a role in estimating disease progression and mortality risk. Early detection of elevations in serum CRP, combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for presence and severity of disease. There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. There is currently not a well-established gold standard therapy for the treatment of diagnosed COVID-19.

The aims of this systematic review were to summarize the possible symptoms, treatments, and pregnancy outcomes of women infected with COVID-19 during their pregnancy. Methods: Four databases (Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched on March 25, 2020, using the following keywords: 'COVID-19', 'nCoV-2019', and 'coronavirus'. Articles included if they reported either the symptoms, treatments for the women who had been infected with the COVID-19 during their pregnancy or pregnancy outcomes. The selected articles' results were summarized employing a narrative synthesis approach. Results: A total of nine studies were selected for this study, comprising 101 infected pregnant women. Other than the infected general population, infected pregnant women reported different symptoms; however, fever (66.7%), cough (39.4%), fatigue (15.2%), and breathing difficulties (14.1%) were common. Infected pregnant women were given different treatments than the general infected population. The C-section was a common (83.9%) mode of delivery among infected pregnant women, and a higher proportion of births were preterm births (30.4%) and low birth weight (17.9%). Conclusions: Pregnant infected women had different symptoms, and they were given dissimilar treatments than the general infected population. Healthcare providers may have appropriately informed about these symptoms and treatments. They, therefore, would be able to handle infection during pregnancy effectively, which would reduce common adverse consequences among infected pregnant women.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re-routing strategies to either transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) or ventilators, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We validate our approach with realistic data from the United Kingdom and Spain. In the UK, we consider the National Health Service at the level of trusts and define a 4-regular geometric graph which indicates the four nearest neighbours of any given trust. In Spain we coarse-grain the healthcare system at the level of autonomous communities, and extract similar contact networks. Through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy, where the cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity. Our framework is general and flexible allowing for additional criteria, alternative cost functions, and can be extended to other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand, we show that it is possible to enable access to ICU for up to 1000 additional cases in the UK in a single step of the algorithm. Under a more realistic and heterogeneous demand, our method is able to balance about 600 beds per step in the Spanish system only using local sharing, and over 1300 using countrywide sharing, potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Lacasa","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert Challen","author_inst":"EPSRC Centre for Predictive Modelling in Healthcare, University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Md.

As exploratory studies have suggested that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in cases of complicated COVID-19 and that the anti-IL-6 biologic tocilizumab may be beneficial, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence in this field. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies investigating the immunological response in COVID-19 or its treatment with tocilizumab; additional grey literature searches were undertaken. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random effects models. Results: Eight published studies, three pre-prints, and five registered trials were eligible. Meta-analysis of mean IL-6 concentrations demonstrated 2.9-fold higher levels in patients with complicated COVID-19 compared with patients with non-complicated disease (six studies; n=1302; 95%CI, 1.17-7.19; I2=100%). A single non-randomized, single-arm study assessed tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19, demonstrating decreased oxygen requirements, resolution of radiographic abnormalities, and clinical improvement. No adverse events or deaths were observed. Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. While inhibition of IL-6 with tocilizumab appears to be efficacious and safe in preliminary investigation, the results of several ongoing clinical trials should be awaited to better define the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 prior to routine clinical application.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Anthony Coomes","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Hourmazd Haghbayan","author_inst":"London Health Sciences Centre"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Md.

We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). Methods: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a \"lockdown\" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the lockdown to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. Findings: We found a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.2 to 2.9). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22 - 0.53) for physical contacts only. Interpretation: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"Kevin Van Zandvoort","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"Amy Gimma","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, Denmark Hill, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Soinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20049312","rel_title":"Projected ICU and Mortuary load due to COVID-19 in Sydney","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20049312","rel_abs":"The spread of COVID-19 is expected to put a large strain on many hospital resources, including ICU bed space, and mortuary capacity.

Methods: Taking Hubei province of China as an example, where COVID-19 was first reported and there were the most cases, we collected 53 days of confirmed cases (total 67773 cases) and ten meteorological parameters up to March 10. Correlation analysis and linear regression were used to judge the relationship of meteorological factors and increment of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Results: Under 95% CI, the increment of confirmed cases in Hubei were correlated with four meteorological parameters of average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure (equivalent to absolute humidity).The average pressure was positively correlated with the increment (r=+0.358).The negative correlations included average temperature (r=-0.306), minimum temperature (r=-0.347), and average water vapor pressure (r=-0.326). The linear regression results show if minimum temperature increases by 1, the incremental confirmed cases in Hubei decreases by 72.470 units on average. Conclusion: Statistically, the incidence of COVID-19 was correlated with average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure. It is positively correlated with the average pressure and negatively correlated with the other three parameters. Compared with relative humidity, 2019-nCov is more sensitive to water vapor pressure. The reason why the epidemic situation in Hubei expanded rapidly is significantly related to the climate characteristics of low temperature and dryness of Hubei in winter.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianfeng Li","author_inst":"Beijing Municipal Institute of Labour Protections, Beijing Academy of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Linyuan Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ren","author_inst":"National Meteorological Information Center, China Meteorological Administration Meteorological Data Center"},{"author_name":"Caihong Xing","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peihuan Qiao","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Chang","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Russell Thomson","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Rosalind Wang","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Soinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20050542","rel_title":"Using ILI surveillance to estimate state-specific case detection rates and forecast SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20050542","rel_abs":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections to date has relied on RT-PCR testing. However, a failure to identify early cases imported to a country, bottlenecks in RT-PCR testing, and the existence of infections which are asymptomatic, sub-clinical, or with an alternative presentation than the standard cough and fever have resulted in an under-counting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how publicly available CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be repurposed to estimate the detection rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with COVID case counts across states. By quantifying the number of excess ILI patients in March relative to previous years and comparing excess ILI to confirmed COVID case counts, we estimate the syndromic case detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the US to be less than 13%. If only 1\/3 of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 sought care, the ILI surge would correspond to more than 8.7 million new SARS-CoV-2 infections across the US during the three week period from March 8 to March 28. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the US, we also show that the early epidemic in the US was unlikely to be doubling slower than every 4 days. Together these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID epidemic in the US in which rapid spread across the US are combined with a large population of infected patients with presumably mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data, and discuss the broader potential to use syndromic time series for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin D Silverman","author_inst":"Penn State"},{"author_name":"Nathaniel Hupert","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Alex D Washburne","author_inst":"Montana State University"},{"author_name":"Caihong Xing","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peihuan Qiao","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Chang","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Russell Thomson","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Rosalind Wang","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Soinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20049130","rel_title":"Modelling the COVID-19 epidemics in Brasil: Parametric identification and public health measures influence","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20049130","rel_abs":"A SIRU-type epidemic model is employed for the prediction of the COVID-19 epidemy evolution in Brazil, and analyse the influence of public health measures on simulating the control of this infectious disease. Since the reported cases are typically only a fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, the model accounts for both reported and unreported cases. Also, the model allows for a time variable functional form of both the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, so as to reflect public health interventions, towards its control, along the course of the epidemic evolution. An analytical exponential behaviour for the accumulated reported cases evolution is assumed at the onset of the epidemy, for explicitly estimating initial conditions, while a Bayesian inference approach is adopted for parametric estimations employing the present direct problem model with the data from the known portion of the epidemics evolution, represented by the time series for the reported cases of infected individuals. The direct-inverse problem analysis is then employed with the actual data from China, with the initial phase of the data been employed for the parametric estimation and the remaining data being used for validation of the predictive capability of the proposed approach. The full dataset for China is then employed in another parameter identification, aimed at refining the values for the average times that asymptomatic infectious individuals and that symptomatic individuals remain infectious. Following this validation, the available data on reported cases in Brazil from February 15th till March 29th, 2020, is used for estimating parameters and then predict the epidemy evolution from these initial conditions. As for the China analysis, the data for the reported cases in Brazil from March 30th till April 23rd are reserved for validation of the model. Finally, public health interventions are simulated, aimed at evaluating the effects on the disease spreading, by acting on both the transmission rate and the fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, considering time variable exponential behaviours for these two parameters, usually assumed constant in epidemic evolutions without intervention. It is demonstrated that a combination of actions to affect both parameters can have a more effective result in the control of the epidemy dynamics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renato Machado Cotta","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Carolina Palma Naveira-Cotta","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"pierre magal","author_inst":"University of Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Caihong Xing","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peihuan Qiao","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Chang","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Russell Thomson","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Rosalind Wang","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Soinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20049155","rel_title":"Parametric analysis of early data on COVID-19 expansion in selected European countries","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20049155","rel_abs":"We analyze the early data on COVID-19 expansion in selected European countries using an analytical parametric model.

We sequentially estimated sets of model parameters (maximum number of cases K, growth rate r, and half-time t0) and the epidemic \"end time\" t95 (defined as the time when the number of cases, predicted or actual, reached 95% of the maximum). The estimates of these parameters were done for sequences of reported cases growing daily (back-casting for China and forecasting for the US). In both countries, the estimates of K grew very much in time during the exponential and nearly exponential phases making longer term forecasting not reliable. For the US, the current estimate of the maximum number of cases K is about 265,000 but it is very likely that it will grow in the future.

At present two central public health control strategies have emerged: mitigation and suppression (e.g, [5]). Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long-term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, i.e., to develop what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. Recovered individuals, in the present context, represent those who have developed protective, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are no longer shedding virus [8]. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services (including but not limited to tending to the elderly [9], hospital care, schools, and food supply) while decreasing the probability of transmission during such essential interactions. We show that a shield immunity approach may significantly reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of an outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well recognized roles in estimating prevalence [10, 11] and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies [12-15].","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua S Weitz","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Beckett","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ashley R Coenen","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"David Demory","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Marian Dominguez-Mirazo","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Dushoff","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Chung-Yin Leung","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Guanlin Li","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Andreea Magalie","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sang Woo Park","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Rogelio Rodriguez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shashwat Shivam","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Conan Zhao","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20049692","rel_title":"The Effectiveness of Targeted Quarantine for Minimising Impact of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20049692","rel_abs":"We model the extent to which age targeted quarantine can be used to reduce ICU admissions caused by novel coronavirus COVID-19.
