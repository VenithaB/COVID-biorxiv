Here, using an ISG screen against VSV-SARS-CoV and VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric viruses, we identified CH25H and its enzymatic product 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) as potent inhibitors of virus replication. Mechanistically, internalized 25HC accumulates in the late endosomes and blocks cholesterol export, thereby restricting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein catalyzed membrane fusion. Our results highlight a unique antiviral mechanism of 25HC and provide the molecular basis for its possible therapeutic development.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siyuan Ding","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruochen Zang","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Florencia Gomez Castro","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhuoming Liu","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qiru Zeng","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Zhao","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Juhee Son","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Paul W.

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. However, no commercial vaccines against the coronaviruses that can infect humans are available. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs were observed to adopt two different conformational states (lying or standing). Then, structural and immunological analyses were used to explore differences in the immune response with RBDs among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies were induced by the S trimer with the RBD in the \"standing\" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S trimer with the RBD in the \"lying\" state (HCoV-229E), and the affinity between the RBD-specific antibodies and S trimer was also higher in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was much lower and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus. Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.\n\nImportanceOutbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in lying and standing state, respectively. Here, we tested the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that Beta-CoVs RBDs are in a standing state, and their S proteins can induce more neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD. However, HCoV-229E RBD is in a lying state, and its S protein induces a low level of neutralizing antibody targeting RBD. Our results indicate that Alpha-coronavirus is more conducive to escape host immune recognition, and also provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuejun Shi","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Jiale Shi","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Limeng Sun","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yubei Tan","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Gang Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Fenglin Guo","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Guangli Hu","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yanan Fu","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Zhen F.

Researchers immediately leveraged these data to infer the evolutionary relationships among viral samples and to study key biological questions, including whether host viral genome editing and recombination are features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques. There is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with lab-specific practices affect some sequences in the repositories. We find that some recurrent mutations in reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs, co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations. We show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing, and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation and\/or recombination among viral lineages. We suggest how samples can be screened and problematic mutations removed. We also develop tools for comparing and visualizing differences among phylogenies and we show that consistent clade- and tree-based comparisons can be made between phylogenies produced by different groups. These will facilitate evolutionary inferences and comparisons among phylogenies produced for a wide array of purposes. Building on the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser at UCSC, we present a toolkit to compare, analyze and combine SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies, find and remove potential sequencing errors and establish a widely shared, stable clade structure for a more accurate scientific inference and discourse.\n\nForewordWe wish to thank all groups that responded rapidly by producing these invaluable and essential sequence data. Their contributions have enabled an unprecedented, lightning-fast process of scientific discovery---truly an incredible benefit for humanity and for the scientific community. We emphasize that most lab groups with whom we associate specific suspicious alleles are also those who have produced the most sequence data at a time when it was urgently needed. We commend their efforts. We have already contacted each group and many have updated their sequences. Our goal with this work is not to highlight potential errors, but to understand the impacts of these and other kinds of highly recurrent mutations so as to identify commonalities among the suspicious examples that can improve sequence quality and analysis going forward.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yatish Turakhia","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Bryan Thornlow","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Landen Gozashti","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Angie Hinrichs","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Jason Fernandes","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"David Haussler","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Russ Corbett-Detig","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Yanan Fu","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Zhen F.

To gain a better understanding of coronavirus presence and diversity in wildlife at wildlife-human interfaces in three southern provinces in Viet Nam 2013-2014, we used consensus Polymerase Chain Reactions to detect coronavirus sequences. In comparison to previous studies, we observed high proportions of positive samples among field rats (34.0%, 239\/702) destined for human consumption and insectivorous bats in guano farms (74.8%, 234\/313) adjacent to human dwellings. Most notably among field rats, the odds of coronavirus RNA detection significantly increased along the supply chain from field rats sold by traders (reference group; 20.7% positivity, 39\/188) by a factor of 2.2 for field rats sold in large markets (32.0%, 116\/363) and 10.0 for field rats sold and served in restaurants (55.6%, 84\/151). Coronaviruses were detected in the majority of wildlife farms (60.7%, 17\/28) and in the Malayan porcupines (6.0%, 20\/331) and bamboo rats (6.3%, 6\/96) that are farmed. We identified six known coronaviruses in bats and rodents, clustered in three Coronaviridae genera, including the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronaviruses. Our analysis also suggested either mixing of animal excreta in the environment or interspecies transmission of coronaviruses, as both bat and avian coronaviruses were detected in rodent feces in the trade. The mixing of multiple coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the wildlife supply chain into restaurants, suggests maximal risk for end consumers and likely underpins the mechanisms of zoonotic spillover to people.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nguyen Quynh Huong","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Viet Nam Country Program, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Thanh Nga","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Viet Nam Country Program, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Van Long","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Bach Duc Luu","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Alice Latinne","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Viet Nam Country Program, Ha Noi, Viet Nam; Wildlife Conservation Society, Health Program, Bronx, New York, United States of Amer"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Pruvot","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Health Program, Bronx, New York, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Phuong","author_inst":"Regional Animal Health Office No. 6, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Le Tin Vinh Quang","author_inst":"Regional Animal Health Office No. 6, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Vo Van Hung","author_inst":"Regional Animal Health Office No. 6, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Lan","author_inst":"Viet Nam National University of Agriculture, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hoa","author_inst":"Viet Nam National University of Agriculture, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Phan Quang Minh","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Diep","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Tung","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Van Dang Ky","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam; Current address: The Animal Asia Foundation Viet Nam,"},{"author_name":"Scott I.

We developed a reverse transcription nested PCR endpoint assay (RT-nPCR) and showed that RT-nPCR has comparable performance to the standard RT-qPCR test. In the course of comparing the results of both tests, we found that the standard RT-qPCR test can have low detection efficiency (less than 50%) in a real testing scenario which may be only partly explained by low viral representation in many samples. This finding points to the importance of directly monitoring detection efficiency in test environments. We also suggest measures that would improve detection efficiency.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jayeshkumar Narsibhai Davda","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Keith Frank","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Sivakumar Prakash","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Gunjan Purohit","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Devi Prasad Vijayashankar","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Dhiviya Vedagiri","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Karthik Bharadwaj Tallapaka","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Krishnan Harinivas Harshan","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biollgy"},{"author_name":"Archana Bharadwaj Siva","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Kumar Mishra","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Jyotsna Dhawan","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Imran Siddiqi","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Diep","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Tung","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Van Dang Ky","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam; Current address: The Animal Asia Foundation Viet Nam,"},{"author_name":"Scott I.

Till the second week of April 2020, high incidence (2.9\/100,000) and cases fatality rates (1.7%) were observed in Pakistan. This study was conducted to determine the temporal and spatial distribution of the first 100 deaths attributed to COVID-19 in Pakistan and their associated demographic factors. Method: We conducted a descriptive epidemiological analysis of the first 100 deaths reported among RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases. Demographic, epidemiological, and risk factors information was obtained associated comorbidities and clinical signs and symptoms were recorded and frequencies were determined. Results: A total of 100 mortalities with overall Case Fatality Rate 1.67% (CFR) were analysed. Median age of patients was 64.5 years (IQR: 54-70) with 75% (n=75) Males. Among all deaths reported, 71 (71%) cases had one or more documented comorbidities at the time of diagnosis. Most frequently reported co-morbidities were; hypertension (67 %), followed by Diabetes Mellitus 945%) and Ischemic Heart Diseases (27%). First death was reported on 18 March 2020 and the most frequent presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (87%) and fever (79%). Median duration of illness was eight days (IQR: 4-11 days), the median delay reaching hospital to seek health care was three days (IQR: 0-6 days) while median duration of hospital stay was also three days (IQR: 1-7 days). Among all reported deaths, 62% were attributed to local transmission as these cases had no history of international travel. The most affected age group was 60-69 years while no death reported in age group below 20 years. Conclusion: High CFR among old age group and its association with co-morbidities (chronic disease) suggests targeted interventions such as social distancing and strict quarantine measure for elderly and morbid people. Comparative studies among deaths and recovered patients are recommended to explore further disease dynamics.

Material and methods: Study of qualitative approach, of phenomenological design, where 80 obstetric interns from the different regions of Peru participated, who are also representatives of their hospital headquarters. An in-depth interview was applied where the perception of hospital practices was addressed according to: i) current problems and ii) solution proposals. Results: Midwifery interns have been removed from hospital practices, mainly due to the absence of personal protective equipment and health insurance, financially affecting those who must continue to make rent and food payments; Likewise, a large part of the universities have not offered proposals for solutions to the delay in internships, raising concerns about delays in administrative procedures, even more so for students from non-licensed universities. Among the proposals, those who are close to graduating suggest being exempted from the months when there were no activities, so as not to delay future processes such as tuition and rural service; likewise, suspend payment for these months and strengthen knowledge through the discussion of clinical cases, which could be virtual. Conclusions: The cessation of hospital practice responds to a lack of guarantees in the health care of the student, generating economic repercussions and a negative perception regarding university management. Finally, solutions that could be considered for the next decisions made by the institutions are reported.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica Rojas-Silva Sr.","author_inst":"Asociacion Nacional de Estudiantes de Obstetricia del Peru"},{"author_name":"Valery Damacen-Oblitas Sr.","author_inst":"Asociacion Nacional de Estudiantes de Obstetricia del Peru"},{"author_name":"Diayan Castro-Gomez","author_inst":"Asociacion Nacional de Estudiantes de Obstetricia del Peru"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Rojas-Vega Sr.","author_inst":"Asociacion Nacional de Estudiantes de Obstetricia del Peru"},{"author_name":"John Barja-Ore","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos"},{"author_name":"Randol Vila-Arevalo Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos"},{"author_name":"Victor Hugo Moquillaza-Alcantara Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Jamil Ahmad Ansari","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Asif Syed","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Wasif Javed","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Larik","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Mohsan Wattoo","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Naveed Masood","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training"},{"author_name":"zeeshan Iqbal Baig","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Khurram Akram","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Scott I.

In this paper, we develop a clinical strategy for prescribing PCR to patients based on data from COVIDOM, a French cohort of 54,000 patients with clinically suspected Covid-19 including 12,810 patients tested by PCR. Using a machine learning algorithm (a decision tree), we show that symptoms alone are sufficient to predict PCR outcome with a mean average precision of 86%. We identify combinations of symptoms that are predictive of PCR positivity (90% for anosmia\/ageusia) or negativity (only 30% of PCR+ for a subgroup with cardiopulmonary symptoms): in both cases, PCR provides little added diagnostic value. We deduce a prescribing strategy based on clinical presentation that can improve the global efficiency of PCR testing.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- AP-HP \/ Universities \/ Inserm COVID-19 research co COVID-19 research collaboration members","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Caroline Apra","author_inst":"Sorbonne University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Caucheteux","author_inst":"University Paris Saclay"},{"author_name":"Arthur Mensch","author_inst":"Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jenny Mansour","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France"},{"author_name":"Melodie Bernaux","author_inst":"AP-HP, Direction de la strategie et de la transformation, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Agnes dechartres","author_inst":"Sorbonne University, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique, UMR-S 1136, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Erwan Debuc","author_inst":"Sorbonne University, AP-HP, Saint Antoine Hospital, Service d'Accueil des Urgences, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Xavier Lescure","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases , APHP, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Aurelien Dinh","author_inst":"Infectious disease department, R.

is essential to controlling the pandemic and facilitating safe resumption of clinical care, employment and other social activities. Methods: This study was conducted to validate an self-administrable saliva-based RT-qPCR test for the SARS-CoV2 virus under controlled laboratory conditions (analytical validation) according to federal guidance. An additional clinical study assessed positive (n=34) and negative (n=57) nasopharyngeal swab samples collected contemporaneously with saliva samples. Assessments for analytical specificity, sensitivity, cross reactivity and sample stability to simulate shipping conditions were conducted. Results: Positive and negative agreement with third-party laboratory results were reported as 97.1% and 96.5-98.2%, respectively. Limit of detection was established at 5 copies\/L. Stability through simulated shipping conditions found 100% concordance up to 56 hours after collection. Discussion: These data validate a self-collected saliva-based COVID-19 RT-qPCR assay that performs comparably well to an assay of health care-provider administered nasopharyngeal swab samples. Accordingly, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization in June 2020. Use of the saliva-based assay overcomes barriers to the necessary widespread testing, including strained health care resources, supply chain disruptions of laboratory materials, testing and protective equipment and exposure risks due to close interpersonal contact.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meghan Miller","author_inst":"Phosphorus Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Michael

Tocilizumab, a drug targeting interleukin-6 administrated in the right timeframe may be beneficial in coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess its benefit, drawing from observations in compassionately treated patients. Methods: In a retrospective case-control study, treatment effect (tocilizumab 400mg, single-dose) was assessed using three statistical methods: propensity-score matching, Cox multivariable survival and inverse probability score weighting (IPSW) analyses. Were included all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, who presented severity criteria with SpO2<96% despite O2-support >6L\/min for more than 6 hours. Were excluded patients in critical care medicine department and those under invasive mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was a composite of mortality and ventilation, with a maximum follow-up of 28 days. Results: 246 patients were included (106 treated by tocilizumab). They were 67.6 +\/-15.3 years-old, with 95 (38.5%) women. Delay between first symptoms and inclusion was 8.4 +\/-4.5 days. Overall, 105 (42.7%) patients presented the primary outcome, with 71 (28.9%) deaths during the 28-days follow-up. Propensity-score-matched 84 pairs of comparable patients. In the matched cohort (n=168), tocilizumab was associated with fewer primary outcomes (hazard ratio (HR)=0.49 (95% confidence interval (95CI)=0.3-0.81), p-value=0.005). These results were similar in the overall cohort (n=246), with Cox multivariable analysis yielding a protective association between tocilizumab and primary outcome (adjusted HR=0.26 (95CI=0.135-0.51, p=0.0001), confirmed by IPSW analysis (p<0.0001). Analyses on mortality with 28-days follow-up yielded similar results. Conclusion: In this retrospective study, tocilizumab single-dose was associated with improved survival without mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Rossi","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Lee S Nguyen","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Philippe Zimmermann","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Faiza Boucenna","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Louise Baucher","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Louis Dubret","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Helene Guillot","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Marie-anne Bouldouyre","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Yves Allenbach","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite -

So far, there is no direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission and the mechanisms leading to the adverse outcomes are not well understood Results An asymptomatic pregnant woman with preterm fetal distress during the COVID19 pandemic was included. We obtained multiple maternal, placental and neonatal swabs, which showed a median viral load in maternal blood, urine, oropharynx, fornix posterior over a period of 6 days was 5.0 log copies \/mL. The maternal side of the placenta had a viral load of 4.42 log copies \/mL, while the fetal side had 7.15 log copies \/mL. Maternal breast milk, feces and all neonatal samples tested negative. Serology of immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 was tested positive in maternal blood, but negative in umbilical cord and neonatal blood. Pathological examination of the placenta included immunohistochemical investigation against SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression in combination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy. It showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles with generalized inflammation characterized by histiocytic intervillositis with diffuse perivillous fibrin depositions with damage to the syncytiotrophoblasts. Discussion Placental infection by SARS-CoV-2 lead to fibrin depositions hampering fetal-maternal gas exchange most likely resulted in fetal distress necessitating a premature emergency caesarean section. Postpartum, the neonate showed a clinical presentation resembling a pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome including coronary artery ectasia, most likely associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) for which admittance and care on the Neonatal Intensive Care unit (NICU) was required, despite being negative for SARS-CoV-2. This highlights the need for awareness of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes during the current COVID-19 pandemic, especially considering that the majority of pregnant women appear asymptomatic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sam Schoenmakers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Pauline Snijder","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rob

indirectly by measuring the host immune response. Anti-viral antibody concentrations generally correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods: Sera (n=533) from patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 (n=153) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative IgM and IgG assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. Results: Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. Conclusions: High sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease. These differences may affect strategies for seroprevalence studies, therapeutics and vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kara Lake Lynch","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

The use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is controversial and its mode of action poorly understood. We demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity at the functional and epigenetic level and is accompanied by profound changes in the cellular lipidome as well as reduced expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Trained immunity comprises a functional adaptation induced by epigenetic reprogramming which facilitates the anti-viral innate immune response. Our findings therefore suggest that hydroxychloroquine may not have a beneficial effect on the anti-viral immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nils Rother","author_inst":"Radboudumc"},{"author_name":"Cansu Yanginlar","author_inst":"Radboudumc"},{"author_name":"Rik G.H.

We compare this with the Q-SEIR model, recently developed, and demonstrate the control of COVID-19 without the stringent conditions of community quarantine. We analyzed the sensitivity and elasticity indices of the parameters with respect to the reproduction number. Results suggest that a control strategy that involves maximizing  and {varepsilon} is likely to be successful, although quarantine is still more effective in limiting the spread of the virus. Release from quarantine depends on continuance and strict adherence to recommended social and health-promoting behaviors. Furthermore, maximizing  and {varepsilon} is equivalent to a 50% successful quarantine in disease-free equilibrium (DFE).

Eventually, such characteristics are also observed between different regions of the same country. Herewith, we study the heterogeneous spreading of the confirmed infected cases and deaths by the COVID-19 until May 30th, 2020, in the Brazilian territory, which has been seen as the current epicenter of the pandemic in South America. Our first set of results is related to the similarities and it shows that: (i) a power-law growth of the cumulative number of infected people is observed for federative units of the five regions of Brazil; and (ii) the Distance Correlation (DC) calculated between the time series of the most affected federative units and the curve that describes the evolution of the pandemic in Brazil remains about 1 in most of the time, while such quantity calculated for the federative units with a low incidence of newly infected people remains about 0.95. In the second set of results, we focus on the heterogeneous distribution of the confirmed cases and deaths, which is demonstrated by the fact that only three regions concentrate 92% of the cases. By applying the epidemiological SIRD model we estimated the effective reproduction number Re during the pandemic evolution and found that: (i) the mean value of Re for the eight most affected federative units in Brazil is about 2; (ii) the current value of Re for Brazil is greater than 1, which indicates that the epidemic peak is far; and (iii) Ceara was the only federative unit for which the current Re < 1. Based on these findings, we projected the effects of increase or decrease the effective reproduction number and concluded that if the value of Re increases 20%, not only the peak might grow at least 40% but also its occurrence might be anticipated, which hastens the collapse of the public health care system. In all cases, to keep the effective reproduction number 20% below the current one can save thousands of people in the long term.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael Marques Da Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fabio de Oliveira Mendes","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Amazonas"},{"author_name":"Cesar Manchein","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Salvador E.

Objectives To study whether use of NSAIDs is associated with adverse outcomes and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Population based cohort study Setting Danish administrative and health registries. Participants Individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during Feb 27, 2020 to Apr 29, 2020. Treated individuals (defined as a filled NSAID prescription up to 30 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test) were matched to up to 4 non-treated individuals on propensity scores based on age, sex, relevant comorbidities and prescription fills. Outcome measures The main outcome was 30-day mortality and treated individuals were compared to untreated individuals using risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD). Secondary outcomes included hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and acute renal replacement therapy. Results A total of 9236 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive individuals were eligible for inclusion. Of these, 248 (2.7%) had filled a prescription for NSAIDs and 535 (5.8%) died within 30 days. In the matched analyses, treatment with NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.82; RD 0.1%, -3.5% to 3.7%), increased risk of hospitalisation (RR 1.16, 0.87 to 1.53; RD 3.3%, -3.4% to 10%), ICU-admission (RR 1.04, 0.54 to 2.02; RD 0.2%, -3.0% to 3.4%), mechanical ventilation (RR 1.14, 0.56 to 2.30; RD 0.5%, -2.5% to 3.6%), or renal replacement therapy (RR 0.86, 0.24 to 3.09; RD -0.2%, -2.0% to 1.6%). Conclusion Use of NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality, hospitalisation, ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy in Danish individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The S protein is the Trojan horse of coronaviruses, mediating their entry into the host cells. While SARS-CoV-2 was becoming a global threat, scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at an impressive pace, both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional structures. On April 21st, the GISAID resource had collected 10,823 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. We extracted from them all the complete S protein sequences and identified point mutations thereof. Six mutations were located on a 14-residue segment (929-943) in the \"fusion core\" of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1). Our modeling in the pre- and post-fusion S protein conformations revealed, for three of them, the loss of interactions stabilizing the post-fusion assembly. On May 29th, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in GISAID were 34,805. An analysis of the occurrences of the HR1 mutations in this updated dataset revealed a significant increase for the S929I and S939F mutations and a dramatic increase for the D936Y mutation, which was particularly widespread in Sweden and Wales\/England. We notice that this is also the mutation causing the loss of a strong inter-monomer interaction, the D936-R1185 salt bridge, thus clearly weakening the post-fusion assembly.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luigi Cavallo","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Physical Sciences and Engineering Division"},{"author_name":"Romina Oliva","author_inst":"University of Naples Parthenope, Department of Sciences and Technologies"},{"author_name":"Mette Reilev","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Steffen Christensen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Reimar W.

Aim To explore patterns of mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for palliative care provision, planning, and research. Design Descriptive analysis and population-based modelling of routine data. Participants and setting All deaths registered in England and Wales between 7th March and 15th May 2020. We described the following mortality categories by age, gender and place of death: 1) baseline deaths (deaths that would typically occur in a given period) 2) COVID-19 deaths 3) additional deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19. We estimated the proportion of COVID-19 deaths among people who would be in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic, using simple modelling with explicit assumptions. Results During the first 10 weeks of the pandemic there were 101,615 baseline deaths, 41,105 COVID-19 deaths and 14,520 additional deaths. Deaths in care homes increased by 220% compared to home and hospital deaths which increased by 77% and 90%. Hospice deaths fell by 20%. Additional deaths were among older people (86% aged [&ge;]75 years), and most occurred in care homes (56%) and at home (43%). We estimate that 44% (38% to 50%) of COVID-19 deaths occurred among people who would have been in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic. Conclusions Healthcare systems must ensure availability of palliative care to support people with severe COVID-19 in community and hospital settings. Integrated models of palliative care in care homes are urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna E Bone","author_inst":"Cicely Saunders Institute of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anne M Finucane","author_inst":"Marie Curie Hospice Edinburgh & University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Javiera Leniz","author_inst":"Cicely Saunders Institute of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Irene J Higginson","author_inst":"Cicely Saunders Institute of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katherine E Sleeman","author_inst":"Cicely Saunders Institute of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christian F.

The WHO has also accepted that the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is going to last longer, and suggested that one needs to learn to live with this virus. Accepting this bitter truth that this pandemic is going to be a new normal and people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus; however, older people and those with chronic diseases are more vulnerable to the virus. The study tries to access the household with at least one patient with few selected chronic diseases in India, which are presumed to be at a higher risk of losing at least one individual if this pandemic scenario is going to last long and spread is wider. The study used nationally representative data (NSSO) for information on morbidity and other health-related issues. Data from the official website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare dedicated to COVID-19 reports have been used to look into the recent happenings caused by COVID-19 pandemic in India. Bivariate analysis has been used to calculate household at risk, and binary logistic regression has been used for the likelihood of household at risk. The case-fatality ratio is calculated using the number of confirmed cases and the number deceased due to the same. The study found that about 9.4% of Indian households are at a higher risk of losing at least one individual. Older people (60+), males and households with better economic status are at a higher risk. The chronic condition varies by states and social-economic and demographic status. The share of households at higher risk was highest in Kerala (33.19%), followed by Andhra Pradesh (19.85%) and Chandigarh (19.05%).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajeev Ranjan Singh","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Palak Sharma","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Priya Maurya","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Irene J Higginson","author_inst":"Cicely Saunders Institute of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katherine E Sleeman","author_inst":"Cicely Saunders Institute of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christian F.

The aims of this study were to quantify changes to sleep\/wake behavior and exercise patterns (e.g., exercise frequency, modality, and intensity), and the subsequent impact on physiological markers of health (e.g., total sleep duration, social jet lag, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability) with the introduction of physical distancing mandates and recommendations. A retrospective analysis of 50,000 subscribers to the WHOOP platform (mean age = 36.6 {+\/-} 10.5; 11,956 females, 38,044 males) was conducted covering the period from January 1st, 2020 through May 15th, 2020. In order to make robust comparisons, this time period was separated into a 68 day baseline period and a 67 day physical distancing period - with a total of 6.3 million sleeps and 4.9 million exercise sessions analyzed. As compared to baseline, during physical distancing, all subjects analyzed in this study dedicated more time to sleep (+0.21 hours), fell asleep earlier (-0.43 hours), woke up earlier (-0.29 hours), obtained more sleep (+0.19 hours) and reduced social jet lag (-0.23 hours). Subjects also increased exercise frequency by an average of 1.1% and increased exercise intensity by spending an average of 1.8% more time in the three highest heart rate zones. These changes to sleep and exercise behavior may have contributed to the observed lowered resting heart rate (-0.9 beats per minute) and increased heart rate variability (+1.3 milliseconds) during physical distancing. A potential explanation for these results is that decreases in business hours-based commitments during physical distancing may have resulted in increased opportunity to engage in exercise and prioritize sleep. Therefore, as the COVID-19 pandemic eases, maintenance of certain aspects of physical distancing (e.g., flexibility to work from home) may result in a healthier population.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily R Capodilupo","author_inst":"Whoop, Inc., Department of Data Science and Research"},{"author_name":"Dean J Miller","author_inst":"CQUniversity"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Irene J Higginson","author_inst":"Cicely Saunders Institute of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katherine E Sleeman","author_inst":"Cicely Saunders Institute of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christian F.

Currently, no evidence exists regarding possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancies. Methods Cohort 1 included pregnant women with a double test taken between Feb. 17 and Apr. 23, 2020, during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in Denmark. The double test was taken as part of the first trimester risk assessment. Cohort 2 included women with a first trimester pregnancy loss before double test. Serum from the double test or from a blood sample, in case of pregnancy loss, was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The results were correlated to the nuchal translucency thickness and the number of pregnancy losses. Results In total, 1,019 pregnant women with double test and 36 women with pregnancy loss participated in the study. Thirty (2.9%) women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum from the double test. All women with pregnancy loss prior to the double test were negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There were no significant differences in nuchal translucency thickness for women testing positive (n=14) versus negative (p=0.20) or grey zone (n=16) versus negative (p=0.28). In total, 54 women experienced a pregnancy loss of whom two had grey zone or positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Conclusion Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection did not seem harmful in first trimester pregnancies. Infection had no effect on the nuchal translucency thickness and women with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not overrepresented among women with pregnancy loss.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nina la Cour Freiesleben","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark and Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of "},{"author_name":"Pia Egerup","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Kathrine Vauvert Rommelmayer Hviid","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Elin Rosenbek Severinsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Astrid Marie Kolte","author_inst":"The Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Unit, The Capital Region, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark and  Institute of Clinical Medicine, F"},{"author_name":"David Westergaard","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark and Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University o"},{"author_name":"Line Fich Olsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lisbeth Praetorius","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anne Zedeler","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Ann-Marie Hellerung Christiansen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Josefine Reinhardt Nielsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Didi Bang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark."},{"author_name":"Sine Berntsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Olle-Lopez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Andreas Ingham","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Judith Bello-Rodriuez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Ditte Marie Storm","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Jeppe Ethelberg-Findsen","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Eva R Hoffmann","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Wilken-Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Finn Stener Jorgensen","author_inst":"Fetal Med.

Key questions are the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding. We assessed these questions using virus cultures of respiratory tract samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients as a proxy for infectious virus shedding. Methods Clinical and virological data were obtained from 129 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (89 intensive care, 40 medium care). Generalized estimating equations were used to identify if viral RNA load, detection of viral subgenomic RNA, serum neutralizing antibody response, duration of symptoms, or immunocompromised status were predictive for a positive virus culture. Findings Infectious virus shedding was detected in 23 of the 129 patients (17,8%). The median duration of shedding was 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5-11) and the probability of detecting infectious virus dropped below 5% after 15,2 days post onset of symptoms (95% confidence interval (CI) 13,4-17,2). Multivariate analyses identified viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies\/mL (odds ratio [OR]; CI 14,7 (3,57-58,1; p<0,001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract. A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0,01 (CI 0,003-0,08; p<0,001) was independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation Infection prevention and control guidelines should take into account that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 may shed infectious virus for longer periods of time compared to what has been reported for in patients with mild COVID-19. Infectious virus shedding drops to undetectable levels below a viral RNA load threshold and once serum neutralizing antibodies are present, which warrants the use of quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays in test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeroen J.A. van Kampen","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"David A.M.C. van de Vijver","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Pieter L.A.

Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the survival of patients admitted to Brazilian hospitals due to the COVID-19 and estimate prognostic factors. This is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study, based on data from 46285 hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Brazil. Survival functions were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Log-rank test compared the survival functions for each variable and from that, hazard ratios were calculated and the proportional hazards model was used in Cox multiple regression. The smallest survival curves were the ones for patients at the age of 68 years or more, black \/ brown race, illiterate, living in the countryside, dyspnea, respiratory distress, influenza-like outbreak, O2 saturation <95%, X-ray change, length of stay in the ICU, invasive ventilatory support, previous heart disease, pneumopathy, diabetes, down's syndrome, neurological disease and kidney disease. Better survival was observed in the symptoms and in an asthmatic patient. The multiple model for increased risk of death when they were admitted to the ICU HR 1.28 (95% CI 1.21;1.35), diabetes HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.11;1.24), neurological disease HR 1.34 (95% CI 1.22;1.46), kidney disease HR 1.11 (95% CI 1.02;1.21), heart disease HR 1.14 (95% CI 1.08;1.20), black or brown race of HR 1.50 (95% CI 1.43;1.58), asthma HR 0.71 (95% CI 0.61;0.81) and pneumopathy HR 1.12 (95% CI 1.02;1.23). The overall survival time was low in hospitalizations for COVID-19 and this reinforces the importance of sociodemographic and clinical factors as a prognosis for death. The lack of a protocol for scientific clinical management puts a greater risk of death for about 80 million Brazilians, who are chronically ill or living in poverty.

Understanding the introductions of this new coronavirus in different settings may assist control efforts and the establishment of frameworks to support rapid response in future infectious disease outbreaks. We investigated the first four weeks of emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Scotland after the first case reported on the 1st March 2020. We obtained full genome sequences from 452 individuals with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, representing 20% of all cases until 1st April 2020 (n=2310). This permitted a genomic epidemiology approach to study the introductions and spread of the SARS-2 virus in Scotland. From combined phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis, we estimated at least 113 introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland during this period. Clusters containing multiple sequences suggestive of onward transmission occurred in 48\/86 (56%). 42\/86 (51%) clusters had no known international travel history indicating undetected introductions. The majority of viral sequences were most closely related to those circulating in other European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. Travel-associated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland predated travel restrictions in the UK and other European countries. The first local transmission occurred three days after the first case. A shift from travel-associated to sustained community transmission was apparent after only 11 days. Undetected introductions occurred prior to the first known case of COVID-19. Earlier travel restrictions and quarantine measures might have resulted in fewer introductions into Scotland, thereby reducing the number of cases and the subsequent burden on health services. The high number of introductions and transmission rates were likely to have impacted on national contact tracing efforts. Our results also demonstrate that local real-time genomic epidemiology can be used to monitor transmission clusters and facilitate control efforts to restrict the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":42,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Da Silva Filipe","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"James Shepherd","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Thomas Williams","author_inst":"Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joseph Hughes","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Elihu Aranday-Cortes","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Patawee Asamaphan","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Carlos Balcazar","author_inst":"MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kirstyn Brunker","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Stephen Carmichael","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Dewar","author_inst":"Virology Department, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michael D Gallagher","author_inst":"MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Rory Gunson","author_inst":"West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre, NHSGGC"},{"author_name":"Antonia Ho","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Natasha Jesudason","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Natasha Johnson","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"E.

A large number of serologic tests, platforms and methodologies are being employed to determine seroprevalence in populations to select convalescent plasmas for therapeutic trials, and to guide policies about reopening. However, tests have substantial variability in sensitivity and specificity, and their ability to quantitatively predict levels of nAb is unknown. We collected 370 unique donors enrolled in the New York Blood Center Convalescent Plasma Program between April and May of 2020. We measured levels of antibodies in convalescent plasma using commercially available SARS-CoV-2 detection tests and in-house ELISA assays and correlated serological measurements with nAb activity measured using pseudotyped virus particles, which offer the most informative assessment of antiviral activity of patient sera against viral infection. Our data show that a large proportion of convalescent plasma samples have modest antibody levels and that commercially available tests have varying degrees of accuracy in predicting nAb activity. We found the Ortho Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Ig and IgG high throughput serological assays (HTSAs), as well as the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, quantify levels of antibodies that strongly correlate with nAb assays and are consistent with gold-standard ELISA assay results. These findings provide immediate clinical relevance to serology results that can be equated to nAb activity and could serve as a valuable roadmap to guide the choice and interpretation of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Larry L Luchsinger","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Brett Ransegnola","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Daniel Jin","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Frauke Muecksch","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yiska Weisblum","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Weili Bao","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Parakkal Jovvian George","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Marilis Rodriguez","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Nancy Tricoche","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Fabian Schmidt","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Chengjie Gao","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Shabnam Jawahar","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Mouli Pal","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Emily Schnall","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Donna Strauss","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Karina Yazdanbakhsh","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Martin McHugh","author_inst":"Virology Department, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh & University of St. Andrews"},{"author_name":"Jenna Nichols","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Marc Niebel","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Kyriaki Nomikou","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Richard J.

Methods We conducted a cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID 19 in Spain. The primary outcome was time to death and the secondary outcome time to intensive care unit admission (ICU) or death. We used inverse probability weighting to fit marginal structural models adjusted for time varying covariates to determine the causal relationship between tocilizumab use and the outcomes. Results A total of 1,229 and 10,673 person\/days were analyzed. In the adjusted marginal structural models, a significant interaction between tocilizumab use and high C reactive protein (CRP) levels was detected. Tocilizumab was associated with decreased risk of death (aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.72, p=0.005) and ICU admission or death (aHR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.81, p=0.011) among patients with baseline CRP >150 mg\/L, but not among those with CRP [&le;]150 mg\/L. Exploratory subgroup analyses yielded point estimates that were consistent with these findings. Conclusions In this large observational study, tocilizumab was associated with a lower risk of death or ICU or death in patients with higher CRP levels. While the results of ongoing clinical trials of tocilizumab in patients with COVID 19 will be important to establish its safety and efficacy, our findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials and support the use of tocilizumab among subjects with higher CRP levels.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier Martinez-Sanz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Muriel","author_inst":"Clinical Biostatistic Unit, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Departamento de Enfermeria y Fisioterapia, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, CIBERESP, Madrid, Sp"},{"author_name":"Raquel Ron","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Sabina Herrera","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Raquel Ron","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jose A Perez-Molina","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Santiago Moreno","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Sergio Serrano-Villar","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Nancy Tricoche","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Fabian Schmidt","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Chengjie Gao","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Shabnam Jawahar","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Mouli Pal","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Emily Schnall","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Donna Strauss","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Karina Yazdanbakhsh","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Martin McHugh","author_inst":"Virology Department, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh & University of St. Andrews"},{"author_name":"Jenna Nichols","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Marc Niebel","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Kyriaki Nomikou","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Richard J.
