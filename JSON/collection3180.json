This scenario has become catastrophic as there are no approved vaccines to prevent the disease, and the main measures to contain the virus transmission are confinement and social distancing. One priority strategy is based on drug repurposing by pursuing antiviral chemotherapy that can control transmission and prevent complications associated with covid-19. With this aim, we performed a high content screening assay for the discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. From the 65 screened compounds, we have found four drugs capable to selectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection: brequinar, abiraterone acetate, neomycin, and the extract of Hedera helix. Brequinar and abiraterone acetate had higher inhibition potency against SARS-CoV-2 than neomycin and Hedera helix extract, respectively. Drugs with reported antiviral activity and in clinical trials for covid-19, chloroquine, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide, were also included in the screening, and the last two were found to be non-selective. We used a data mining approach to build drug-host molecules-biological function-disease networks to show in a holistic way how each compound is interconnected with host node molecules and virus infection, replication, inflammatory response, and cell apoptosis. In summary, the present manuscript identified four drugs with active inhibition effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection, and by network analysis, we provided new insights and starting points for the clinical evaluation and repurposing process to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nSummary sentenceDiscovery of drug repurposing candidates, inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, using a phenotypic screening strategy and network analysis.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Douglas Ferreira Sales-Medina","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ludmila Rodrigues Pinto Ferreira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Lavinia M.

This pandemic has the potential to disrupt healthcare globally and has already caused high levels of mortality, especially amongst the elderly. The overall case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be [~]2.3% overall 3 and 32.3% in hospitalized patients age 70-79 years 4. Therapeutic options for treating the underlying viremia in COVID-19 are presently limited by a lack of effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs, although steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment can be helpful. A variety of potential antiviral targets for SARS-CoV-2 have been considered including the spike protein and replicase. Based upon previous successful antiviral drug development for HIV-1 and hepatitis C, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears an attractive target for drug development. Here we show the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of [~]6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro. In our primary screen we found [~]50 compounds with activity against Mpro (overall hit rate <0.75%). Subsequent dose validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 [&le;] 50 M. Hits from our screen are enriched with hepatitis C NS3\/4A protease targeting drugs including Boceprevir (IC50=0.95 M), Ciluprevir (20.77M). Narlaprevir (IC50=1.10M), and Telaprevir (15.25M). These results demonstrate that some existing approved drugs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and that screen saturation of all approved drugs is both feasible and warranted. Taken together this work suggests previous large-scale commercial drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3\/4A viral protease should be revisited because some previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than Boceprevir and suitable for rapid repurposing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy D Baker","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rikki L Uhrich","author_inst":"VA Puget Sound Health Care System"},{"author_name":"Gerald C Kraemer","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson High School"},{"author_name":"Jason E Love","author_inst":"Western Washington Pathology"},{"author_name":"Brian C Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Washington\/ VA Puget Sound"},{"author_name":"Gilles Courtemanche","author_inst":"Bioaster"},{"author_name":"Marcos S.

With the number of cases growing, the surface of a salmon chopping board in the market was examined for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and a positive reaction was observed. Following these test results, there has been debate over whether salmon can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. To find assess this, we investigated the structural homology of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host-side receptor for SARS-CoV-2, between humans and other species including salmon and mink. As a result, a high structural homology between ACE2 and mink, which has reportedly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans, was confirmed. However, a non-high structural homology of ACE2 between salmon and humans was observed.

Here, we evaluate heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lung tissues with additional spread to other organs. Remarkably, a decline in pulmonary function, as measured by static and dynamic tests of respiratory capacity, occurs 4 days after peak viral titer and correlates with an inflammatory response marked by infiltration into the lung of monocytes, neutrophils, and activated T cells resulting in pneumonia. Cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune response with prominent signatures of NF-kB-dependent, type I and II interferon signaling, and leukocyte activation pathways. Thus, the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulates many features of severe COVID-19 infection in humans and can be used to define the mechanistic basis of lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based countermeasures.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma S Winkler","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Adam L Bailey","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Natasha M Kafai","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Sharmila Nair","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Broc T McCune","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Jinsheng Yu","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Julie M Fox","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Rita E Chen","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"James T Earnest","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Shamus P Keeler","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Jon H Ritter","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Liang-I Kang","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Sarah Dort","author_inst":"SCIREQ Scientific Respiratory Equipment Inc"},{"author_name":"Annette Robichaud","author_inst":"SCIREQ Scientific Respiratory Equipment Inc"},{"author_name":"Richard Head","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Michael J Holtzman","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.194027","rel_title":"Severely ill COVID-19 patients display augmented functional properties in SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.194027","rel_abs":"The molecular properties of CD8+ T cells that respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully known.

COVID-19 patients segregated into two groups based on whether the dominant CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was  exhausted or not. SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the exhausted subset were increased in frequency and displayed lesser cytotoxicity and inflammatory features in COVID-19 patients with mild compared to severe illness.

Immunization of mice with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 elicits high titers of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and target the receptor binding domain that engages human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Upon challenge with a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, mice expressing human ACE2 and immunized with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 show profoundly reduced viral infection and inflammation in the lung indicating protection against pneumonia. Finally, passive transfer of sera from VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-immunized animals protects naive mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

SARS-CoV-2 has made the leap from animals to humans, but little is known about variations in species susceptibility that could identify potential reservoir species, animal models, and the risk to pets, wildlife, and livestock. While there is evidence that certain species, such as cats, are susceptible, the vast majority of animal species, including those in close contact with humans, have unknown susceptibility. Hence, methods to predict their infection risk are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critical for viral cell entry and infection. Here we identified key ACE2 residues that distinguish susceptible from resistant species using in-depth sequence and structural analyses of ACE2 and its binding to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings have important implications for identification of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 residues for therapeutic targeting and identification of animal species with increased susceptibility for infection on which to focus research and protection measures for environmental and public health.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew R Alexander","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Clara T.

We show that pDC are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, they efficiently diversified into activated P1-, P2-, and P3-pDC effector subsets in response to viral stimulation. They expressed checkpoint molecules at levels similar to influenza virus-induced activation. They rapidly produced high levels of interferon-, interferon-{lambda}1, IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8. Importantly, all major aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation were inhibited by hydroxychloroquine, including P2- and P3-pDC differentiation, the expression of maturation markers, and the production of interferon- and inflammatory cytokines. Our results indicate that pDC may represent a major player in the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and call for caution in the use of hydroxychloroquine in the early treatment of the disease.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fanny Onodi","author_inst":"INSERM U976"},{"author_name":"Lucie Bonnet-Madin","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"L\u00e9a Karpf","author_inst":"INSERM U976"},{"author_name":"Laurent Meertens","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Justine Poirot","author_inst":"INSERM U976"},{"author_name":"Jer\u00f4me LeGoff","author_inst":"Paris Diderot University and APHP - H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis"},{"author_name":"Constance Delaugerre","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Ali AMARA","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Vassili Soumelis","author_inst":"INSERM U976"},{"author_name":"Meena S.

To address this, we applied single-cell profiling to bronchoalveolar lavages from 44 patients with mild or critical COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia as control. Viral RNA-tracking delineated the infection phenotype to epithelial cells, but positioned mainly neutrophils at the forefront of viral clearance activity during COVID-19. In mild disease, neutrophils could execute their antiviral function in an immunologically  controlled fashion, regulated by fully-differentiated T-helper-17 (TH17)-cells, as well as T-helper-1 (TH1)-cells, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and partially-exhausted (TEX) T-cells with good effector functions. This was paralleled by  orderly phagocytic disposal of dead\/stressed cells by fully-differentiated macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, hence facilitating lung tissue repair. In critical disease, CD4+ TH1- and CD8+ TEX-cells were characterized by inflammation-associated stress and metabolic exhaustion, while CD4+ TH17- and CD8+ TRM-cells failed to differentiate. Consequently, T-cell effector function was largely impaired thereby possibly facilitating excessive neutrophil-based inflammation. This was accompanied by impaired monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, with monocytes exhibiting an ATP-purinergic signalling-inflammasome footprint, thereby enabling COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsening disease severity. Our work represents a major resource for understanding the lung-localised immunity and inflammation landscape during COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Els Wauters","author_inst":"Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and Thoracic Surgery (BREATHE), Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Van Mol","author_inst":"VIB Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium; Laboratory of Translational Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium;"},{"author_name":"Abhishek D.

Genomic technologies have enabled us to understand the genomic constitution of the pathogens, their virulence, evolution, rate of mutations, etc. To date, more than 60,000 virus genomes have been deposited in the public depositories like GISAID and NCBI. While we are writing this, India is the 3rd most-affected country with COVID-19 with 0.6 million cases, and >18000 deaths. Gujarat is the fourth highest affected state with 5.44 percent death rate compared to national average of 2.8 percent.\n\nHere, 361 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Gujarat have been sequenced and analyzed in order to understand its phylogenetic distribution and variants against global and national sequences. Further, variants were analyzed from diseased and recovered patients from Gujarat and the World to understand its role in pathogenesis. From missense mutations, found from Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 genomes, C28854T, deleterious mutation in nucleocapsid (N) gene was found to be significantly associated with mortality in patients. The other significant deleterious variant found in diseased patients from Gujarat and the world is G25563T, which is located in Orf3a and has a potential role in viral pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Gujarat are forming distinct cluster under GH clade of GISAID.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Madhvi Joshi","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Apurvasinh C Puvar","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Dinesh Kumar","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Afzal Ansari","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Maharshi Pandya","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Janvi Raval","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Zarna Patel","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Pinal Trivedi","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Monika Gandhi","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Labdhi Pandya","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Komal Patel","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Nitin Savaliya","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Snehal Bagatharia","author_inst":"Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission"},{"author_name":"Sachin Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya Joshi","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Christophe Dooms","author_inst":"Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and Thoracic Surgery (BREATHE), Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Jan Gunst","author_inst":"Laboratory of Intensive Care Medicine, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Greet Hermans","author_inst":"Laboratory of Intensive Care Medicine, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Philippe Meersseman","author_inst":"Laboratory for Clinical Infectious and Inflammatory Disorders, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Dries Testelmans","author_inst":"Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and Thoracic Surgery (BREATHE), Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Jonas Yserbyt","author_inst":"Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and Thoracic Surgery (BREATHE), Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Patrick Matthys","author_inst":"Laboratory of Immunobiology, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Sabine Tejpar","author_inst":"Molecular Digestive Oncology, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"- CONTAGIOUS collaborators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Johan Neyts","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Joost Wauters","author_inst":"Laboratory for Clinical Infectious and Inflammatory Disorders, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Junbin Qian","author_inst":"Laboratory of Translational Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium;  VIB Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Diether Lambrechts","author_inst":"Laboratory of Translational Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium; VIB Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.194498","rel_title":"Robust three-dimensional expansion of human adult alveolar stem cells and SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.194498","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of a present global pandemic, infects human lung alveolar cells (hACs).

Here, we develop a feeder-free, long-term three-dimensional (3D) culture technique for human alveolar type 2 (hAT2) cells, and investigate infection response to SARS-CoV-2. By imaging-based analysis and single-cell transcriptome profiling, we reveal rapid viral replication and the increased expression of interferon-associated genes and pro-inflammatory genes in infected hAT2 cells, indicating robust endogenous innate immune response. Further tracing of viral mutations acquired during transmission identifies full infection of individual cells effectively from a single viral entry. Our study provides deep insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and the application of long-term 3D hAT2 cultures as models for respiratory diseases.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeonghwan Youk","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Taewoo Kim","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Young-Il Jeong","author_inst":"Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yongsuk Hur","author_inst":"Korea Advanced institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Seon Pyo Hong","author_inst":"Korea Advanced institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Je Hyoung Kim","author_inst":"Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kijong Yi","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Su Yeon Kim","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kwon Joong Na","author_inst":"Seoul National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thomas Bleazard","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Ho Min Kim","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Natasha Ivory","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Krishnaa T.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among viral RNAs in its vast potential to form stable RNA structures and yet, as much as 97% of its 30 kilobases have not been structurally explored in the context of a viral infection. Our limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 genomic architecture is a fundamental limitation to both our mechanistic understanding of coronavirus life cycle and the development of COVID-19 RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we apply a novel long amplicon strategy to determine for the first time the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome probed in infected cells. In addition to the conserved structural motifs at the viral termini, we report new structural features like a conformationally flexible programmed ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot, and a host of novel RNA structures, each of which highlights the importance of studying viral structures in their native genomic context. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals extensive networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals new aspects of SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from other single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Evolutionary analysis of RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 shows that several features of its genomic structure are conserved across beta coronaviruses and we pinpoint individual regions of well-folded RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis. The native, complete secondary structure of SAR-CoV-2 presented here is a roadmap that will facilitate focused studies on mechanisms of replication, translation and packaging, and guide the identification of new RNA drug targets against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas C Huston","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Han Wan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Rafael de Cesaris Araujo Tavares","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Craig B Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anna Marie Pyle","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Je Hyoung Kim","author_inst":"Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kijong Yi","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Su Yeon Kim","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kwon Joong Na","author_inst":"Seoul National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thomas Bleazard","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Ho Min Kim","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Natasha Ivory","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Krishnaa T.

Due to intrinsic instability typical of class I fusion proteins, S tends to prematurely refold to the post-fusion conformation, compromising immunogenic properties and prefusion trimer yields. To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers, with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify two regions in the S-protein critical for the proteins stability: the heptad repeat region 1 of the S2 subunit and subunit domain 1 at the interface with S2. We combined a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain. The cryo-EM structure reveals a correctly folded, predominantly closed pre-fusion conformation. Highly stable and well producing S protein and the increased understanding of S protein structure will support vaccine development and serological diagnostics.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jarek Juraszek","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lucy Rutten","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Sven Blokland","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Pascale Bouchier","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Richard Voorzaat","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tina Ritschel","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mark J.G.

Prediction results suggest that mutation D614G in the virus spike protein, which has attracted much attention from researchers, is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. Based on 6,324 viral genome sequences, we create a spreadsheet dataset of point mutations that can facilitate the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in many perspectives, especially in tracing the evolution and worldwide spread of the virus.

Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume fast mixing of the population relative to the local infection rate, similar to the regime applicable to many chemical reactions. However, in human populations, especially under different levels of quarantine conditions, this assumption is likely to fail. We develop a continuous spatial model that includes five different populations, in which the infectious population is split into latent (or pre-symptomatic) and symptomatic. Based on nearest-neighbor infection kinetics, we arrive into a ``reaction-diffusion'' model. Our model accounts for front propagation of the infectious population domains under partial quarantine conditions, which is present on top of the common local infection process. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. Our results demonstrate how infected domains spread outward from epicenters\/hotspots, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (quasi linear or power-law) growth. Moreover, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the center of the populated area. Predicted heat-maps show remarkable similarity to recently media released heat-maps. We further demonstrate how localized strong quarantine conditions can prevent the spreading of the disease from an epicenter\/hotspot, significantly reducing the number of infected people. Application of our model in different countries, using actual demographic data and infectious disease parameters, can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localized areas.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yoav Tsori","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Rony Granek","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Thin Nguyen","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Henry Nguyen","author_inst":"Griffith University"},{"author_name":"Asim Bhatti","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Dinh C.

Design: This is an analysis of count data that has been collected by the onboard clinic up to the 20th February 2020. Symptomatic infection rates during the quarantine period in cabins with previous confirmed cases are compared to these in cabins without previous confirmed cases. Results: Symptomatic infection rate during the quarantine period in cabins with previously confirmed cases is not significantly higher than that in cabins without previously confirmed cases. Age does not appear to be a cofounder. Conclusions: Airborne transmission of COVID-19 through the ventilation system onboard could explain the virus spread into cabins during the quarantine period.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Orouba Almilaji","author_inst":"Bournemouth University"},{"author_name":"Peter Thomas","author_inst":"Bournemouth University"},{"author_name":"Fawatim Al-Nahwi","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Ahsa, Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Heba Al-Ameer","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Ahsa, Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Sameer Al-Abdi","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Ahsa, Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Dinh C.

KN95 respirators and N95 decontamination protocols have been described as solutions to a lack of such PPE. However, there are a few materials science studies that characterize the charge distribution and physical changes accompanying disinfection treatments particularly heating. Here, we report the filtration efficiency, dipole charge density, and fiber integrity of pristine N95 and KN95 respirators before and after various decontamination methods. We found that the filter layer of N95 is 8-fold thicker than that of KN95, which explains its 10% higher filtration efficiency (97.03 %) versus KN95 (87.76 %) under pristines condition. After 60 minutes of 70 {degrees}C treatment, the filtration efficiency and dipole charge density of N95 became 97.16% and 12.48 {micro}C\/m2, while those of KN95 were 83.64% and 1.48 {micro}C\/m2 ; moreover, fit factor of N95 was 55 and that of KN95 was 2.7. In conclusion, the KN95 respirator is an inferior alternative of N95 respirator. In both systems, a loss of electrostatic charge does not directly correlate to a decrease in performance.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wonjun Yim","author_inst":"University of California Sandiego"},{"author_name":"Diyi Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Sandiego"},{"author_name":"Shiv Patel","author_inst":"University of California Sandiego"},{"author_name":"Rui Kui","author_inst":"University of California Sandiego"},{"author_name":"Ying Shirley Meng","author_inst":"University of California Sandiego"},{"author_name":"Jesse V.

Methods Based on systematic search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct up to April 22, 2020, a total of 52 eligible articles with 6,320 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cohorts were included. Pairwise comparison between severe versus mild disease, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) versus general ward admission, and expired versus survivors were performed for 36 laboratory parameters. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the DerSimonian Laird method\/random effects model and converted to Odds ratio (OR). The decision tree algorithm was employed to identify the key risk factor(s) attributed to severe COVID-19 disease. Results Cohorts with elevated levels of white blood cells (WBCs) (OR=1.75), neutrophil count (OR=2.62), D-dimer (OR=3.97), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (OR=1.82), fibrinogen (OR=3.14), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR=1.60), procalcitonin (OR=4.76), IL-6 (OR=2.10), and IL-10 (OR=4.93) had higher odds of progression to severe phenotype. Decision tree model (sensitivity=100%, specificity=81%) showed the high performance of neutrophil count at a cut-off value of more than 3.74 x109\/L for identifying patients at high risk of severe COVID-19. Likewise, ICU admission was associated with higher levels of WBCs (OR=5.21), neutrophils (OR=6.25), D-dimer (OR=4.19), and prolonged PT (OR=2.18). Patients with high IL-6 (OR=13.87), CRP (OR=7.09), D-dimer (OR=6.36), and neutrophils (OR=6.25) had the highest likelihood of mortality. Conclusions Several hematological and immunological markers, in particular neutrophilic count, could be helpful to be included within the routine panel for COVID-19 infection evaluation to ensure risk stratification and effective management.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rami M Elshazli","author_inst":"Horus University - Egypt"},{"author_name":"Eman Ali Toraih","author_inst":"Tulane Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Abdelaziz Elgaml","author_inst":"Mansoura University and Horus University - Egypt"},{"author_name":"Mohammed El-Mowafy","author_inst":"Mansoura University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed El-Mesery","author_inst":"Mansoura University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed N Amin","author_inst":"Mansoura University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad H Hussein","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Mary T Killackey","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Manal S Fawzy","author_inst":"Suez Canal University"},{"author_name":"Emad Kandil","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Ho Min Kim","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Natasha Ivory","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Krishnaa T.

Early identification of risk factors and clinical outcomes might help to identify critically ill patients, provide proper treatment and prevent mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective study in patients with flu-like symptoms referred to the imaging department of a tertiary hospital in IRAN between 3 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. Patients with COVID-19 were followed up to check their health condition after two months. The categorical data between groups were analyzed by Fisher exact test and continuous data by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Findings: 319 patients (mean age 45.48 years, 177 women) were enrolled. Fever, dyspnea, weakness, shivering, C-reactive protein (CRP), fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, sweating and age were the most important symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Traveling in past three months, asthma, taking corticosteroids, liver disease, rheumatological disease, cough with sputum, eczema, conjunctivitis, tobacco use, and chest pain did not have any relationship with COVID-19. Interpretation: Finding clinical symptoms for early diagnosis of COVID-19 is a critical part of prevention. These symptoms can help in the assessment of disease progression. To the best of our knowledge, some of the effective features on the mortality due to COVID-19 are investigated for the first time in this research.

The purpose of present study is to develop and apply a computational tool for predicting evolution of different epidemiological variables for COVID-19 in India. We propose a dynamic SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead) and SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) model for this purpose. In the dynamic model, time dependent infection rate is assumed for estimating evolution of different variables of the model. Parameter estimation of the model is the first step of the analysis which is performed by least square optimization of priori data. In the second step of the analysis, simulation is carried out by using evaluated parameters for prediction of the outbreak. The computational model has been validated against real data for COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Time to reach peak, peak infected cases and total reported cases were compared with actual data and found to be in very good agreement. Next the model is applied for the case of India and various Indian states to predict different epidemiological parameters. Priori data was taken from the beginning of nation-wide lockdown on 24 March to 6 July. It was found that peak of the outbreak may reach in the month of August-September with maximum 4-5 lakhs active cases at peak.

Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. Results: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death. Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, gastrointestinal symptoms and liver test abnormalities were common but the majority were mild and their presence was not associated with a more severe clinical course.","rel_num_authors":121,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B.

The therapy has been deemed safe and several clinical trials assessing its efficacy are ongoing. While it remains to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in the efficacy of this treatment. Indeed, neutralizing titers of [&ge;]1:160 have been recommended in some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here we performed repeated analyses at one-month interval on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, including neutralization, evolve over time. We observed that receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG slightly decreased between six and ten weeks after symptoms onset but RBD-specific IgM decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing SARS-CoV-2 S wild-type or its D614G variant. If neutralization activity proves to be an important factor in the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma transfer, our results suggest that plasma from convalescent donors should be recovered rapidly after symptoms resolution.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussi\u00e8res","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Laumaea","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"},{"author_name":"Sai Priya Anand","author_inst":"CRCHUM \/ McGill"},{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Pr\u00e9vost","author_inst":"CRCHUM \/ Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"},{"author_name":"Romain Gasser","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Goyette","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Halima Medjahed","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9ee Perreault","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Tony Tremblay","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Antoine Lewin","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Laurie Gokool","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Chantal Morrisseau","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Philippe B\u00e9gin","author_inst":"CHU Ste-Justine"},{"author_name":"Cecile Tremblay","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Val\u00e9rie Martel-Laferri\u00e8re","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Richard","author_inst":"Centre de Recherche du CHUM"},{"author_name":"Ren\u00e9e Bazin","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Andr\u00e9s Finzi","author_inst":"CRCHUM, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"},{"author_name":"Liam G.

Here we show that the human B cell compartment in patients with diagnostically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and clinical COVID-19 is rapidly altered with the early recruitment of B cells expressing a limited subset of IGHV genes, progressing to a highly polyclonal response of B cells with broader IGHV gene usage and extensive class switching to IgG and IgA subclasses with limited somatic hypermutation in the initial weeks of infection. We identify extensive convergence of antibody sequences across SARS-CoV-2 patients, highlighting stereotyped naive responses to this virus. Notably, sequence-based detection in COVID-19 patients of convergent B cell clonotypes previously reported in SARS-CoV infection predicts the presence of SARS-CoV\/SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibody titers specific for the receptor-binding domain. These findings offer molecular insights into shared features of human B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic spillover coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sandra Cathrine Abel Nielsen","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Fan Yang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Katherine JL Jackson","author_inst":"Garvan Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Ramona A.

To achieve this goal, it is important to identify surrogates of immune protection, namely, CoV-2 MHC Class I and II immunodominant pieces\/epitopes and methodologies to measure them. Here, we present results of flow cytometry-based MHC Class I and II QuickSwitch platforms for assessing SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding affinities to various human alleles as well as the H-2 Kb mouse allele. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 potential MHC binders were screened and validated by QuickSwitch testing. While several predicted peptides with acceptable theoretical Kd showed poor MHC occupancies, fourteen MHC class II and a few MHC class I peptides showed promiscuity in that they bind with multiple MHC molecule types. With the peptide exchange generated MHC tetramers, scientists can assess CD4+ and CD8+ immune responses to these different MHC\/peptide complexes. Results obtained with several SARS-CoV-2 MHC class I and II peptides are included and discussed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuri Poluektov","author_inst":"MBL International"},{"author_name":"Pirouz Daftarian","author_inst":"JSR Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Marc C Delcommenne","author_inst":"MBL International"},{"author_name":"Ramona A.

We recently reported an exceptionally potent NAb, BD-368-2, and revealed the existence of VH3-53\/VH3-66 convergent NAbs in COVID-19. Here we report the 3.5-[A] cryo-EM structure of BD-368-2s Fabs in complex with a mutation-induced prefusion-state-stabilized spike trimer. Unlike VH3-53\/VH3-66 NAbs, BD-368-2 fully blocks ACE2 binding by occupying all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) simultaneously, regardless of their \"up\" and \"down\" positions. BD-368-2 also triggers fusogenic-like structural rearrangements of the spike trimer, which could impede viral entry. Moreover, BD-368-2 completely avoids the common epitope of VH3-53\/VH3-66 NAbs, evidenced by multiple crystal structures of their Fabs in tripartite complexes with RBD, suggesting a new way of pairing potent NAbs to prevent neutralization escape. Together, these results rationalize a unique epitope that leads to exceptional neutralization potency, and provide guidance for NAb therapeutics and vaccine designs against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuo Du","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yunlong Cao","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qinyu Zhu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Guopeng Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxia Du","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Runsheng He","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Hua Xu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yinghui Zheng","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yali Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Chenggong Ji","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Ayijiang Yisimayi","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ning Gao","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Sunney Xie","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-dong Su","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Junyu Xiao","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Peter S.

Country-, state\/region- and possibly even city-private variant profiles may contribute to varied disease exemplifications and fatality rates observed across the globe along with host factors such as age, ethnicity and comorbidity. The Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) captures up-to-date fulllength SARS-CoV-2 sequences of ~50,500 isolates from GISAID, GenBank, CHLA Center for Personalized Medicine, and other sources (as of June 18, 2020). Among which, 49,637 isolates carry at least one variation from the reference genome NC_045512, a total of 6,070 variants and 2,513 haplotypes were detected in at least three isolates independently. Together, they constituted the most likely SARS-CoV-2 variant and haplotype landscapes world-wide currently.\n\nEvidence supporting positive (orf3a, orf8, S genes) and purifying (M gene) selections were detected, which warrants further investigation. Most interestingly, we identified 1,583 countryprivate variants from 10,238 isolates (20.6% overall) reported in 48 countries. 807 countryprivate haplotypes, defined as a haplotype shared by at least 5 isolates all of which came from the same country, were identified in in 8,656 isolates from 39 countries. United Kingdom, USA, and Australia had 464, 166 and 32 private haplotypes respectively, comprising 22.4%, 16.6% and 16.4% of the isolates from each country. Together with their descendent and private haplotypes with fewer members, 22,171 (45.8%) isolates carried country-private haplotypes globally. The percentage were 28.2-29.6% in January to March, and rapidly increased to 46.4% and 59.6% in April and May, co-occurring with global travel restrictions. The localization of the variant profiles appeared to be similarly accelerating from 14.2% in March and 28.4% in April to over 40% isolates carrying the country-private variants around May.\n\nIn summary, a common pattern is seen world-wide in COVID-19 in which at the onset of disease there appeared to be a significant number of SARS-CoV-2 variants that accumulate quickly and then begin to rapidly coalesce into distinct haplotypes. This may be the result of localized outbreaks due to factors such as multiple points viral introduction, geographic separation and the introduction of policies such as travel restriction, social distancing and quarantine, resulting in the emergence of country-private haplotypes.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuo Du","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yunlong Cao","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qinyu Zhu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Guopeng Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxia Du","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Runsheng He","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Hua Xu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yinghui Zheng","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yali Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Chenggong Ji","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Ayijiang Yisimayi","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ning Gao","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Sunney Xie","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-dong Su","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Junyu Xiao","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Peter S.
