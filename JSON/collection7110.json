It is shown that the model exhibits a backward bifurcation at R0 = 1 when recovered individuals do not develop a permanent immunity for the disease. In the absence of reinfection, it is proved that the model is without backward bifurcation and the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for R0 < 1. By using available data, the model is validated and parameter values are estimated. The sensitivity of the value of R0 to changes in any of the parameter values involved in its formula is analysed. Moreover, various mitigation strategies are investigated using the proposed model and it is observed that the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals may play a major role in the re-emergence of the disease in the future. Therefore, it is recommended that in the absence of vaccination, countries need to develop capacities to detect and isolate at least 30% of the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals while treating in isolation at least 50% of symptomatic patients to control the disease.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Semu Kassa","author_inst":"Botswana International University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hatson John Boscoh Njagarah","author_inst":"Botswana International University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yibeltal Adane Terefe","author_inst":"University of Limpopo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20066613","rel_title":"Meteorological factors and domestic new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities: A time-series analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20066613","rel_abs":"AIM To investigate the associations of meteorological factors and the daily new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities. METHOD Pearson correlation and generalized additive modeling were performed to assess the relationships between daily new COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative humidity) with the most updated data currently available. RESULTS The Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were more correlated with the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated with the average temperature in Beijing (r=-0.565, P<0.01), Shanghai (r=-0.471, P<0.01), and Guangzhou (r=-0.530, P<0.01) , yet in contrast, positively correlated with that in Japan (r=0.441, P<0.01). In most of the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), generalized additive modeling analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases was positively associated with both average temperature and relative humidity, especially in lagged 3d model, where a positive influence of temperature on the daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities except in Beijing, Wuhan, Korea, and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent across cities and lagged time, suggesting meteorological factors were unlikely to greatly influence the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION The associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and lagged time. Large-scale public health measures and expanded regional research are still required until a vaccine becomes available and herd immunity is established.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zonglin He","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Yiqiao Chin","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Jian Huang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yi He","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Babatunde O.

We assessed if social isolation and loneliness increase the risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (ICD-10: I00-I99) and used the data to create a conceptual framework. Using the 10-year overall and cardiovascular mortality follow-up data (n = 12,019) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2008), we conducted survival analyses and found that individuals who experience social isolation or loneliness have a significantly higher likelihood of overall and CVD mortality than those without support.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antiviral, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by Rc), is less than unity. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy greater than or equal to 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19. Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Calistus N Ngonghala","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Enahoro Iboi","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Steffen Eikenberry","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Scotch","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Chandini Raina MacIntyre","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Matthew H Bonds","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Abba B Gumel","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Wai-kit Ming","author_inst":"Jinan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065896","rel_title":"Significantly longer Covid-19 incubation times for the elderly, from a case study of 136 patients throughout China","rel_date":"2020-04-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065896","rel_abs":"Objective: To infer Covid19 incubation time distribution from a large sample. Method: Based on individual case data published online by 21 cities of China, we investigated a total of 136 COVID19 patients who traveled to Hubei from 21 cities of China between January 5 and January 31, 2020, remained there for 48 hours or less, and returned to these cities with onset of symptoms between January 10 and February 6, 2020. Among these patients, 110 were found to be aged 15 to 64, 22 aged 65 to 86, and 4 aged under 15. Findings: The differential incubation time histogram of the two age groups 15 to 64 and 65 to 86 are adequately fitted by the log normal model. For the 15 to 64 age group, the median incubation time of 7.00+1.10 - 0.9 days (uncertainties are 95 % CL) is broadly consistent with previous literature. For the 65-86 age group, the median is 10.9+2.7 - 2.0 days is statistically significantly longer. Moreover, for this group, the 95 % confidence contour indicates the data cannot constrain the upper bound of the log normal parameters , {sigma} by failing to close there; this is because the sample has a maximum incubation time of 17 days, beyond which we ran out of data even though the histogram has not yet peaked. Thus there is the potential of a much longer incubation time for the 65 to 86 age group than 10 to 14 days. Only a much larger sample can settle this.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ally Bi-zhu Jiang","author_inst":"Shenzhen RAK wireless Technology Co., Ltd., China"},{"author_name":"Richard Lieu","author_inst":"Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Alabama in Huntsville,  Huntsville, AL 35899, USA"},{"author_name":"Siobhan Quenby","author_inst":"Division of Reproductive Health, Warwick Medical School, The University of Warwick, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthew Scotch","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Chandini Raina MacIntyre","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Matthew H Bonds","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Abba B Gumel","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Wai-kit Ming","author_inst":"Jinan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20066431","rel_title":"Estimating the early death toll of COVID-19 in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20066431","rel_abs":"Background Efforts to track the severity and public health impact of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, in the US have been hampered by testing issues, reporting lags, and inconsistency between states. Evaluating unexplained increases in deaths attributed to broad outcomes, such as pneumonia and influenza (P&I) or all causes, can provide a more complete and consistent picture of the burden caused by COVID-19. Methods We evaluated increases in the occurrence of deaths due to P&I above a seasonal baseline (adjusted for influenza activity) or due to any cause across the United States in February and March 2020. These estimates are compared with reported deaths due to COVID-19 and with testing data. Results There were notable increases in the rate of death due to P&I in February and March 2020. In a number of states, these deaths pre-dated increases in COVID-19 testing rates and were not counted in official records as related to COVID-19. There was substantial variability between states in the discrepancy between reported rates of death due to COVID-19 and the estimated burden of excess deaths due to P&I. The increase in all-cause deaths in New York and New Jersey is 1.5-3 times higher than the official tally of COVID-19 confirmed deaths or the estimated excess death due to P&I. Conclusions Excess P&I deaths provide a conservative estimate of COVID-19 burden and indicate that COVID-19-related deaths are missed in locations with inadequate testing or intense pandemic activity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Weinberger","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ted Cohen","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Forrest Crawford","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Farzad Mostashari","author_inst":"Aledade, Inc"},{"author_name":"Don Olson","author_inst":"Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York City, NY"},{"author_name":"Virginia E Pitzer","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts"},{"author_name":"Marcus Russi","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lone Simonsen","author_inst":"Department of Science and Environment, Roskilde University, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Annie Watkins","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20066720","rel_title":"Digital Herd Immunity and COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20066720","rel_abs":"A population can be immune to epidemics even if not all of its individual members are immune to the disease, just as long as sufficiently many are immune - this is the traditional notion of herd immunity. In the smartphone era a population can be immune to epidemics even if not a single one of its members is immune to the disease - a notion we propose to call \"digital herd immunity\", which is similarly an emergent characteristic of the population. This immunity arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune phase. As usage decreases there is a novel \"contact tracing\" phase transition to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the proportion of non-symptomatic transmission.

With only 536 COVID-19 cases and 11 fatalities, India - a democracy of 1.34 billion people - took the historic decision of a 21-day national lockdown on March 25. The lockdown was further extended to May 3, soon after the analysis of this paper was completed. Objective: To study the short- and long-term impact of an initial 21-day lockdown on the total number of COVID-19 cases in India compared to other less severe non-pharmaceutical interventions using epidemiological forecasting models and Bayesian estimation algorithms; to compare effects of hypothetical durations of lockdown from an epidemiological perspective; to study alternative explanations for slower growth rate of the virus outbreak in India, including exploring the association of the number of cases and average monthly temperature; and finally, to outline the pivotal role of reliable and transparent data, reproducible data science methods, tools and products as we reopen the country and prepare for a post lock-down phase of the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: We use the daily data on the number of COVID-19 cases, of recovered and of deaths from March 1 until April 7, 2020 from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Additionally, we use COVID-19 incidence counts data from Kaggle and the monthly average temperature of major cities across the world from Wikipedia. Main Outcome and Measures: The current time-series data on daily proportions of cases and removed (recovered and death combined) from India are analyzed using an extended version of the standard SIR (susceptible, infected, and removed) model. The eSIR model incorporates time-varying transmission rates that help us predict the effect of lockdown compared to other hypothetical interventions on the number of cases at future time points. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation of this model provided predicted proportions of the cases at future time points along with credible intervals (CI). Results: Our predicted cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in India on April 30 assuming a 1-week delay in people's adherence to a 21-day lockdown (March 25 - April 14) and a gradual, moderate resumption of daily activities after April 14 is 9,181 with upper 95% CI of 72,245. In comparison, the predicted cumulative number of cases under \"no intervention\" and \"social distancing and travel bans without lockdown\" are 358 thousand and 46 thousand (upper 95% CI of nearly 2.3 million and 0.3 million) respectively. An effective lockdown can prevent roughly 343 thousand (upper 95% CI 1.8 million) and 2.4 million (upper 95% CI 38.4 million) COVID-19 cases nationwide compared to social distancing alone by May 15 and June 15, respectively. When comparing a 21-day lockdown with a hypothetical lockdown of longer duration, we find that 28-, 42-, and 56-day lockdowns can approximately prevent 238 thousand (upper 95% CI 2.3 million), 622 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.3 million), 781 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.6 million) cases by June 15, respectively. We find some suggestive evidence that the COVID-19 incidence rates worldwide are negatively associated with temperature in a crude unadjusted analysis with Pearson correlation estimates [95% confidence interval] between average monthly temperature and total monthly incidence around the world being -0.185 [-0.548, 0.236] for January, -0.110 [-0.362, 0.157] for February, and -0.173 [-0.314, -0.026] for March. Conclusions and Relevance: The lockdown, if implemented correctly in the end, has a high chance of reducing the total number of COVID-19 cases in the short term, and buy India invaluable time to prepare its healthcare and disease monitoring system. Our analysis shows we need to have some measures of suppression in place after the lockdown for the best outcome. We cannot heavily rely on the hypothetical prevention governed by meteorological factors such as temperature based on current evidence. From an epidemiological perspective, a longer lockdown between 42-56 days is preferable. However, the lockdown comes at a tremendous price to social and economic health through a contagion process not dissimilar to that of the coronavirus itself. Data can play a defining role as we design post-lockdown testing, reopening and resource allocation strategies. Software: Our contribution to data science includes an interactive and dynamic app (covind19.org) with short- and long-term projections updated daily that can help inform policy and practice related to COVID-19 in India. Anyone can visualize the observed data for India and create predictions under hypothetical scenarios with quantification of uncertainties. We make our prediction codes freely available (https:\/\/github.com\/umich-cphds\/cov-ind-19) for reproducible science and for other COVID-19 affected countries to use them for their prediction and data visualization work.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Debashree Ray","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Salvatore","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Rupam Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Shariq Mohammed","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Soumik Purkayastha","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Aritra Halder","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Alexander Rix","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Daniel Barker","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Michael Kleinsasser","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yiwang Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Peter Song","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Debraj Bose","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Mousumi Banerjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Parikshit Ghosh","author_inst":"Delhi School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20066811","rel_title":"Estimating the COVID-19 Infection Rate: Anatomy of an Inference Problem","rel_date":"2020-04-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20066811","rel_abs":"As a consequence of missing data on tests for infection and imperfect accuracy of tests, reported rates of cumulative population infection by the SARS CoV-2 virus are lower than actual rates of infection.

Methods: We simulate partial unlock of social distancing for epidemics over a range of replication factor, immunity duration and seasonality factor for strategies targeting immunity thresholds using overshoot optimization. Results: Seasonality change must be taken into account as one of the steps in an easing sequence, and a two step unlock, including seasonal effects, minimizes overshoot and deaths. It may cause undershoot, which causes rebounds and assists survival of the pathogen. Conclusions: Partial easing levels, even low levels for economic relief while waiting on a vaccine, have population immunity thresholds based on the reduced replication rates and may experience overshoot as well. We further find a two step strategy remains highly sensitive to variations in case ratio, replication factor, seasonality and timing. We demonstrate a three or more step strategy is more robust, and conclude that the best possible approach minimizes deaths under a range of likely actual conditions which include public response.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert L Shuler","author_inst":"Shuler Research (former NASA JSC)"},{"author_name":"Theodore Koukouvitis","author_inst":"Shuler Research"},{"author_name":"Dyske Suematsu","author_inst":"Shuler Research"},{"author_name":"Jamie Young","author_inst":"Academic department of Medical genetics"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease"},{"author_name":"Mailis Maes","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Joana Pereira-Dias","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England Diagnostic Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthew Routledge","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Rivett","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Michael Weekes","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Martin Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England Diagnostic Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

The course of pandemic evolution has shown great differences among countries and not much is yet known about the level of generated immunity, which might appear not to be long-lasting. In this situation, management of a recurrent disease seems to be a plausible scenario that countries worldwide will have to face, before effective drugs or a vaccine appear. Spain in Europe, appears to be the first country deciding to partly lift the strict social distancing regulations imposed. Whether this action may lead to further epidemic recrudescence, to a following second wave of cases or conversely, help return to previous normality, is a subject of great debate and interest to all other countries affected by COVID-19. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we had also incorporated effects of social confinement. We now modify this previous model configuration to mimic potential post-confinement scenarios, by simulating from instant massive liberation of different portions of the confined population, up to a more gradual incorporation of people to work. Results show how current lockdown conditions should be extended at least two weeks more to prevent a new escalation in cases and deaths, as well as a larger second wave occurring in just a few months. Conversely, best-case scenario in terms of lower COVID-19 incidence and casualties should gradually incorporate workers back in a daily proportion at most 30 percent higher than that of previous confinement. The former should begin not earlier than by the end of April and it would represent approximately 600 thousand people or a 3.75% rate for the whole of Spain.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonardo Lopez","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Xavier Rodo","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Brian Summa","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Bihe Hu","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Carola Wenk","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Aibek Akmatbekov","author_inst":"LSU Health Sciences Center - New Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jack L Harbert","author_inst":"LSU Health Sciences Center - New Orleans"},{"author_name":"Richard S.

A comparison of antibody profiles detected on the array from control sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic versus convalescent blood specimens from virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrates near complete discrimination of these two groups, with improved performance from use of antigen combinations that include both spike protein and nucleoprotein.

We include the timing of each state's implementation of interventions including encouraging social distancing, closing schools, banning public events, and a lockdown \/ stay-at-home order. We assume fatalities are reported correctly and infer the number and timing of infections based on the infection fatality rate measured in populations that were tested universally for SARS-CoV-2.

This gene is most well known for its role in regulating blood pressure. But in recent times, its drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community because it may also serve as a doorway of sorts, enabling viruses like SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells. Our researchers looked at the ACE2 gene in more than 200,000 people, comparing their exact DNA sequences to see where there are differences among people. Variation in the DNA sequence of a gene is common and is sometimes meaningless. But other times, small changes in the DNA sequence can alter the protein that is made from that gene. In this case the ACE2 gene makes the ACE2 protein, which is what the SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with. We found a lot of variation between individuals and checked to see if that variation coincided with any traits (i.e., people with variant X tend to have high blood pressure more often than people without variant X). All of the traits we looked at were non-COVID-19-related traits, meaning we havent asked these people anything about COVID-19 yet (this is because these DNA sequences were collected before the pandemic).\n\nWe found that there are a number of variations observed among people in a specific part of the ACE2 gene. These variations are expected to alter the shape or functionality of a specific part of the ACE2 protein: The part that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We dont yet know what the real-life significance of this variation is, but its possible that these variants decrease the proteins ability to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thus decreasing the persons likelihood of being infected. We can speculate that there will be a spectrum of vulnerability to COVID-19 among people, where some people are more vulnerable than others, and that variants in this part of the ACE2 gene may be one of the reasons. The research we presented here shines a light on this part of the ACE2 gene and may give future researchers a direction to go in as they try to figure out what makes people vulnerable to COVID-19 and similar viruses.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth Trilby Cirulli","author_inst":"Human Longevity, Inc."},{"author_name":"Stephen Riffle","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolze","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Washington","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Jiin Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Joshua Miago Obiero","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Oluwasanmi Oladapo Adenaiye","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Sheldon Tai","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Filbert H Hong","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Philip Norris","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mars Stone","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Graham Simmons","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Anil Bagri","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Martin Schreiber","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Buser","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Holbro","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Philip Hosimer","author_inst":"Ortho Clinical Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Charles Noesen","author_inst":"Ortho Clinical Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Donald K Milton","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"- Prometheus Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Huw Davies","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Paul Contestable","author_inst":"Ortho Clinical Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Laurence M Corash","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Philip L Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063701","rel_title":"Initial stage of the COVID-19 infection process in human population","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063701","rel_abs":"The simplest approximation for the first stages of the infection spread is considered.

COVID-19-associated deaths are mainly attributed to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Recent work demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lung. To better understand ACE2 abundance and expression patterns in the lung we interrogated our in-house single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset containing 70,085 EPCAM+ lung epithelial cells from paired normal and lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a diverse repertoire of airway lineages that included alveolar type I and II, bronchioalveolar, club\/secretory, quiescent and proliferating basal, ciliated and malignant cells as well as rare populations such as ionocytes. While the fraction of lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 was low (1.7% overall), alveolar type II (AT2, 2.2% ACE2+) cells exhibited highest levels of ACE2 expression among all cell subsets. Further analysis of the AT2 compartment (n = 27,235 cells) revealed a number of genes co-expressed with ACE2 that are important for lung pathobiology including those associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; HHIP), pneumonia and infection (FGG and C4BPA) as well as malarial\/bacterial (CD36) and viral (DMBT1) scavenging which, for the most part, were increased in smoker versus light or non-smoker cells. Notably, DMBT1 was highly expressed in AT2 cells relative to other lung epithelial subsets and its expression positively correlated with ACE2. We describe a population of ACE2-positive AT2 cells that co-express pathogen (including viral) receptors (e.g. DMBT1) with crucial roles in host defense thus comprising plausible phenotypic targets for treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guangchun Han","author_inst":"Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Ansam Sinjab","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Warapen Treekitkarnmongkol","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Patrick Brennan","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Kieko Hara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Kyle Chang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Elena Bogatenkova","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Sanchez-Espiridion","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Carmen Behrens","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Boning Gao","author_inst":"Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Luc Girard","author_inst":"Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Boris Sepesi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Tina Cascone","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Lauren Byers","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Don L.

Rapidly increasing infections has raised intense worldwide attention. How to model the evolution of COVID-19 effectively and efficiently is of great significance for prevention and control. Methods: We propose the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model based on the original single-chain model in [8] to describe the evolution of COVID-19 in Singapore. Multi-chains can be considered as the superposition of several single chains with different characteristics. We identify parameters of models by minimizing the penalty function. Results: The numerical simulation results exhibit the multi-chain model performs well on data fitting. Though unsteady the increments are, they could still fall within the range of 25% fluctuation from simulation results. It is predicted by multi-chain models that Singapore are experiencing a nonnegligible risk of explosive outbreak, thus stronger measures are urgently needed to contain the epidemic. Conclusion: The multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model provides an effective way to early detect the appearance of imported infectors and super spreaders and forecast a second outbreak. It can also explain the data in those countries where the single-chain model shows deviation from the data.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanshuang Pan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Nian Shao","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yue Yan","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Luo","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Shufen Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ling Ye","author_inst":"Daishan County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Carmen Behrens","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Boning Gao","author_inst":"Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Luc Girard","author_inst":"Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Boris Sepesi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Tina Cascone","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Lauren Byers","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Don L.

As the pandemic progresses, information about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among humans is critical to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and\/or aerosols) between ferrets. Intranasal inoculation of donor ferrets resulted in a productive upper respiratory tract infection and long-term shedding, up to 11 to 19 days post-inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to four out of four direct contact ferrets between 1 and 3 days after exposure and via the air to three out of four independent indirect recipient ferrets between 3 and 7 days after exposure. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets was similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus was isolated from all positive animals, showing that ferrets were productively infected via either route. This study provides experimental evidence of robust transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the air, supporting the implementation of community-level social distancing measures currently applied in many countries in the world and informing decisions on infection control measures in healthcare settings 3.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mathilde Richard","author_inst":"ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Adinda Kok","author_inst":"ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Dennis de Meulder","author_inst":"ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Theo M.

Computed tomography (CT) has been widely used in the diagnosis of this novel pneumonia. This study aims to understand the role of CT for the diagnosis and the main imaging manifestations of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis on studies about the use of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We comprehensively searched databases and preprint servers on chest CT for patients with COVID-19 between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2020. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of chest CT imaging. We also conducted subgroup analyses and evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: A total of 104 studies with 5694 patients were included. Using RT-PCR results as reference, a meta-analysis based on 64 studies estimated the sensitivity of chest CT imaging in COVID-19 was 99% (95% CI, 0.97-1.00). If case reports were excluded, the sensitivity in case series was 96% (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). The sensitivity of CT scan in confirmed patients under 18 years old was only 66% (95% CI, 0.11-1.00). The most common imaging manifestation was ground-glass opacities (GGO) which was found in 75% (95% CI, 0.68-0.82) of the patients. The pooled probability of bilateral involvement was 84% (95% CI, 0.81-0.88). The most commonly involved lobes were the right lower lobe (84%, 95% CI, 0.78-0.90) and left lower lobe (81%, 95% CI, 0.74-0.87). The quality of evidence was low across all outcomes. Conclusions: In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that chest CT scan had a high sensitivity in diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, CT can potentially be used to assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meng Lv","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mengshu Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Nan Yang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Chen","author_inst":"Department of Radiology; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yunlan Liu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mengjuan Ren","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xianzhuo Zhang","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ling Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Junqiang Lei","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinhui Tian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jerry Shay","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"John V.

To date, more than 2.1 million confirmed cases and 139,500 deaths have been reported worldwide, and there are currently no medical countermeasures available to prevent or treat the disease. As the development of a vaccine could require at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline from hit finding to drug registration of an antiviral is >10 years, repositioning of known drugs can significantly accelerate the development and deployment of therapies for COVID-19. To identify therapeutics that can be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we profiled a library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or FDA-approved small molecules. Here, we report the identification of 30 known drugs that inhibit viral replication. Of these, six were characterized for cellular dose-activity relationships, and showed effective concentrations likely to be commensurate with therapeutic doses in patients. These include the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor Apilimod, cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334, and the CCR1 antagonist MLN-3897. Since many of these molecules have advanced into the clinic, the known pharmacological and human safety profiles of these compounds will accelerate their preclinical and clinical evaluation for COVID-19 treatment.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Riva","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Shuofeng Yuan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xin Yin","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Martin-Sancho","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Naoko Matsunaga","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Burgstaller","author_inst":"University of Vienna and Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Lars Pache","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Paul De Jesus","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Mitchell V.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) thought to have jumped species, from another mammal to humans. A pandemic caused by this virus is running rampant throughout the world. Thousands of cases of COVID-19 are reported in England and over 10,000 patients have died. Whilst there has been progress in managing this disease, it is not clear which factors, besides age, affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19. A recent analysis of COVID-19 in Italy identified links between air pollution and death rates. Here, we explored the correlation between three major air pollutants linked to fossil fuels and SARS-CoV-2 lethality in England. We compare up-to-date, real-time SARS-CoV-2 cases and death measurements from public databases to air pollution data monitored across over 120 sites in different regions. We found that the levels of some markers of poor air quality, nitrogen oxides and ozone, are associated with COVID-19 lethality in different English regions. We conclude that the levels of some air pollutants are linked to COVID-19 cases and morbidity. We suggest that our study provides a useful framework to guide health policy in countries affected by this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco Travaglio","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Yizhou Yu","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Rebeka Popovic","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Liza Selley","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nuno Santos Leal","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"L.

Currently, no effective vaccine is available to prevent COVID-19 and an intense global development activity is in progress. In this context, the different technology platforms face several challenges resulting from the involvement of a new virus still not fully characterised. Finding of the right conditions for virus amplification for the development of vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated whole viral particles is among them. Here, we describe the establishment of a workflow based on shotgun tandem mass spectrometry data to guide the optimisation of the conditions for viral amplification. In parallel, we analysed the dynamic of the host cell proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection providing a global overview of biological processes modulated by the virus and that could be further explored to identify drug targets to address the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia Grenga","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Gallais","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Olivier Pible","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean-Charles Gaillard","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Duarte Gouveia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Helene Batina","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Niza Bazaline","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Ruat","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Karen Culotta","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Guylaine Miotello","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Debroas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Marie-Anne Roncato","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Gerard Steinmetz","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Foissard","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Anne Desplan","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Alpha-Bazin","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Christine Almunia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20055251","rel_title":"Relationship between COVID-19 death toll doubling time and national BCG vaccination policy","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20055251","rel_abs":"In this manuscript, we showed a statistically significant difference of the doubling times of the death toll between the group of countries with national universal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and the group without it for recent years.

Miller et al. reported the relationship between BCG vaccination and mortality for COVID-19 based on deaths per million inhabitants. However, they did not take into account the differences in COVID-19 detection rates among the countries and the epidemic stages of the countries. Therefore we used a doubling time of the death toll as a more stable indicator instead. We also investigated the dependency of the BCG strains. Among the 42 BCG-vaccinated countries, the median doubling time of the eight countries using \"Tokyo 172-1\" strain at least partially (Japan, Iraq, Malaysia, South Korea, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) was 7.2 days, and that of the other 34 vaccinated countries was 5.5 days.

Methods: We searched Cochrane library, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CBM, Wanfang Data and CNKI from their inception to March 31, 2020. In addition, we searched related studies on COVID-19 published before March 31, 2020 through Google Scholar. We evaluated the risk of bias of included studies, and synthesized the results using a qualitative synthesis. Results: Six studies met our inclusion criteria. Five studies on SARS showed an overall risk of death of 7.2% to 20.0%. One study of SARS patients who used macrolides, quinolones or beta lactamases showed that the mean duration of hospital stay was 14.2, 13.8 and 16.2 days, respectively, and their average duration of fever was 14.3, 14.0 and 16.2 days, respectively. One cohort study on MERS indicated that macrolide therapy was not associated with a significant reduction in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-1.51, P = 0.56) and improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.47, -1.64], P = 0.68). According to the findings of 33 studies, the proportion of antibiotics use ranged from 19.4% to 100.0% in children and 13.2% to 100.0% in adults, despite the lack of etiological evidence. The most commonly used antibiotics in adults were quinolones, cephalosporins and macrolides and in children meropenem and linezolid. Conclusions: The benefits of antibiotic agents for adults with SARS or MERS were questionable in the absence of bacterial coinfections. There is no evidence to support the use of antibiotic agents for children with COVID-19 in the absence of bacterial coinfection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianjian Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuyi Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Muna Baskota","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yinmei Yang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xingmei Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingyuan Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Christine Almunia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064923","rel_title":"Effects of temperature and humidity on the spread of COVID-19: A systematic review.","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064923","rel_abs":"Background: Faced with the global pandemic of COVID-19, declared by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th 2020, and the need to better understand the seasonal behavior of the virus, our team conducted this systematic review to describe current knowledge about the emergence and replicability of the virus and its correlation with different weather factors such as temperature and relative humidity. Methods: The review was registered with the PROSPERO database. The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, OpenGrey and Google Scholar were examined with the searches restricted to the years 2019 and 2020. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist tool. The GRADE tool was used to assess the quality of the evidence. Results: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, seventeen studies met the review's eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, four studies had a high risk of bias and thirteen studies were scored as moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was graded as low for both outcomes evaluated. Conclusion: Considering the existing scientific evidence, warm and wet climates seem to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence generated was graded as low. However, these variables alone could not explain most of the variability in disease transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paulo Mecenas","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Renata Bastos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Antonio Vallinoto","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"David Normando","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Muna Baskota","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yinmei Yang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xingmei Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingyuan Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Christine Almunia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064956","rel_title":"Multinational modeling of SARS-CoV-2 spreading dynamics: Insights on the heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission and its potential healthcare burden","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064956","rel_abs":"Background: Modelling and projections of COVID-19 using a single set of transmission parameters can be an elaborated because the application of different levels of containment measures at different stages of the worldwide COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We developed a piecewise fitting SEIR methodology to fit the progress of the COVID-19 that can be applied on any of the 185 countries listed in John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The contagious contact rate, the rate of removal and the initially exposed population were obtained at three different stages of the pandemic for a set of 18 countries, and globally for the total number of cases worldwide. The active number of infections and the removed populations were fitted simultaneously to validate the SEIR model against the available time series reports on the number of confirmed infections, recoveries and deaths. We evaluate the effect of a reduction of contagious contact rate on the level of burden put on local healthcare infrastructure considering different levels of intervention. As a guideline for future public health interventions, we also estimated the maximum number of future cases and its potential peak date. Findings: We project that the peak in the number of infections worldwide will take place after the third quarter of 2020 with a decline rate that might extend beyond 2020. For 12 out of the 18 countries analyzed, we observe that, following the trend at the date of this study, the number of severe infections will surpass their healthcare capacity. For a 90% reduction scenario of the contagious contact rate, four out of the 18 countries analyzed will undergo a significant delay in the peak of infection, extending the course of the epidemic further than our simulation window (365 days). Interpretation: We identify three stages for the COVID-19 transmission dynamics, which suggest that it is highly heterogeneous between countries and its contagious contact rate, is currently affected by both local responses of the public health interventions and to the population's adherence to the measures.

When a system is continuously changing over time (e.g., infectious diseases)differential equations, which may include parameters, are used for modeling the system. The process of finding those parameters that best fit the given data from the system is called an inverse problem. This study aims at analyzing the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) spread in South Korea using the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. We collect the data from Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC). We assume that each parameter in the SIR model is a function of time so that we can compute important parameters, such as the basic reproduction number (R0), more delicately. Using neural networks, we propose a method to find the best time-varying parameters and the solution for the model simultaneously. Moreover, using time-dependent parameters, we find that traditional numerical algorithms, such as the Runge-Kutta methods, can successfully approximate the SIR model while fitting the COVID-19 data, thus modeling the propagation patterns of COVID-19 more precisely.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyeontae Jo","author_inst":"POSTECH"},{"author_name":"Hwijae Son","author_inst":"POSTECH"},{"author_name":"Se Young Jung","author_inst":"Seoul National University Bundang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hyung Ju Hwang","author_inst":"POSTECH"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Muna Baskota","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yinmei Yang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xingmei Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingyuan Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Christine Almunia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
