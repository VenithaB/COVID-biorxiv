Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in health care workplace is recommended as a high priority. In order to investigate the relationship between PPE use and the number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, we conducted a molecular epidemiological study among 142 HCWs who were dispatched from Hefei to work in Wuhan and 284 HCWs who remained in Hefei, China; both provided care for patients with COVID-19. Nucleic acid testing and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody (IgM, IgG, IgA) detection were performed to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection among those HCWs. We also extracted publicly released data on daily number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, daily number of HCWs who were dispatched to Hubei province since January 24, and daily production of PPE in China and daily demand and supply of PPE in Hubei province. Our laboratory testing confirmed that none of the 142 HCWs who were dispatched to work in Wuhan and 284 HCWs who remained in Hefei were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with these findings, as of April 15, 2020, none of the 42,600 HCWs who were successively dispatched to Hubei province since January 24, 2020 was reported to have COVID-19. These HCWs were provided with adequate supply of PPE as committed by their original institutions or provinces. In contrast, during the early phase of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, a substantial shortage of PPE and an increasing number of COVID-19 infection among HCWs were reported. With the continuing increase in domestic production of PPE in China, the PPE supply started to meet and then exceed the demand. This coincided with a subsequent reduction in the number of reported COVID-19 cases among HCWs. In conclusion, our findings indicate that COVID-19 infection among HCWs could be completely prevented. Appropriate and adequate PPE might play a crucial role in protecting HCWs against COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China; Clinical Research Hospital (Hefei)"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Zeng Min","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230026, China"},{"author_name":"Chun-Mei Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Hai-Ou Hong","author_inst":"Anhui Provincial Hospital Health Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC; Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Tian Xue","author_inst":"Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC; Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 2300"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC, Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and M"},{"author_name":"Tengchuan Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Zhao-Hui Lu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Liang-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Xueying Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC,  Clinical Research Hospital (Hefei) of Chinese Academy of Science, Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC,"},{"author_name":"Sihui Luo","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC,  Clinical Research Hospital (Hefei) of Chinese Academy of Science, Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC,"},{"author_name":"Wei Bao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Iowa, City"},{"author_name":"Jian-Ping Weng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC,  Clinical Research Hospital (Hefei) of Chinese Academy of Science, Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20074708","rel_title":"Infection Density and Epidemic Size of COVID-19 in China outside the Hubei province","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20074708","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to almost all countries in the world, claiming more than 160,000 lives and sickening more than 2,400,000 people by April 21, 2020. There has been research showing that on average, each infected person spreads the infection to more than two persons. Therefore the majority of the population is at risk of infection if no intervention measures were undertaken. The true size of the COVID-19 epidemic remains unknown, as a significant proportion of infected individuals only exhibit mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. A timely assessment of the evolving epidemic size is crucial for resource allocation and triage decisions. In this article, we modify the back-calculation algorithm to obtain a lower bound estimate of the number of COVID-19 infected persons in China outside the Hubei province. We estimate the infection density among infected and show that the drastic control measures enforced throughout China following the lockdown of Wuhan City effectively slowed down the spread of the disease in two weeks. Our findings from China are expected to provide guidelines and enlightenment for surveillance and control activities of COVID-19 in other countries around the world.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yukun Liu","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Jing Qin","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Yan Fan","author_inst":"Shanghai University of International Business"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Dean A.

Live voting at polls was allowed despite concern over increasing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to 1.1 million absentee ballots cast, 453,222 persons voted live. The purpose of our study was to determine if an increase in COVID-19 activity was associated with the election. Methods: Using the voting age population for the United States (US), WI, and its 3 largest counties, and daily new COVID-19 case reports from various COVID-19 web-based dashboards, daily new case rates were calculated. With election day April 7, the incubation period included April 12-21. The new case activity in the rest of the US was compared with the Wisconsin activity during the incubation period. Results: WI daily new case rates were lower than those of the rest of the US for the 10-day period before the election and remained lower during the post exposure incubation period. The ratio of Wisconsin new case rates to US new case rates was 0.34 WI: 1 US for the 10 days leading up to the election and declined to 0.28 WI: 1 US for the 10-day post-incubation period after the election. Similar analysis for Milwaukee county showed a pre-election ratio of 1.02 Milwaukee: 1 US and after the election the ratio was 0.63 Milwaukee: 1 US. Dane county had a pre-election ratio of 0.21 Dane: 1 US case, and it fell to 0.13 Dane: 1 US after the election. Waukesha county had a pre-election ratio of 0.27 Waukesha: 1 US case and that fell to 0.19 Waukesha: 1 US after the election. Conclusions: There was no increase in COVID-19 new case daily rates observed for Wisconsin or its 3 largest counties following the election on April 7, 2020, as compared to the US, during the post-incubation interval period.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew C Berry","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology, Larkin Community Hospital, South Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Madhuri S Mulekar","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA"},{"author_name":"Bruce B Berry","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Froedtert & The Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Dean A.

We explored the role of lung ultrasonography (LU) in quickly assessing lung status in these patients. Methods: eChoVid is a multicentric study based on routinely collected data, conducted in 3 emergency units of Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris (APHP); 107 patients were included between March 19, 2020 and April 01, 2020 and underwent LU, a short clinical assessment by 2 emergency physicians blinded to each other's and a CT. LU consisted of scoring lesions in 8 chest zones from 0 to 3, defining a severity global score (GS) ranging from 0 to 24. CT severity score ranged from 0 to 3 according to the extent of interstitial pneumonia signs. 48 patients underwent LU by both an expert and a newly trained physician. Findings: The GS showed good performance to predict CT severity assessment of COVID-19 as normal versus pathologic: AUC=0.93, maximal Youden index 1 with 95% sensitivity, and 83% specificity. Similar performance was found for CT assessment as normal or minimal versus moderate or severe (n=90): AUC 0.89, maximal Youden index 7 with 86% sensitivity, and 78% specificity. Good agreement was found for zone scoring assessed by new trainee (30mn theory + 30mn practice) and expert (n=14,14*8 checkpoints), weighted kappa 0.85-1; moderate agreement was found for new trainee (n=48, 30mn theory) and expert, kappa 0.62-0.81. Interpretation: GS score is a simple tool to assess lung damage severity in patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19. Comparing the performance of new trainees and expert physicians opens a path for adoption beyond the scope of experts. LU is a good candidate for patients triage, especially in case of CT availability issues.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mehdi Benchoufi","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France - METHODS Team, Center for Research in Epide"},{"author_name":"Jerome Bokobza","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anthony Anthony Chauvin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, University Diderot, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dion","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris,Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Marie-Laure Baranne","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Fabien Levan","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Cochin, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Maxime Gautier","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cantin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hotel Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Thomas d Humieres","author_inst":"Physiology department, Henri Mondor University Hospital, APHP, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Cedric Gil-Jardine","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department SAMU-SMUR, Pellegrin Hospital, University Hospital Center, Bordeaux, France - Bordeaux Population Health,  INSERM U1219, IETO Team, B"},{"author_name":"Sylvain Benenati","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hospital Group South Ile-de-France, Melun, France"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Oberlin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, New Civil Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mikael Martinez","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Forez Hospital Center, Montbrison, France - Nord Emergency Network Ligerien Ardeche (REULIAN), Hospital Center Le Corbusier, Firminy"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Kahn","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, France"},{"author_name":"Abdourahmane Diallo","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Eric Vicaut","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre Bourrier","author_inst":"Imaging Department Saint-Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20075333","rel_title":"Regional differences in reported Covid-19 cases show genetic correlations with higher socio-economic status and better health, potentially confounding studies on the genetics of disease susceptibility","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20075333","rel_abs":"Background: In March 2020, England showed a rapid increase in Covid-19 cases. Susceptibility for infectious diseases like Covid-19 is likely to be partly genetic. Mapping the genetic susceptibility for Covid-19 outcomes may reveal biological mechanisms that could potentially aid in drug or vaccine developments. However, as the disease spreads unevenly across the country, regional allele frequency differences could become spuriously associated with disease prevalence. Methods: A regional genome-wide association study (RGWAS) was conducted in 396,042 individuals from England to investigate the association between 1.2 million genetic variants and regional differences in daily reported Covid-19 cases from March 1st to April 18th 2020. Results: The polygenic signal increases during the first weeks of March, peaking at March 13th with the measured genetic variants explaining ~3% of the variance, including two genome-wide significant loci. The explained variance starts to drop at the end of March and reaches almost zero on April 18th. The majority of this temporary polygenic signal is due to genes associated with higher educational attainment and better health. Conclusions: The temporary positive relationship between Covid-19 cases and regional socio-economic status (SES) at the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak may reflect 1) a higher degree of international travelers, 2) more social contacts, and\/or 3) better testing capacities in higher SES regions. These signals are in the opposite direction of expected disease risk increasing effects, which has the potential to cancel out signals of interest. Genetic association studies should be aware of the timing and location of cases as this can introduce interfering polygenic signals that reflect regional differences in genes associated with behavior.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdel Abdellaoui","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jerome Bokobza","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anthony Anthony Chauvin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, University Diderot, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dion","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris,Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Marie-Laure Baranne","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Fabien Levan","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Cochin, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Maxime Gautier","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cantin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hotel Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Thomas d Humieres","author_inst":"Physiology department, Henri Mondor University Hospital, APHP, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Cedric Gil-Jardine","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department SAMU-SMUR, Pellegrin Hospital, University Hospital Center, Bordeaux, France - Bordeaux Population Health,  INSERM U1219, IETO Team, B"},{"author_name":"Sylvain Benenati","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hospital Group South Ile-de-France, Melun, France"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Oberlin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, New Civil Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mikael Martinez","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Forez Hospital Center, Montbrison, France - Nord Emergency Network Ligerien Ardeche (REULIAN), Hospital Center Le Corbusier, Firminy"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Kahn","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, France"},{"author_name":"Abdourahmane Diallo","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Eric Vicaut","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre Bourrier","author_inst":"Imaging Department Saint-Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20075648","rel_title":"Displacement ventilation: available ventilation strategy for makeshift hospitals and public buildings to contain Covid-19and other airborne diseases","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20075648","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has so far infected more than2.4 million people around the world, and its impact is being felt by all. Patients with airborne diseases such as Covid-19 should ideally be treated in negative pressure isolation rooms. However, due to the overwhelming demand for hospital beds, patients treated in general wards, hospital corridors, and makeshift hospitals. Adequate building ventilationin hospitals and public spaces is a crucial factor to contain the disease [1,2], to exit the current lockdown situation, and reduce the chance of subsequent waves of outbreaks. Lu et al. [3] reported an air-conditioner induced Covid-19 outbreak, by an asymptomatic patient, in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, which exposes our vulnerability to future outbreaks linked to ventilation in public spaces. We demonstrate that displacement ventilation(either mechanical or naturalventilation), where air intakes are at low level and extracts are at high level, is a viable alternative to negative pressure isolation rooms, which are often not available on site in hospital wards and makeshift hospitals. Displacement ventilation produces negative pressure at the occupant level, which draws fresh air from outdoor, and positive pressure near the ceiling, which expels the hot and contaminated air out. We acknowledge that, in both developed and developing countries, many modern large structures lack the openings required for natural ventilation. This lack of openings can be supplemented by installing extract fans.

We recommend that any assay being evaluated for diagnostic tests be compared with prevalent sequence data from the region of proposed testing and that continued publicly accessible sequence information continue to be provided by the research community.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Derek Toms","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Julang Li","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Hugh Y Cai","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dion","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris,Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Marie-Laure Baranne","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Fabien Levan","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Cochin, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Maxime Gautier","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cantin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hotel Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Thomas d Humieres","author_inst":"Physiology department, Henri Mondor University Hospital, APHP, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Cedric Gil-Jardine","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department SAMU-SMUR, Pellegrin Hospital, University Hospital Center, Bordeaux, France - Bordeaux Population Health,  INSERM U1219, IETO Team, B"},{"author_name":"Sylvain Benenati","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hospital Group South Ile-de-France, Melun, France"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Oberlin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, New Civil Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mikael Martinez","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Forez Hospital Center, Montbrison, France - Nord Emergency Network Ligerien Ardeche (REULIAN), Hospital Center Le Corbusier, Firminy"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Kahn","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, France"},{"author_name":"Abdourahmane Diallo","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Eric Vicaut","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre Bourrier","author_inst":"Imaging Department Saint-Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20075291","rel_title":"Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate by real-time antibody screening of blood donors","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20075291","rel_abs":"Background: The pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has tremendous consequences for our societies. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and also to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. Blood donors comprise approximately 4.7% of the similarly aged population of Denmark and blood is donated in all areas of the country. The objective of this study was to perform real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR. Methods: All Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to 17 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The first 9,496 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.7% (CI: 0.9-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100,000 (CI: 59-154) infections. Conclusions: The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR, including only individuals with no comorbidity, is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. This may have implications for risk mitigation. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Erikstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Christoffer Egeberg Hother","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Ole Birger Vestager Pedersen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Zealand University Hospital, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"K\u00e5re M\u00f8lbak","author_inst":"Infection Control, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Robert Leo Skov","author_inst":"Infection Control, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Dorte Kinggaard Holm","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susanne S\u00e6kmose","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Zealand University Hospital, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anna Christine Nilsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076562","rel_title":"COVID-19 spreading: a model","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076562","rel_abs":"This communication describes a recursive mathematical model of the spreading COVID-19 infection, which allows estimating the effectiveness of quarantine measures.

Methods: We first propose the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model which is based on the original single-chain model to describe the revival of COVID-19 in some countries. Multi-chains are considered as the superposition of distinctive single chains. Parameter identification is carried out by minimizing the penalty function. Results: From results of numerical simulations, the multi-chain model performs well on data fitting and reasonably interprets the revival phenomena. The band of 25% fluctuation of simulation results could contain most seemly unsteady increments. Conclusion: The multi-chain model has better performance on data fitting in revival situations compared with the single-chain model. It is predicted by the three-chain model with data by Apr 21 that the epidemic curve of Iran would level off on round May 10, and the final cumulative confirmed cases would be around 88820. The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval would be around 96000.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanshuang Pan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Nian Shao","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yue Yan","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Luo","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20076620","rel_title":"Predictors of adherence to public health instructions during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20076620","rel_abs":"Importance: Identifying risk factors for adherence to public health instructions for the COVID-19 pandemic may be crucial for controlling the rate of transmission and the pandemic's health and economic impacts.

Design: Cross-sectional survey in Israel collected between March 28 and April 10, 2020. Setting: Population-based study. Participants: A convenience sample completed an online survey. Exposures: Sociodemographic, health-related, risk-related, and instruction-related characteristics of the participants that have been linked to adherence to medical instructions. Main Outcome and Measure: Non-adherence to instructions defined by a mean score of less than 4 on a 1 to 5 adherence scale consisting of 19 instruction items. Results: Among 654 participants (413 [64.8%] female, age 40.14 [15.23] years), 28.7% were defined as non-adherents. Non-adherence was associated with male gender [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.54, CI 1.03-2.31], not having children [aOR = 1.73, 1.13-2.65], smoking [aOR = 2.27, CI 1.42-3.62], high levels of ADHD symptoms [aOR = 1.55, CI 1.07-2.25], high levels of past risk-taking behavior [aOR = 1.41, CI 1.10-1.81], as well as by current high psychological distress [aOR = 1.51, CI 1.14-2.01], low perceived risk of COVID-19 [aOR = 1.52, CI 1.22-1.89], low exposure to the instructions [aOR = 1.45, CI 1.14-1.82], and low perceived efficacy of the instructions [aOR = 1.47, CI 1.16-1.85]. Adjusted OR of age, economic status, physical health status, and exposure to media did not reach the significance level.

Our comparison is based on a computerized simulation integrating accumulated SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological knowledge. Our results stress the importance of immediate on-symptom isolation of suspected cases and household members, and the beneficial effects of prompt testing capacity. Our findings expose significant epidemic-suppression differences among strategies with seemingly similar economic cost stressing the importance of not just the portion of population and business that is released, but also the pattern. The most effective building blocks are the ones that integrate several base strategies - they allow to release large portions of the population while still achieving diminishing viral spread. However, it may come with a price on somewhat more complex schemes. For example, our simulations indicate that a personal isolation of 4 days once every two weeks, for example a long weekend (Fri-Mon) self-isolation once every two weeks, while protecting the 5% most sensitive population would reduce R well below 1 even if ten percent of the population do not follow it. This kind of integrated strategy can be either voluntary or mandatory and enforced. We further simulate the contrasting approach of a stratified population release in a hope to achieve herd immunity, which for the time being seems inferior to other suggested building blocks. Knowing the tradeoff between building blocks could help optimize exit strategies to be more effective and suitable for a particular area or country, while maximizing human life as well as economic value. Given our results, we believe that pandemic can be controlled within a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable socio-economic burden.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elad Barkan","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yeela Talmor-Barkan","author_inst":"Rabin Medical Center (Beilinson and Hasharon Hospitals)"},{"author_name":"Itai Berger","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076877","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Detection Using an Isothermal Amplification Reaction and a Rapid, Inexpensive Protocol for Sample Inactivation and Purification","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076877","rel_abs":"As the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic spreads, the need for more diagnostic capabilities is great.

In addition to this, we have developed an inexpensive pipeline to further increase sensitivity without requiring highly specialized equipment. A rapid inactivation protocol capable of inactivating virions, as well as endogenous nucleases, was also developed to increase sensitivity and sample stability. This protocol, combined with our RT-LAMP assay, has a sensitivity of at least 50 viral RNA copies per microliter in a sample. To further increase the sensitivity, a purification protocol compatible with this inactivation method was developed. The inactivation and purification protocol, combined with our RT-LAMP assay, brings the sensitivity to at least 1 viral RNA copy per microliter in a sample.

Available evidence is limited to a few retrospective observational studies with small number of patients. We did a meta-analysis to assess the effect of ACEi\/ARB in patients with COVID-19 on severity of disease, risk for hospitalisation, and death compared to those not on ACEi\/ARB. We searched the Cochrane library, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and medRxiv for studies published until 25.04.2020. Inclusion criteria included all studies with patients with confirmed COVID-19 either taking, or not taking, ACEi\/ARB. Depending on degree of heterogeneity, fixed or random effect model was selected to calculate effect size (Odds ratio). Results: Six studies were eligible for this meta-analysis. These included 423 patients on ACEi\/ARB, and 1419 not on ACEi\/ARB. Compared to patients with COVID-19 not on ACEi\/ARB, there was a statistically significant 43% reduction (OR 0.57, CI: 0.37-0.88, I2: 0.000) in the odds of death in those on ACEi\/ARB. There was a statistically non-significant 38% reduction (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.31-1.23, I2=70.36) in the odds of developing severe disease and 19% reduction (OR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.42-1.55, I2: 0.000) in the odds of hospitalisation among those on ACEi\/ARB. Discussion: It is safe to use ACEi\/ARB in patients with COVID-19 requiring these medications for associated comorbidities. Although limited by confounding factors typical of a meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies, our data suggests that use of these medications may reduce the odds of death. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis of the updated studies on SARS-CoV-2 reassures the medical fraternity on the use of and continuation of ACEi\/ARB, supporting all recent recommendations .","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SAMIT GHOSAL","author_inst":"Nightingale Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jagat Jyoti Mukherjee","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Binayak Sinha","author_inst":"AMRI Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Kalyan Kumar Gangopadhyay","author_inst":"Fortis & Peerless Hospital, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076471","rel_title":"Pharmacokinetic bases of the hydroxychloroquine response in COVID-19: implications for therapy and prevention","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076471","rel_abs":"Chloroquine\/hydroxychloroquine has recently been the subject of intense debate in regard to its potential antiviral activity against SARS-Cov-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Some report possible curative effects, others do not. In order to shed some light on this rather controversial topic, we used mathematical modelling to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. Our computer-aided simulations show that hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak but that viral clearance is not significantly accelerated if the drug is not administered early enough (i.e. when viral loads range from 1 to 1,000 copies\/mL). Although some authors had used the trough plasma concentrations or the theoretical drug distribution in the lung to model the effect of chloroquine\/hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19, the theoretical drug response based on the trough whole blood concentrations of the drug agreed well with the results of the clinical trials so far reported. Moreover, the effects of chloroquine\/hydroxychloroquine could be fully explained when taking into account also the capacity of this drug to raise cell-mediated responses against the productively SARS-Cov-2-infected cells. On the whole, the present study suggests that chloroquine\/hydroxychloroquine has a narrow therapeutic window, which overlaps with the highest tolerated doses. These considerations may have implications for development of anti-COVID-19 combination therapies and prevention strategies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Savarino","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Italian Institute of Health, Rome, Italy."},{"author_name":"Mohammad Tarek","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Department, Armed Forces College of Medicine (AFCM), Cairo, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Binayak Sinha","author_inst":"AMRI Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Kalyan Kumar Gangopadhyay","author_inst":"Fortis & Peerless Hospital, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076042","rel_title":"Features of 16,749 hospitalised UK patients with COVID-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076042","rel_abs":"Objective: To characterize the clinical features of patients with severe COVID-19 in the UK. Design: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real-time analysis, using a pre-approved questionnaire adopted by the WHO. Setting: 166 UK hospitals between 6th February and 18th April 2020. Participants: 16,749 people with COVID-19. Interventions: No interventions were performed, but with consent samples were taken for research purposes. Many participants were co-enrolled in other interventional studies and clinical trials. Results: The median age was 72 years [IQR 57, 82; range 0, 104], the median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days [IQR 1,8] and the median duration of hospital stay was 7 days [IQR 4,12]. The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (29%), uncomplicated diabetes (19%), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (19%) and asthma (14%); 47% had no documented reported comorbidity. Increased age and comorbidities including obesity were associated with a higher probability of mortality. Distinct clusters of symptoms were found: 1. respiratory (cough, sputum, sore throat, runny nose, ear pain, wheeze, and chest pain); 2. systemic (myalgia, joint pain and fatigue); 3. enteric (abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea). Overall, 49% of patients were discharged alive, 33% have died and 17% continued to receive care at date of reporting. 17% required admission to High Dependency or Intensive Care Units; of these, 31% were discharged alive, 45% died and 24% continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 20% were discharged alive, 53% died and 27% remained in hospital.

The COVID-19 disease course is strikingly divergent. Approximately 80-85% of patients experience mild or no symptoms, while the remainder develop severe disease. The mechanisms underlying these divergent outcomes are unclear. Emerging health disparities data regarding African American and homeless populations suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) may be an underlying driver of COVID-19 severity. To better define the VDI-COVID-19 link, we determined the prevalence of VDI among our COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: In an Institutional Review Board approved study performed at a single, tertiary care academic medical center, the medical records of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were included for whom serum 25-hydroxycholecalcifoerol (25OHD) levels were determined. COVID-19-relevant data were compiled and analyzed. We determined the frequency of VDI among COVID-19 patients to evaluate the likelihood of a VDI-COVID-19 relationship. Results: Twenty COVID-19 patients with serum 25OHD levels were identified; 65.0% required ICU admission.The VDI prevalence in ICU patients was 84.6%, vs. 57.1% in floor patients. Strikingly, 100% of ICU patients less than 75 years old had VDI. Coagulopathy was present in 62.5% of ICU COVID-19 patients, and 92.3% were lymphocytopenic. Conclusions: VDI is highly prevalent in severe COVID-19 patients. VDI and severe COVID-19 share numerous associations including hypertension, obesity, male sex, advanced age, concentration in northern climates, coagulopathy, and immune dysfunction. Thus, we suggest that prospective, randomized controlled studies of VDI in COVID-19 patients are warranted.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frank H.

It is essential to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and uncover potential risk factors for severe disease to reduce the overall mortality rate of COVID-19. Methods Sixty-one critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 93 severe non-ICU patients at Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) were included in this study. Medical records, including demographic, platelet counts, heparin-involved treatments, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-(HIT) related laboratory tests, and fatal outcomes of COVID-19 patients were analyzed and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Findings Sixty-one critical COVID-19 patients treated in ICU included 15 survivors and 46 nonsurvivors. Forty-one percent of them (25\/61) had severe thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count (PLT) less than 50x109\/L, of whom 76% (19\/25) had a platelet decrease of >50% compared to baseline; 96% of these patients (24\/25) had a fatal outcome. Among the 46 nonsurvivors, 52.2% (24\/46) had severe thrombocytopenia, compared to 6.7% (1\/15) among survivors. Moreover, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) could induce a significant decrease in PLT in 81.3% of critical CRRT patients (13\/16), resulting in a fatal outcome. In addition, a high level of anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies, a marker of HIT, was observed in most ICU patients. Surprisingly, HIT occurred not only in patients with heparin exposure, such as CRRT, but also in heparin-naive patients, suggesting that spontaneous HIT may occur in COVID-19. Interpretation Anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies are induced in critical COVID-19 patients, resulting in a progressive platelet decrease. Exposure to a high dose of heparin may trigger further severe thrombocytopenia with a fatal outcome. An alternative anticoagulant other than heparin should be used to treat COVID-19 patients in critical condition.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiaopeng Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yongjiu Xiao","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital of the People Liberation Army"},{"author_name":"Ting Gao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Guangfei Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhongyi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhang Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yong Hu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qincai Dong","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Songtao Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Li Yu","author_inst":"the 969th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army Joint Logistics Support Force"},{"author_name":"Shuwei Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Hongzhen Li","author_inst":"Joinn Laboratories (China) Co.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed several criteria that define high-risk individuals, but multivariable prediction models may allow for a more accurate and granular risk evaluation. In the early days of the pandemic, when individual level data required for training prediction models was not available, a large healthcare organization developed a prediction model for supporting its COVID-19 policy using a hybrid strategy. The model was constructed on a baseline predictor to rank patients according to their risk for severe respiratory infection or sepsis (trained using over one-million patient records) and was then post-processed to calibrate the predictions to reported COVID-19 case fatality rates. Since its deployment in mid-March, this predictor was integrated into many decision-processes in the organization that involved allocating limited resources. With the accumulation of enough COVID-19 patients, the predictor was validated for its accuracy in predicting COVID-19 mortality among all COVID-19 cases in the organization (3,176, 3.1% death rate). The predictor was found to have good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.942. Calibration was also good, with a marked improvement compared to the calibration of the baseline model when evaluated for the COVID-19 mortality outcome. While the CDC criteria identify 41% of the population as high-risk with a resulting sensitivity of 97%, a 5% absolute risk cutoff by the model tags only 14% to be at high-risk while still achieving a sensitivity of 90%. To summarize, we found that even in the midst of a pandemic, shrouded in epidemiologic \"fog of war\" and with no individual level data, it was possible to provide a useful predictor with good discrimination and calibration.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noam Barda","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dan Riesel","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Amichay Akriv","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Joseph Levi","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Uriah Finkel","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gal Yona","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"Daniel Greenfeld","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shimon Sheiba","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Somer","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eitan Bachmat","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Guy N Rothblum","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"Uri Shalit","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Doron Netzer","author_inst":"Community Medical Services Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Noa Dagan","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jonathan S Nguyen-Van-Tam","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham School of Medicine, Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"National Infection Service, Public Health England and Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter JM Openshaw","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Division, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and Institute of Translational Medicine, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Universi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076919","rel_title":"A simple mathematical model for Coronavirus (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076919","rel_abs":"A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019, it causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia.

For most people, COVID-19 infection will cause mild illness (fever and at least one symptom of respiratory disease); however, for more than 3.4% of people, it can be fatal. Older people and those with preexisting medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, or diabetes) are at risk of severe disease and mortality. The incubation period of the virus is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days, but longer incubation had been reported. Furthermore, data published by world authorities show that statistics are different for different geographical regions and depend on many social and environmental factors. The sad reality of the COVID-19 is that there are currently no medications or vaccines proven to be effective for the treatment or prevention of the disease. The pandemic spread is consequenctly followed by a worldwide panic. Facing this dramatic uncertain situation, implementing a country-wide strategy for social distancing and a general logistic policy for critical and life-saving supplies is an urgent for government and sanitary authorities. Several mathematical models have been proposed to predict epidemic spread. However, models should be adapted to specific situations in countries where geographic, societal, economic, and political strategies are different. Here, we propose the application of the well-known SIR model to the case study of Tunisia for which data are collected from three databases in order to have rapidly predict the situation. Such results can be useful in the future to design a more reliable model to help in monitoring infection control.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abir Lassoued","author_inst":"University of Carthage, National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Afef Ben Saad","author_inst":"University of Carthage, National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hela Lassoued","author_inst":"University of Carthage, National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Raouf Ketata","author_inst":"University of Carthage, National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Olfa Boubaker","author_inst":"University of Carthage; National Institue of Applied Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gal Yona","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"Daniel Greenfeld","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shimon Sheiba","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Somer","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eitan Bachmat","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Guy N Rothblum","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"Uri Shalit","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Doron Netzer","author_inst":"Community Medical Services Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Noa Dagan","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jonathan S Nguyen-Van-Tam","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham School of Medicine, Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"National Infection Service, Public Health England and Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter JM Openshaw","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Division, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and Institute of Translational Medicine, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Universi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076885","rel_title":"Facing the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC: a stochastic agent-based model of various intervention strategies","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076885","rel_abs":"Global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented infectious disease crisis worldwide. Despite uncertainties about COVID-19, model-based forecasting of competing mitigation measures on its course is urgently needed to inform mitigation policy. We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City and evaluated the potential impact of quarantine duration (from 4 to 16 weeks), quarantine lifting type (1-step lifting for all individuals versus a 2-step lifting according to age), post-quarantine screening, and use of a hypothetical effective treatment against COVID-19 on the disease's cumulative incidence and mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The source code of the model has been deposited in a public source code repository. The model calibrated well and variation of model parameter values had little impact on outcome estimates. While quarantine is efficient to contain the viral spread, it is unlikely to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted. We projected that lifting quarantine in a single step for the full population would be unlikely to substantially lower the cumulative mortality, regardless of quarantine duration. By contrast, a two-step quarantine lifting according to age was associated with a substantially lower cumulative mortality and incidence, up to 71% and 23%, respectively, as well as lower ICU-bed occupancy. Although post-quarantine screening was associated with diminished epidemic rebound, this strategy may not prevent ICUs from being overcrowded. It may even become deleterious after a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age if the herd immunity effect does not had sufficient time to become established in the younger population when the quarantine is lifted for the older population. An effective treatment against COVID-19 would considerably reduce the consequences of the epidemic, even more so if ICU capacity is not exceeded.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Hoertel","author_inst":"Paris University"},{"author_name":"Martin Blachier","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Carlos Blanco","author_inst":"National Institute on Drug Abuse"},{"author_name":"Mark Olfson","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Marc Massetti","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Frederic Limosin","author_inst":"Paris University"},{"author_name":"Henri Leleu","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Shimon Sheiba","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Somer","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eitan Bachmat","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Guy N Rothblum","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"Uri Shalit","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Doron Netzer","author_inst":"Community Medical Services Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Noa Dagan","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jonathan S Nguyen-Van-Tam","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham School of Medicine, Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"National Infection Service, Public Health England and Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter JM Openshaw","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Division, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and Institute of Translational Medicine, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Universi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076935","rel_title":"Association of Digestive Symptoms and Hospitalization in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076935","rel_abs":"Background: High rates of concurrent gastrointestinal manifestations have been noted in patients with COVID- 19, however the association between these digestive manifestations and need for hospitalization has not been established. Methods: Following expedited approval from our Institutional Review Board, we analyzed retrospectively collected data from consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 based on a positive polymerase chain reaction testing at our institution from March 03, 2020 to April 7, 2020. Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory and patient-reported symptom data were collected at presentation in the emergency room. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between hospitalization and presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: During this study period, we identified 207 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19. 34.5% noted concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms; of which 90% of gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. In a multivariate regression model controlled for demographics and disease severity, an increased risk for hospitalization was noted in patients with any gastrointestinal symptom (adjusted OR 4.84 95% CI: 1.68-13.94]. Diarrhea was associated with a seven-fold higher likelihood for hospitalization (adjusted OR=7.58, 95% CI: 2.49-20.02, P <0.001) and nausea or vomiting had a four times higher odds (adjusted OR 4.39, 95% CI: 1.61-11.4, P = 0.005). Conclusion: We demonstrate that a significant portion of COVID19 patients have concurrent mild gastrointestinal symptoms and that the presence of these digestive symptoms is associated with a need for hospitalization. With the current focus on streamlining triaging efforts, first responders and frontline providers should consider assessing for digestive symptoms in their initial clinical evaluation and decision-making.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George Cholankeril","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander Podboy","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Vickie Aivaliotas","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Edward A Pham","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Branden Tarlow","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sean Spencer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Donghee Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ann Hsing","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Aijaz Ahmed","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Eitan Bachmat","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Guy N Rothblum","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"Uri Shalit","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Doron Netzer","author_inst":"Community Medical Services Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Noa Dagan","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jonathan S Nguyen-Van-Tam","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham School of Medicine, Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"National Infection Service, Public Health England and Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter JM Openshaw","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Division, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and Institute of Translational Medicine, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Universi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076943","rel_title":"Variation in COVID-19 Outbreaks at U.S. State and County Levels","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076943","rel_abs":"Background.

A statistical model is estimated using publicly available outbreak data in the U.S., and regional differences are statistically analyzed. Results. There is significant variance in outbreak data between U.S. states and counties. At the state level, the outbreak rate follows a normal distribution with an average relative growth rate of 0.197 (doubling time 3.518 days). But there is a low degree of reliability between state-wide and county-specific data reported (ICC = 0.169, p < 0.001), with a bias of 0.070 (standard deviation 0.062) as shown with a Bland-Altman plot. Conclusions. The results emphasize the need for policy makers to look at the pandemic from the smallest population subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented, and critical resources provided effectively.

Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses if added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here, we show that the addition of heparin to Vero cells between 6.25 - 200 g.ml-1, which spans the concentration of heparin in therapeutic use, and inhibits invasion by SARS-CoV-2 at between 44 and 80%. We also demonstrate that heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain and induces a conformational change, illustrated by surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies. The structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends were investigated using a library of heparin derivatives and size-defined fragments. Binding is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2-O or 6-O sulphation, and the consequent conformational consequences in the heparin structure, than on N-sulphation. A hexasaccharide is required for conformational changes to be induced in the secondary structure that are comparable to those that arise from heparin binding. Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. These findings have implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin as well as for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney Mycroft-West","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Isabel Pagani","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Timothy Rudd","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Stefano Elli","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

Such simulations need to support continuous updating in response to rapid advances in understanding of infection mechanisms, and parallel development of components by multiple groups. We present an open-source platform for multiscale spatiotemporal simulation of an epithelial tissue, viral infection, cellular immune response and tissue damage, specifically designed to be modular and extensible to support continuous updating and parallel development. The base simulation of a simplified patch of epithelial tissue and immune response exhibits distinct patterns of infection dynamics from widespread infection, to recurrence, to clearance. Slower viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment slow infection and promote containment. Because antiviral drugs can have side effects and show reduced clinical effectiveness when given later during infection, we studied the effects on progression of treatment potency and time-of-first treatment after infection. In simulations, even a low potency therapy with a drug which reduces the replication rate of viral RNA greatly decreases the total tissue damage and virus burden when given near the beginning of infection. Many combinations of dosage and treatment time lead to stochastic outcomes, with some simulation replicas showing clearance or control (treatment success), while others show rapid infection of all epithelial cells (treatment failure). Thus, while a high potency therapy usually is less effective when given later, treatments at late times are occasionally effective. We illustrate how to extend the platform to model specific virus types (e.g., hepatitis C) and add additional cellular mechanisms (tissue recovery and variable cell susceptibility to infection), using our software modules and publicly-available software repository.\n\nAuthor summaryThis study presents an open-source, extensible, multiscale platform for simulating viral immune interactions in epithelial tissues, which enables the rapid development and deployment of sophisticated models of viruses, infection mechanisms and tissue types. The model is used to investigate how potential treatments influence disease progression. Simulation results suggest that drugs which interfere with virus replication (e.g., remdesivir) yield substantially better infection outcomes when administered prophylactically even at very low doses than when used at high doses as treatment for an infection that has already begun.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"T.J.

Subcellular localization of its viral RNA could play important roles in viral replication and host antiviral immune response. Here we perform computational modeling of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA localization across eight subcellular neighborhoods. We compare hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the human transcriptome and other coronaviruses and perform systematic sub-sequence analyses to identify the responsible signals. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models, we predict that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and all sgRNAs are enriched in the host mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus. The 5 and 3 viral untranslated regions possess the strongest and most distinct localization signals. We discuss the mitochondrial localization signal in relation to the formation of double-membrane vesicles, a critical stage in the coronavirus life cycle.

This study aimed to evaluate existing literature for factors associated with COVID-19 illness severity. Methods: A systematic review identified all studies published between 1\/12\/19 and 19\/4\/20 that used primary data and inferential statistics to assess associations between the outcome of interest - disease severity - and historical or clinical variables. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the WHO Database of Publications on Coronavirus Disease were searched. Data were independently extracted and cross-checked independently by two reviewers using PRISMA guidelines, after which they were descriptively analysed. Quality and risk of bias in available evidence were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. This review was registered with PROSPERO, registration number CRD42020178098. Results: Of the 6202 relevant articles found, 63 were eligible for inclusion; these studies analysed data from 17648 COVID-19 patients. The majority (n=57, 90.5%) were from China and nearly all (n=51, 90.5%) focussed on admitted adult patients. Patients had a median age of 52.5 years and 52.8% were male. The predictors most frequently associated with COVID-19 disease severity were age, absolute lymphocyte count, hypertension, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and history of any pre-existing medical condition. Conclusion: This study identified multiple variables likely to be predictive of severe COVID-19 illness. Due to the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is currently no severity prediction tool designed to, or validated for, COVID-19 illness severity. Findings may inform such a tool that can offer guidance on clinical treatment and disposition, and ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality due to the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer L Pigoga","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Friedman","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Morgan Broccoli","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hirner","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antoinette Vanessa Naidoo","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Swasthi Singh","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kalin Werner","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Lee A Wallis","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Ellen M.

Development of vaccine is challenging. Aim: To determine the proportion of people who intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in France or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial. Methods: We conducted an anonymous on-line survey from the 26th of March to the 20th of April 2020. Primary endpoints were the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available or participate in a vaccine clinical trial. Results: Three thousand two hundred and fifty nine individuals answered the survey; women accounted for 67.4 % of the responders, 670 (20.6 %) were under 30 years of age, 1,502 (46.1 %) between 30-49 years, 803 (24.6 %) between 50-64 years, 271 (8.3%) between 65-80 years, 13 (0.4%) over 80 years of age. According to their statements, 2.512 participants (77.6%, 95 % CI 76.2-79 %) will certainly or probably agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Older age, male gender, fear about COVID-19, being healthcare workers and individual perceived risk were associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance Vaccine hesitancy was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. One thousand and five hundred and fifty responders (47.6 % 95 % CI 45.9-49.3 %) will certainly or probably agree to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Conclusions and Relevance: Nearly 75 % and 48 % of the survey responders were likely to accept vaccination or participation in a clinical trial against COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy will be the major barrier to COVID-19 vaccine uptake.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maelle Detoc","author_inst":"CHU de Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Bruel","author_inst":"Faculte de Medecine Jacques Lisfranc, Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Paul Frappe","author_inst":"Faculte de medecine Jacques Lisfranc"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Botelho-Nevers","author_inst":"CHU de Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Amandine Gagneux-Brunon","author_inst":"CHU de Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Swasthi Singh","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kalin Werner","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Lee A Wallis","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Ellen M.
