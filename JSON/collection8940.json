Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaolong Tian","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Li","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ailing Huang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shuai Xia","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Sicong Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhengli Shi","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenlin Yang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yanling Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tianlei Ying","author_inst":"Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.28.923169","rel_title":"Beware of asymptomatic transmission: Study on 2019-nCoV prevention and control measures based on extended SEIR model","rel_date":"2020-01-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.28.923169","rel_abs":"BackgroundThe 2019 new coronavirus, \"2019-nCoV\", was discovered from Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases in December 2019, and was named by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020.

Specifically, in the 5-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.\n\nConclusionsThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.

However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear.\n\nObjectivesWe aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS.\n\nMethodsData on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS.\n\nMeasurements and main resultsAs of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic.\n\nConclusionsNCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective.

The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As a novel virus, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP remain unclear, and it is also important to compare it with SARS.\n\nWhat This Study Adds to the FieldWe compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS, and found that NCP has a higher transmissibility than SARS. Time-varying production number indicates that rigorous control measures taken by governments are effective across China, and persistent efforts are needed to be taken for reducing instantaneous reproduction number below one.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiong Hu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianpeng Xiao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guanhao He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min Kang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zuhua Rong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Haojie Zhong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qiong Huang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Aiping Deng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Weilin Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Tan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Siqing Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Zhu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jiansen Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Dexin Gong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Donghua Wan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shaowei Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lingchuan Guo","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Limei Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"systems biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.25.919688","rel_title":"Origin time and epidemic dynamics of the 2019 novel coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-01-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.25.919688","rel_abs":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have emerged from Wuhan, China.

The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to other countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has not yet been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005. This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a large global epidemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robin Nicholas Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mei Wang","author_inst":"PKU"},{"author_name":"Jianpeng Xiao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guanhao He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min Kang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zuhua Rong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Haojie Zhong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qiong Huang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Aiping Deng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Weilin Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Tan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Siqing Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Zhu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jiansen Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Dexin Gong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Donghua Wan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shaowei Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lingchuan Guo","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Limei Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"ecology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.23.916726","rel_title":"Modelling the epidemic trend of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China","rel_date":"2020-01-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.23.916726","rel_abs":"We present a timely evaluation of the Chinese 2019-nCov epidemic in its initial phase, where 2019-nCov demonstrates comparable transmissibility but lower fatality rates than SARS and MERS.

Despite intense research effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12nd 2019. Epidemiological investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 26th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing4 identified a novel RNA virus from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history of genomic recombination. This outbreak highlights the ongoing capacity of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan Wu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Su Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Bin Yu","author_inst":"Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Yan-Mei Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Hu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Zhi-Gang Song","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhao-Wu Tao","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Jun-Hua Tian","author_inst":"Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Yuan Pei","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Li Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Yu-Ling Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Fa-Hui Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Qi-Min Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jiao-Jiao Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Lin Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, School of Life and Environmental Sciences and School of Medical Sciences, The University of Sydn"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Limei Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.23.20018549","rel_title":"Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions","rel_date":"2020-01-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.23.20018549","rel_abs":"Since first identified, the epidemic scale of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, has increased rapidly, with cases arising across China and other countries and regions. using a transmission model, we estimate a basic reproductive number of 3.11 (95%CI, 2.39-4.13);

FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Domenico Benvenuto","author_inst":"Unit of Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Italy."},{"author_name":"Marta Giovanetti","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ciccozzi","author_inst":"Unit of Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Italy."},{"author_name":"Silvia Spoto","author_inst":"Interna Medicine Unit, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Italy."},{"author_name":"Silvia Angeletti","author_inst":"Unit of Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Ciccozzi","author_inst":"Unit of Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Italy."},{"author_name":"Zhi-Gang Song","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhao-Wu Tao","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Jun-Hua Tian","author_inst":"Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Yuan Pei","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Li Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Yu-Ling Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Fa-Hui Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Qi-Min Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jiao-Jiao Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Lin Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, School of Life and Environmental Sciences and School of Medical Sciences, The University of Sydn"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Limei Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.23.916395","rel_title":"Preliminary estimation of the basic reproduction number of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China, from 2019 to 2020: A data-driven analysis in the early phase of the outbreak","rel_date":"2020-01-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.23.916395","rel_abs":"BackgroundsAn ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city of China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces\/regions of China and countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.\n\nMethodsAccounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate ({gamma}), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.\n\nFindingsThe early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0.\n\nConclusionThe mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and significantly larger than 1.

Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4--3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian L Althaus","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jinjun Ran","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Salihu  Sabiu MUSA","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Guangpu Yang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Weiming Wang","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Lou","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Daozhou Gao","author_inst":"Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Yang","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Daihai He","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Maggie H Wang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ling Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Fa-Hui Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Qi-Min Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jiao-Jiao Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Lin Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, School of Life and Environmental Sciences and School of Medical Sciences, The University of Sydn"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Limei Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.21.914044","rel_title":"Host and infectivity prediction of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus using deep learning algorithm","rel_date":"2020-01-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.21.914044","rel_abs":"The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting their risks of infecting people. In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIt is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input. Applied to the Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus, our prediction demonstrated that several vertebrate-infectious coronaviruses have strong potential to infect human. This method will be helpful in future viral analysis and early prevention and control of viral pathogens.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qian Guo","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, and Center for Quantitative Biology, and "},{"author_name":"Mo Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, and Center for Quantitative Biology, and "},{"author_name":"Chunhui Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, and Center for Quantitative Biology, and "},{"author_name":"Zhengcheng Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, and Center for Quantitative Biology, and "},{"author_name":"Peihong Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, and Center for Quantitative Biology, and "},{"author_name":"Jie Tan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, and Center for Quantitative Biology, and "},{"author_name":"Shufang Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, and Center for Quantitative Biology, and "},{"author_name":"Yonghong Xiao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Huaiqiu Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, and Center for Quantitative Biology, Peki"},{"author_name":"Daihai He","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Maggie H Wang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ling Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Fa-Hui Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Qi-Min Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jiao-Jiao Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Lin Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, School of Life and Environmental Sciences and School of Medical Sciences, The University of Sydn"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Limei Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"systems biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.22.914952","rel_title":"Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin","rel_date":"2020-01-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.22.914952","rel_abs":"Since the SARS outbreak 18 years ago, a large number of severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats1-4.

Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans, in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, started from December 12th, 2019, has caused 198 laboratory confirmed infections with three fatal cases by January 20th, 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at the early stage of the outbreak. They are almost identical to each other and share 79.5% sequence identify to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was found that nCoV-2019 is 96% identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. The pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. The nCoV-2019 virus was then isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient, which can be neutralized by sera from several patients.

diseases ranging from hemorrhagic fevers to encephalitis. Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.\n\nImportanceNo antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zachary J Sandler","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Michelle N Vu","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Vineet D.

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael C Letko","author_inst":"NIH\/NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIH\/NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vineet D.

The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tianmu Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jia Rui","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qiupeng Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zeyu Zhao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jing-An Cui","author_inst":"Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture"},{"author_name":"Ling Yin","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hao-Rui Si","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bei Li","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chao-Lin Huang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui-Dong Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yun Luo","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hua Guo","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ren-Di Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mei-Qin Liu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ying Chen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xu-Rui Shen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Shuang Zheng","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kai Zhao","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Quan-Jiao Chen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lin-Lin Liu","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Yan","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fa-Xian Zhan","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan-Yi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng-Li Shi","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"systems biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.10.20017145","rel_title":"Using text mining to track outbreak trends in global surveillance of emerging diseases: ProMED-mail","rel_date":"2020-01-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.10.20017145","rel_abs":"Objectives: ProMED-mail (Program for Monitoring Emerging Disease, also abbreviated ProMED) is an international disease outbreak monitoring and early warning system. Every year, users contribute thousands of reports that include reference to infectious diseases and toxins, and these reports are then distributed to all subscribers of ProMED. However, the corpus of reports has not been well studied so far. Thus, we propose to apply text mining methods to derive information pertinent to the characterisation of the stage of an epidemic outbreak from the reports. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in ProMED reports in three steps: reports filtering, keywords extraction from reports and finally word co-occurrence network analysis. The keyword extraction was performed with the TextRank algorithm, keywords co-occurrence networks were then produced using the top keywords from each document and multiple network centrality measures were computed to analyse the co-occurrence networks. We used two major outbreaks in recent years, Ebola 2014 and Zika 2015, as cases to illustrate and validate the process. Results: We found that the information structures extracted at different stages of outbreaks from ProMED are consistent with response strategies as well as situation reports of the World Health Organisation. Conclusion: This study shows that ProMED provides large valuable information to characterise the evolution of epidemic outbreaks. Our research presents a pipeline that can extract and organise this information in a meaningful way. It also highlights the potential for ProMED mail to be utilised in monitoring, evaluating and improving responses to outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingxian You","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Expert","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ceire Costelloe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zeyu Zhao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jing-An Cui","author_inst":"Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture"},{"author_name":"Ling Yin","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hao-Rui Si","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bei Li","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chao-Lin Huang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui-Dong Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yun Luo","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hua Guo","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ren-Di Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mei-Qin Liu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ying Chen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xu-Rui Shen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Shuang Zheng","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kai Zhao","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Quan-Jiao Chen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lin-Lin Liu","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Yan","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fa-Xian Zhan","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan-Yi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng-Li Shi","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/782409","rel_title":"Coronavirus Interferon Antagonists Differentially Modulate the Host Response during Replication in Macrophages","rel_date":"2019-09-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/782409","rel_abs":"Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceCoronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (de-conjugating ubiquitin\/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2\/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xufang Deng","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Yafang Chen","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Anna M Mielech","author_inst":"Loyola University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hackbart","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kristina  R Kesely","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Robert  C Mettelman","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amornrat O\u2019Brien","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mackenzie E.
