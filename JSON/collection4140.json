For large scale analysis, we propose a 2-scale lattice extension of the classical SIR-type compartmental model with spatial interactions called the Lattice-SIRQL model. Computational simulations show that global quantifiers are not completely representative of the actual dynamics of the disease especially when mitigation measures such as quarantine and lockdown are applied. Furthermore, using real data of confirmed COVID-19 cases, we calibrate the Lattice-SIRQL model for 105 countries. The calibrated model is used to make country specific recommendations for lockdown relaxation and lockdown continuation. Finally, using an agent-based model we analyse the influence of cluster level relaxation rate and lockdown duration on the spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jithender J.

Situations like physical distancing as well as being constantly tagged as the most vulnerable group could expose older adults to mental and psychosocial burdens. Nonetheless, there is little clarity about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar pandemics in the past on the mental illness, wellbeing, and psychosocial health of the older population compared to other age groups. Objectives: To describe the patterns of older adults' mental and psychosocial health related to acute respiratory disease propagated-type epidemics and pandemics and to evaluate the differences with how other age groups respond. Eligibility criteria: quantitative and qualitative studies evaluating mental illness, wellbeing, or psychosocial health outcomes associated with respiratory propagated epidemics and pandemics exposure or periods (COVID-19, SARS-CoV, MERS, and Influenza) in people 65 years or older. Data source: Original articles published until June 1st, 2020, in any language searched in the electronic healthcare and social sciences database: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, WHO Global literature on coronavirus disease database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (  - CNKI). Furthermore, EPPI Centre's COVID-19 living systematic map and the publicly available publication list of the COVID-19 living systematic review will be incorporated for preprints and recent COVID-19 publications. Data extraction: Two independent reviewers will extract predefined parameters. The risk of bias will be assessed. Data synthesis: Data synthesis will be performed according to study type and design, type of epidemic and pandemic, types of outcomes (mental health and psychosocial outcomes), and participant characteristics (e.g., sex, race, age, socioeconomic status, food security, presence of dependency in daily life activities independent\/dependent older adults). Comparison between sex, race, and other age groups will be performed qualitatively, and quantitatively if enough data is available. The risk of bias and study heterogeneity will be reported for quantitative studies. Conclusion: This study will provide information to take actions to address potential mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults and to understand responses on this age group. Furthermore, it will be useful to identify potential groups that are more vulnerable or resilient to the mental-health challenges of the current worldwide pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose M Aravena","author_inst":"Department of Social & Behavioral Sciences, School of Public Health, Yale University."},{"author_name":"Cristopher Aceituno","author_inst":"Chilean-German Beneficence Corporation, Santiago, Chile."},{"author_name":"Kate Nyhan","author_inst":"Harvey Cushing \/ John Hay Whitney Medical Library, Environmental Health Sciences, Yale University."},{"author_name":"Kewei Shi","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Yale University."},{"author_name":"Sten Vermund","author_inst":"School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Yale University."},{"author_name":"Becca R Levy","author_inst":"Department of Social & Behavioral Sciences, School of Public Health, Yale University."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123042","rel_title":"THE ERA OF CORONAVIRUS; KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE, PRACTICES, AND BARRIERS TO HAND HYGIENE AMONG MAKERERE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND KATANGA COMMUNITY RESIDENTS.","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123042","rel_abs":"Background China reported the Novel Coronavirus at the end of the year 2019 which was, later on, declared a Pandemic by the WHO. Proper hand hygiene was identified as one of the simplest most cost effective Covid-19 control and prevention measures. It is therefore very important to understand the compliance of the community to hand hygiene. Method A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students of Makerere University and residents of Katanga slum from 17th to 22nd of March, 2020. An interviewer guided questionnaire with questions on knowledge, attitude, practice, and barriers to hand hygiene was used in data collection. The collected data was analyzed using Microsoft office excel 2016 and STATA 15 software. A 95% confidence interval was used and statistical significance was P<0.05. Results Only 8.4% of the participants had good knowledge of hand hygiene. 11.7% of the university students had good knowledge compared to 0.9% of the Katanga residents. 29.0% of the participants had a good attitude while 50.1% had a moderate attitude to hand hygiene. University students were 6.3 times (OR: 6.3, 95%C1: (2.1 18.5), P=0.001) more likely to have good knowledge while Katanga residents were 3.6 times (OR: 3.6, 95%C1: (1.5 8.4), P=0.003) more likely to have good attitude to hand hygiene. Only 19.6% accomplished all the seven steps of handwashing. 38.4% of the participants still greeted by handshaking and 60.1% noted lack of soap as a barrier to hand hygiene and 62.9% reported having more than three barriers to hand hygiene. Participants that had been taught handwashing were more likely to have better hand hygiene knowledge and practice. Conclusion Despite a fair attitude, deficiency of knowledge coupled with many barriers such as Lack of soap hindered the Practice of proper hand hygiene. Public health involvement to promote hand hygiene must be promoted.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julius Nuwagaba","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dave Darsit Ashok","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thomas Balizzakiwa","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Kisengula","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edna Joyce Nagaddya","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Meddy Rutayisire","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20122747","rel_title":"First environmental surveillance for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Japan","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.20122747","rel_abs":"Wastewater-based epidemiology is a powerful tool to understand the actual incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a community because severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, can be shed in the feces of infected individuals regardless of their symptoms. The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200-5,000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 x 103 copies\/L by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the EMV method, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This result could be attributed to higher limit of detection for influent (4.0 x 103-8.2 x 104 copies\/L) with a lower filtration volume (200 mL) compared to that for secondary-treated wastewater (1.4 x 102-2.5 x 103 copies\/L) with a higher filtration volume of 5,000 mL. None of the river water samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Comparison with the reported COVID-19 cases in Yamanashi Prefecture showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the secondary-treated wastewater sample when the cases peaked in the community. This is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Japan.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eiji Haramoto","author_inst":"University of Yamanashi"},{"author_name":"Bikash Malla","author_inst":"University of Yamanashi"},{"author_name":"Ocean Thakali","author_inst":"University of Yamanashi"},{"author_name":"Masaaki Kitajima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Edna Joyce Nagaddya","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Meddy Rutayisire","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123760","rel_title":"Interplay of global multi-scale human mobility, social distancing, government interventions, and COVID-19 dynamics","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123760","rel_abs":"This work quantifies mobility changes observed during the different phases of the pandemic world-wide at multiple resolutions -- county, state, country -- using an anonymized aggregate mobility map that captures population flows between geographic cells of size 5 km2. As we overlay the global mobility map with epidemic incidence curves and dates of government interventions, we observe that as case counts rose, mobility fell and has since then seen a slow but steady increase in flows. Further, in order to understand mixing within a region, we propose a new metric to quantify the effect of social distancing on the basis of mobility.Taking two very different countries sampled from the global spectrum, We analyze in detail the mobility patterns of the United States (US) and India. We then carry out a counterfactual analysis of delaying the lockdown and show that a one week delay would have doubled the reported number of cases in the US and India. Finally, we quantify the effect of college students returning back to school for the fall semester on COVID-19 dynamics in the surrounding community. We employ the data from a recent university outbreak (reported on August 16, 2020) to infer possible Reff values and mobility flows combined with daily prevalence data and census data to obtain an estimate of new cases that might arrive on a college campus. We find that maintaining social distancing at existing levels would be effective in mitigating the extra seeding of cases. However, potential behavioral change and increased social interaction amongst students (30% increase in Reff) along with extra seeding can increase the number of cases by 20% over a period of one month in the encompassing county. To our knowledge, this work is the first to model in near real-time, the interplay of human mobility, epidemic dynamics and public policies across multiple spatial resolutions and at a global scale.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aniruddha Adiga","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Lijing Wang","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Adam Sadilek","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Ashish Tendulkar","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Srinivasan Venkatramanan","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Anil Vullikanti","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Aggarwal","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Alok Talekar","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Xue Ben","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Jiangzhuo Chen","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Samarth Swarup","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Milind Tambe","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123364","rel_title":"Cumulative Active and Recovery Rates Based Criterion for Gradual Lockdown Exit: A Global Observation of SARS Cov-2 Management","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123364","rel_abs":"On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; and at present there are over 6 million cases across the globe. Based on the interim guidelines of WHO, most of the countries opted for social distancing with lockdown as the only way to control the pandemic. This led to Manufacturing shut down, which acted as a spanner in the wheel for international supply chain leading to pressure on governments to review the protocols of the lockdown. We studied epidemiological parameters for 18 countries and obtained crossover time point referring to cumulative case active and case recovery rates and the time point for the peak positive confirmation rate in a time window of 92 days; and linked with the respective governmental decisions. For countries awaiting crossover, time series non-linear models could be used for predicting the crossover point. A sample study was carried out for India. The median time for reaching crossover for 12 countries was 37 days, while peak positive confirmation rate was 30 days after their first intervention. These countries enforced strict lockdown regulations and have shown constant improvement in their recovery rate even after crossover time point. A phase wise relaxation of lockdown is evident after crossover point in most of these countries. The crossover time point with the subsequent increasing recovery rate can be a strategy for lockdown relaxation as evident from the experiences of few countries. Also, we propose a criterion based on cumulative recovery and fatality rate for micro-management of lockdown.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhananjay V Raje","author_inst":"MDS Bio-Analytics, Shankar Nagar, Nagpur"},{"author_name":"Abhay Bajaj","author_inst":"CSIR-NEERI"},{"author_name":"Moumita Chakraborty","author_inst":"MDS Bio-Analytics, Shankar Nagar, Nagpur"},{"author_name":"Hemant J.

To fill this gap, we estimate the adjustments required to extrapolate estimates of the IFR from high- to lower-income regions. Accounting for differences in the distribution of age, sex, and relevant comorbidities yields substantial differences in the predicted IFR across 21 world regions, ranging from 0.11% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 0.95% for High Income Asia Pacific. However, these predictions must be treated as lower bounds, as they are grounded in fatality rates from countries with advanced health systems. In order to adjust for health system capacity, we incorporate regional differences in the relative odds of infection fatality from childhood influenza. This adjustment greatly diminishes, but does not entirely erase, the demography-based advantage predicted in the lowest income settings, with regional estimates of the predicted COVID-19 IFR ranging from 0.43% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 1.74% for Eastern Europe.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Selene Ghisolfi","author_inst":"Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Ingvild Ingvild Almas","author_inst":"Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Justin Sandefur","author_inst":"Center for Global Development"},{"author_name":"Tillman von Carnap","author_inst":"Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Jesse Heitner","author_inst":"Aceso Global"},{"author_name":"Tessa Bold","author_inst":"Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Aggarwal","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Alok Talekar","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Xue Ben","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Jiangzhuo Chen","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Samarth Swarup","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Milind Tambe","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123026","rel_title":"Losing ground at the wrong time: Trends in self-reported influenza vaccination uptake in Switzerland, Heath Survey 2007-2017","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123026","rel_abs":"Objectives We studied time trends in seasonal influenza vaccination and associations with socioeconomic and health-related determinants in Switzerland, overall and in people aged [&ge;]65 years.

In its severe form, patients progress to respiratory failure. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation restrictions and early orotracheal intubation have collapsed health systems due to insufficient intensive care unit beds and mechanical ventilators. COVID-19 dedicated healthcare professionals have high infection rates. This publication describes experimental testing of the Protection and Isolation System for Patients with COVID-19 (PISP\/COVID-19). Method PISP\/COVID-19 is a disposable transparent polyethylene plastic that covers the patient's entire hospital bed, with its internal air aspirated by the hospital's vacuum system attached to a microparticle filter. Experiments validated PISP\/COVID-19's ability to block aerosolized microparticles dissemination. Caffeine was used as a molecular marker, with leakage evaluation through sensors analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The biological marker was synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA, using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) as the detection method. Results PISP\/COVID-19 was effective against molecular and biological markers environmental dispersion in simulations of non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and mechanical ventilation isolation.

The literature regarding the confluence of these global plagues expands at pace. A systematic search of the literature considering COVID-19 and HIV co-infection was performed. After five months, from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were at least thirty-five studies reported from thirteen countries. These ranged from individual case reports and series to cohort studies. Based on studies that could be extrapolated to the general population, co-infected individuals with suppressed HIV viral loads did not have disproportionate COVID-19 sickness and death. At least four patients, newly diagnosed with HIV recovered from COVID-19. Current evidence suggests that co-infected patients should be treated like the general population. This ongoing living systematic evidence map of contemporary primary SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection research provides a platform for researchers, policy makers, clinicians and others to more quickly discover and build relevant insights.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gwinyai Masukume","author_inst":"Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of the Witwatersrand, School of Public Health, Johannesburg, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Witness Mapanga","author_inst":"Non-Communicable Diseases Research (NCDR) Division of the Wits Health Consortium, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Sou"},{"author_name":"Doreen Sindisiwe van Zyl","author_inst":"Private practitioner, Johannesburg, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Ivano Alogna","author_inst":"British Institute of International and Comparative Law"},{"author_name":"Alessio Alogna","author_inst":"Charite University Hospital"},{"author_name":"San-Lin You","author_inst":"Fu Jen catholic university"},{"author_name":"Aparecida Maria Catai","author_inst":"Sao Carlos Federal University, Department of Physiotherapy"},{"author_name":"Valeria AP Lorenzo","author_inst":"Sao Carlos Federal University, Department of Physiotherapy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gilberto Ferreira","author_inst":"Sao Carlos Federal University, Department of Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Jiangzhuo Chen","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Samarth Swarup","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Milind Tambe","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hiv aids"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20122820","rel_title":"A systematic review of convalescent plasma treatment for COVID19","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20122820","rel_abs":"Background. Transfusion of convalescent immune plasma (CP) is commonly used in epidemics. Several articles now describe clinical report data of CP for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 disease. Methods. A systematic literature review was conducted using the NCBI curated COVID-19 related open-resource literature database LitCovid to identify studies using CP as treatment for COVID-19 patients. We retrieved and curated all COVID-19 related patient and treatment characteristics from previously reported studies. A Poisson model was developed to evaluate the association between age of the patients, older age being the most common risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, and recovery time since CP treatment using data extracted from the literature. Results. From 18,293 identified COVID-19 related articles, we included ten studies reporting results of CP treatment for COVID-19 from a total of 61 patients. Decreased symptoms of severe COVID-19 and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were the most direct observations. We found that patients over the age of sixty who received CP treatment for COVID-19 had a significantly prolonged recovery estimated by viral clearance (from 10 to 29 days since first dose of CP) compared to younger patients, who recovered from the infection in less than a week after receiving CP treatment. Conclusions. Limited published results on plasma transfusion treatment for COVID-19 disease with concomitant treatments suggest that CP therapy for COVID-19 is well tolerated and effective. First randomized clinical trial results, however, reveal no improvements in recovery time for elderly patients with severe COVID-19 between standard treatment alone and added with convalescent plasma. Accordingly, we argue that older patients may need a significantly longer time for recovery. Further randomized clinical trial data for COVID-19 with rigorous ethical standards is urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ville N Pimenoff","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Miriam Elfstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Joakim Dillner","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ivano Alogna","author_inst":"British Institute of International and Comparative Law"},{"author_name":"Alessio Alogna","author_inst":"Charite University Hospital"},{"author_name":"San-Lin You","author_inst":"Fu Jen catholic university"},{"author_name":"Aparecida Maria Catai","author_inst":"Sao Carlos Federal University, Department of Physiotherapy"},{"author_name":"Valeria AP Lorenzo","author_inst":"Sao Carlos Federal University, Department of Physiotherapy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gilberto Ferreira","author_inst":"Sao Carlos Federal University, Department of Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Jiangzhuo Chen","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Samarth Swarup","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Milind Tambe","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20122689","rel_title":"The impact of COVID-19 control measures on social contacts and transmission in Kenyan informal settlements","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20122689","rel_abs":"Background Many low- and middle-income countries have implemented control measures against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it is not clear to what extent these measures explain the low numbers of recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths in Africa. One of the main aims of control measures is to reduce respiratory pathogen transmission through direct contact with others. In this study we collect contact data from residents of informal settlements around Nairobi, Kenya to assess if control measures have changed contact patterns, and estimate the impact of changes on the basic reproduction number (R0). Methods We conducted a social contact survey with 213 residents of five informal settlements around Nairobi in early May 2020, four weeks after the Kenyan government introduced enhanced physical distancing measures and a curfew between 7pm and 5am. Respondents were asked to report all direct physical and non-physical contacts made the previous day, alongside a questionnaire asking about the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and control measures. We examined contact patterns by demographic factors, including socioeconomic status. We described the impact of COVID-19 and control measures on income and food security. We compared contact patterns during control measures to patterns from non-pandemic periods to estimate the change in R0. Findings We estimate that control measures reduced physical and non-physical contacts, reducing the R0 from around 2.6 to between 0.5 and 0.7, depending on the pre-COVID-19 comparison matrix used. Masks were worn by at least one person in 92% of contacts. Respondents in the poorest socioeconomic quintile reported 1.5 times more contacts than those in the richest. 86% of respondents reported a total or partial loss of income due to COVID-19, and 74% reported eating less or skipping meals due to having too little money for food. Interpretation COVID-19 control measures have had a large impact on direct contacts and therefore transmission, but have also caused considerable economic and food insecurity. Reductions in R0 are consistent with the linear epidemic growth in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African countries that implemented similar, early control measures. However, negative and inequitable impacts on economic and food security may mean control measures are not sustainable in the longer term.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Quaife","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Gimma","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kashvi Shah","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicky McCreesh","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mwanga","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Beth Kangwana","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Jessie Pinchoff","author_inst":"Population Council, USA"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Austrian","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20121962","rel_title":"TRACKing Excess Deaths (TRACKED): an interactive online tool to monitor excess deaths associated with COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20121962","rel_abs":"Aim: We aimed to describe trends of excess mortality in the United Kingdom (UK) stratified by nation and cause of death, and to develop an online tool for reporting the most up to date data on excess mortality. Methods: Population statistics agencies in the UK including the Office for National Statistics (ONS), National Records of Scotland (NRS), and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) publish weekly data on deaths. We used mortality data up to 22nd May in the ONS and the NISRA and 24th May in the NRS. Crude mortality for non-COVID deaths (where there is no mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate) calculated. Excess mortality defined as difference between observed mortality and expected average of mortality from previous 5 years. Results: There were 56,961 excess deaths and 8,986 were non-COVID excess deaths. England had the highest number of excess deaths per 100,000 population (85) and Northern Ireland the lowest (34). Non-COVID mortality increased from 23rd March and returned to the 5-year average on 10th May. In Scotland, where underlying cause mortality data besides COVID-related deaths was available, the percentage excess over the 8-week period when COVID-related mortality peaked was: dementia 49%, other causes 21%, circulatory diseases 10%, and cancer 5%. We developed an online tool (TRACKing Excess Deaths - TRACKED) to allow dynamic exploration and visualisation of the latest mortality trends. Conclusions: Continuous monitoring of excess mortality trends and further integration of age- and gender-stratified and underlying cause of death data beyond COVID-19 will allow dynamic assessment of the impacts of indirect and direct mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael TC Poon","author_inst":"Usher Institute"},{"author_name":"Paul M Brennan","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kai Jin","author_inst":"Brain Tumour Centre of Excellence, Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonine Figueroa","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mwanga","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Beth Kangwana","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Jessie Pinchoff","author_inst":"Population Council, USA"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Austrian","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123018","rel_title":"Is the psychological well-being of a population associated with COVID-19 related survival?","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123018","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE Immunological mind-body research suggests mental health may also be important in the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of mental health as a protective factor for COVID-19 related mortality in the general population. The second goal was to examine this among populations of countries most affected by COVID-19 related mortality. METHODS Data sources were the Global Burden of Disease report 2017 and publicly reported situational reports of COVID-19. We described variables; calculated the spearman's correlation coefficient, calculated the percentage of the variability of the data that is explained by the association. We explored inter-relationships among other variables: aged 70 or older, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. A correlation matrix with plotted scatter matrix diagrams was produced. RESULTS Across 181 countries, the mean total COVID-19 related survivors per million was 999,949 (sd=125), median=999,993. The variable had a lognormal distribution; the mean mentally healthy per 100,000 was 85,411 (sd=1,871), median=85,634. The test of normality resulted in p-value < 0.001. Correlation of mentally healthy per 100,0000 and totals of COVID-19 related survivors was s=0.29 (n=181, 95% CI 0.16-0.43). The variance explained by the relation between mental healthy and totals of COVID-19 related survivors was 8.4% (2.6-18.5%). Across countries most affected by COVID-19 related mortality s=0.49 (n=45, 0.28-0.70), explaining 24.2% (7.7-49.3%). CONCLUSION A weak association was found between the psychological well-being of a population and COVID-19 related survival. This relationship explained between 2.6 and 18.5% of COVID-19 related survival. For countries most affected by COVID-19 related death, this association was moderate and explained between 7.7 and 49.3%. Confirmation of these important observational findings is needed with future individual patient data research.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederik Feys","author_inst":"Independent researcher"},{"author_name":"Paul M Brennan","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kai Jin","author_inst":"Brain Tumour Centre of Excellence, Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonine Figueroa","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mwanga","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Beth Kangwana","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Jessie Pinchoff","author_inst":"Population Council, USA"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Austrian","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20122226","rel_title":"Different adiposity measures across sex, age, ethnicity, and COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20122226","rel_abs":"We examined the link between BMI and risk of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and risk of COVID-19-related death among UK Biobank participants.

Poisson models with penalised thin plate splines were run relating exposures of interest to test positivity and case-fatality, adjusting for confounding factors. BMI was associated strongly with positive test, and risk of death related to COVID-19. The gradient of risk in relation to BMI was steeper in those under 70, compared with those aged 70 years or older for COVID-19 related death (Pinteraction=0.03).

Meteorological factors alone, including the associated behavior, do not predict seasonality, given substantial climate differences between countries that are subject to flu-like epidemics or COVID-19. Pollen is documented to be allergenic, it plays a role in immuno-activation and defense against respiratory viruses, and seems to create a bio-aerosol that lowers the reproduction number of flu-like viruses. Therefore, we hypothesize that pollen may explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics, including COVID-19, in combination with meteorological variables. We have tested the Pollen-Flu Seasonality Theory for 2016-2020 flu-like seasons, including COVID-19, in the Netherlands, with its 17.4 million inhabitants. We combined changes in flu-like incidence per 100K\/Dutch residents (code: ILI) with pollen concentrations and meteorological data. Finally, a predictive model was tested using pollen and meteorological threshold values, inversely correlated to flu-like incidence. We found a highly significant inverse correlation of r(224)= -0.41 (p < 0.001) between pollen and changes in flu-like incidence, corrected for the incubation period. The correlation was stronger after taking into account the incubation time. We found that our predictive model has the highest inverse correlation with changes in flu-like incidence of r(222) = -0.48 (p < 0.001) when average thresholds of 610 total pollen grains\/m3, 120 allergenic pollen grains\/m3, and a solar radiation of 510 J\/cm2 are passed. The passing of at least the pollen thresholds, preludes the beginning and end of flu-like seasons. Solar radiation is a co-inhibitor of flu-like incidence, while temperature makes no difference. However, higher relative humidity increases with flu-like incidence. We conclude that pollen is a predictor of the inverse seasonality of flu-like epidemics, including COVID-19, and that solar radiation is a co-inhibitor.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martijn J Hoogeveen","author_inst":"Open University Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Eric CM Van Gorp","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ellen K Hoogeveen","author_inst":"Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Nazim Ghouri","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Stuart R Gray","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Celis-Morales","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Colin Berry","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John JV McMurray","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Paul Welsh","author_inst":"University Of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Austrian","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123372","rel_title":"Containment of future waves of COVID-19: simulating the impact of different policies and testing capacities for contact tracing, testing, and isolation","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123372","rel_abs":"We used multi-agents simulations to estimate the testing capacity required to find and isolate a number of infections sufficient to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads within human organs is crucial for developing strategies to prevent viral dissemination. For many viruses, tissue tropism is determined by the availability of virus receptors on the surface of host cells2. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host receptor, yet, their tropisms differ3-5. Here, we found that the cellular receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1), known to bind furin-cleaved substrates, significantly potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, which was inhibited by a monoclonal blocking antibody against the extracellular b1b2 domain of NRP1. NRP1 is abundantly expressed in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, with highest expression in endothelial cells and in the epithelial cells facing the nasal cavity. Neuropathological analysis of human COVID-19 autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 infected NRP1-positive cells in the olfactory epithelium and bulb. In the olfactory bulb infection was detected particularly within NRP1-positive endothelial cells of small capillaries and medium-sized vessels. Studies in mice demonstrated, after intranasal application, NRP1-mediated transport of virus-sized particles into the central nervous system. Thus, NRP1 could explain the enhanced tropism and spreading of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ludovico Cantuti-Castelvetri","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Ravi Ohja","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Liliana Pedro","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Minou Djannatian","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Jonas Franz","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Suvi Kuivanen","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Katri Kallio","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Tugberg Kaya","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Maria Anastasina","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Teemu Smura","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Lev Levanov","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Leonora Szirovicza","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Allan Tobi","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Hannimari Kallio-Kokko","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Pamela Osterlund","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Merja Joensuu","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Frederic Meunier","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Butcher","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Martin Winkler","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Brit Mollenhauer","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Ari Helenius","author_inst":"ETH Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Ozgun Gokce","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.138149","rel_title":"Rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with Deep-UV LED irradiation","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.138149","rel_abs":"The spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections worldwide has raised concerns about the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2.

There is an urgent need for developing effective drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 caused ARDS. However, most researchers cannot perform SARS-CoV-2 related researches due to lacking P3 or P4 facility. We developed a non-infectious, highly safety, time-saving SARS-CoV-2 components induced murine model to study the SARS-CoV-2 caused ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). We also investigated mAbs and inhibitors which potentially neutralize the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19, and found that anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6, anti-TNF, anti-GM-CSF mAbs, p38 inhibitor, and JAK inhibitor partially relieved CSS. Besides, anti-IL-6, anti-TNF, anti-GM-CSF mAbs and inhibitors of p38, ERK, and MPO somewhat reduced neutrophilic alveolitis in the lung. In all, we established the murine model mimic of COVID-19, opening a biosafety and less time-consuming avenue for clarifying the mechanism of ARDS and CSS in COVID-19 and developing the therapeutic drugs.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tingxuan Gu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Simin Zhao","author_inst":"Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Guoguo Jin","author_inst":"The Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengqiu Song","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yafei Zhi","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Ran Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Fayang Ma","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaqiu Zheng","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Keke Wang","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Xin","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Wei Han","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Dong","author_inst":"Wartburg College, Waverly, IA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kangdong Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zigang Dong","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Frederic Meunier","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Butcher","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Martin Winkler","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Brit Mollenhauer","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Ari Helenius","author_inst":"ETH Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Ozgun Gokce","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.07.138800","rel_title":"Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from Bangladesh: insights into the origin, mutation spectrum, and possible pathomechanism","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.07.138800","rel_abs":"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), rages across the world, killing hundreds of thousands and infecting millions, researchers are racing against time to elucidate the viral genome.

Studies on SARS-CoV-2 are being carried out at an unprecedented rate to tackle this threat. Genomics studies, in particular, are indispensable to elucidate the dynamic nature of the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. RNA viruses are marked by their unique ability to undergo high rates of mutation in their genome, much more frequently than their hosts, which diversifies their strengths qualifying them to elude host immune response and amplify drug resistance. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the genomic information of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from two infected Indian patients and explored the possible implications of point mutations in its biology. In addition to multiple point mutations, we found a remarkable similarity between relatively common mutations of 36-nucleotide deletion in ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2. Our results corroborate with the earlier reported 29-nucleotide deletion in SARS, which was frequent during the early stage of human-to-human transmission. The results will be useful to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and itsattenuation for vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shubham Gaurav","author_inst":"IIT Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Shambhavi Pandey","author_inst":"IITG"},{"author_name":"Apurvasinh Puvar","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Tejas Shah","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Madhvi Joshi","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya Joshi","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Sachin Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Yaqiu Zheng","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Keke Wang","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Xin","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Wei Han","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Dong","author_inst":"Wartburg College, Waverly, IA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kangdong Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zigang Dong","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Frederic Meunier","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Butcher","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Martin Winkler","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Brit Mollenhauer","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Ari Helenius","author_inst":"ETH Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Ozgun Gokce","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20116012","rel_title":"Cremation based estimates suggest significant under- and delayed reporting of COVID-19 epidemic data in Wuhan and China","rel_date":"2020-06-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20116012","rel_abs":"Background: Epidemiological data provide important information for decision making. COVID-19 statistics from China fall outside of recognized and accepted medical norms. As the epicenter of the COVID-19 initial outbreak, the epidemiological information from Wuhan affects the response and preparation of other parts of China and rest of the world. Here we estimated the incidence, death and starting time of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and China based on medical literature from China, official and non-official Chinese data sources. Methods: Data sources included literature on COVID-19 in China, official Chinese government figures, state-run and non state-run media reports. Our estimates are based on investigative media reports of crematory operations in Wuhan, which is considered as a common data end point to life. A range of estimates is presented by an exponential growth rate model from lockdown (Jan 23,2020) until the intervention started to show effects, which was estimated 14.5 days after lockdown. Results: For the cumulative infections and total deaths, under different assumptions of death rates (from 2.5% to 10%) and doubling time 6.4 days, the estimates projected on February 7, 2020 in Wuhan range from 305,000 to 1,272,000 for infections and from 6,811 to 7,223 for deaths - on the order of at least 10 times the official figures (13,603 and 545). The implied starting time of the outbreak is October 2019. Under the assumption of the official 3.14% death rate and doubling time of 2.54 days (which was derived based on Chinese official data), the infection cases reached 2.2 million on February 7. The estimates of cumulative deaths, based on both funeral urns distribution and continuous full capacity operation of cremation services up to March 23, 2020, give results around 36,000, more than 10 times of the official death toll of 2,524. Conclusions: Our study indicates a significant under-reporting in Chinese official data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan. The magnitude of discrepancy between our estimates based on cremation related data and Chinese official figures in early February, the critical time for response to the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests the need to reevaluate official statistics from China and consider all available and reasonable data sources for a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mai He","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"AT&T, Bedminster, NJ 07921, USA"},{"author_name":"Louis P Dehner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Immunology"},{"author_name":"Lucia Dunn","author_inst":"Department of Economics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA"},{"author_name":"Madhvi Joshi","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya Joshi","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Sachin Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Yaqiu Zheng","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Keke Wang","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Xin","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Wei Han","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Dong","author_inst":"Wartburg College, Waverly, IA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kangdong Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zigang Dong","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Frederic Meunier","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Butcher","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Martin Winkler","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Brit Mollenhauer","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Ari Helenius","author_inst":"ETH Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Ozgun Gokce","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121558","rel_title":"Multicenter point-prevalence evaluation of the utilization and safety of drug therapies for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121558","rel_abs":"Background: There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of COVID-19. At the onset of the pandemic, off-label medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during this period. Methods: We conducted a non-interventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with suspected\/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe COVID-19 targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Results: A total of 352 patients from 15 US hospitals were included. Most patients were treated at academic medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven patients (19%) were receiving drug therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug therapies included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir (10%), and interleukin-6 inhibitors (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination therapy. Patients with a history of asthma (14.9% vs. 7%, p=0.037) and those enrolled in clinical trials (26.9% vs. 3.2%, p<0.001) were more likely to receive therapy. Among those receiving COVID-19 therapy, eight patients (12%) experienced an ADR, and ADRs were more commonly recognized in patients enrolled in clinical trials (62.5% vs 22%, OR=5.9, p=0.028). Conclusions: While we observed high rates of supportive care for patients with COVID-19, we also found that ADRs were common among patients receiving drug therapy including in clinical trials.

Thus, it is essential to improve our understanding of COVID-19 transmission and develop more focused and effective strategies. As human mobility drives transmission, data from cell phone devices can be utilized to achieve these goals. Methods: We analyzed aggregated and anonymized mobility data from the cell-phone devices of>3 million users between February 1, 2020, to May 16, 2020 - in which several movement restrictions were applied and lifted in Israel. We integrated these mobility patterns into age-, risk- and region-structured transmission model. Calibrated to coronavirus incidence in 250 regions covering Israel, we evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness in decreasing mortality of applying localized and temporal lockdowns (stay-at-home order). Results: Poorer regions exhibited lower and slower compliance with the restrictions. Our transmission model further indicated that individuals from poverty areas were associated with high transmission rates. Model projections suggested that, counterintuitively, school closure has an adverse effect and increases COVID-19 mortality in the long run, while interventions focusing on the elderly are the most efficient. We also found that applying localized and temporal lockdowns during regional outbreaks reduce mortality compared to nationwide lockdowns. These trends were consistent across vast ranges of epidemiological parameters, possible seasonal forcing, and even when we assumed that vaccination would be commercially available in 1-3 years.

Three highly pathogenic strains have caused zoonotic infections in humans that result in severe respiratory syndromes including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS), and the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, we describe a panel of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, built on a human IgG framework, that bind to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19), compete for ACE2 binding, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2. All antibodies that exhibited neutralization potencies at sub-nanomolar concentrations against SARS-CoV-2\/USA\/WA1 in Vero E6 cells, also bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD), suggesting competition for the host receptor ACE2. These antibodies represent strong immunotherapeutic candidates for treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shane Miersch","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mart Ustav","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Li","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"James B.

Here we report the analysis of conserved interactions between amino acid residues in proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-related viruses. We identified pairs and networks of residue variants that exhibited statistically high frequencies of covariance with each other. While these interactions are likely key to both protein structure and other protein-protein interactions, we have also found that they can be used to provide a new computational approach (CoVariance-based Phylogeny Analysis) for understanding viral evolution and adaptation. Our data provide evidence that the evolutionary processes that converted a bat virus into human pathogen occurred through recombination with other viruses in combination with new adaptive mutations important for entry into human cells.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William P Robins","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"John J Mekalanos","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Li","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"James B.

This study observed some differences of bladder cell cluster and their ACE2 expression between OAB mice and healthy mice, indicating the change of infectious possibility and pathway under overactive bladder (OAB) circumstance.\n\nMaterial and methodPubic dataset acquisition was used to get ACE2 expression in normal human bladder and mice bladder (GSE129845). We built up over OAB model and studied the impact on cell typing and ACE2 expression. By way of using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique, bladder cell clustering and ACE2 expression in various cell types were measured respectively.\n\nResultIn pubic database (healthy human and mice bladder), ACE2 expression in humans and mice is concentrated in bladder epithelial cells. The disappearance of umbrella cells, a component of bladder epithelial, was found in our OAB model. In the two mouse bladder samples, ACE2 expression of epithelial cells is 34.1%, also the highest of all cell types.\n\nConclusionThe disappearance of umbrella cell may alternate the infection pathway of 2019-nCov and relate to the onset and progression of OAB.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Boyu Xiang","author_inst":"The fifth brigade, Basic medicine of Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiangyu Hu","author_inst":"The fourth brigade, Basic medicine of Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haoxuan Li","author_inst":"The fourth brigade, Basic medicine of Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Li Ma","author_inst":"The fifth brigade, Basic medicine of Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hao Zhou","author_inst":"Urological Surgery Research Institute, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical"},{"author_name":"Ling Wei","author_inst":"Urological Surgery Research Institute, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Ji Zheng","author_inst":"Urological Surgery Research Institute, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical"},{"author_name":"Maria R.
