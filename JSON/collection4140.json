In the current study, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as HCV (MFED 7-9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analysed created by several hundred consecutive energetically favoured stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses - even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base-paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus which is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterised, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represent important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3SY, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.156455","rel_title":"Multi-level proteomics reveals host-perturbation strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV","rel_date":"2020-06-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.156455","rel_abs":"The sudden global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 urgently requires an in-depth understanding of molecular functions of viral proteins and their interactions with the host proteome. Several omics studies have extended our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology, including some focused on proteomic aspects1\u20133. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses manipulate the host we here characterized interactome, proteome and signaling processes in a systems-wide manner. This identified connections between the corresponding cellular events, revealed functional effects of the individual viral proteins and put these findings into the context of host signaling pathways. We investigated the closely related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses as well as the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome of a lung-derived human cell line. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed relationships between the perturbations taking place upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different layers and identified unique and common molecular mechanisms of SARS coronaviruses. The results highlight the functionality of individual proteins as well as vulnerability hotspots of SARS-CoV-2, which we targeted with clinically approved drugs. We exemplify this by identification of kinase inhibitors as well as MMPase inhibitors with significant antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexey Stukalov","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Virginie Girault","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Vincent Grass","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Valter Bergant","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ozge Karayel","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Urban","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Darya A.

Here, we describe an efficient protocol for screening chemical compounds for binding to Mpro using saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) spectroscopy. We characterised the relative affinity of Mpro-binding fragments using STD-NMR, revealing a ~200-fold difference in binding potential. Combined with crystallographic structures of these fragments bound to Mpro, this information can assist ongoing drug design efforts.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anastassia  L.

The relative contribution of viral transmission via fomites is still unclear. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to survive on inanimate surfaces for several days, yet the factors that determine its survival on surfaces are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for human respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Although saliva microdroplets dried out rapidly at all tested RH levels (unlike SM that remained hydrated at RH [&ge;] 57%), survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly higher than in water or SM. Thus, RH and hydration conditions are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely affect physicochemical properties that determine virus survival. The observed high virus survival in dry saliva deposited on surfaces, under a wide range of RH levels, can have profound implications for human public health, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aliza Fedorenko","author_inst":"The Hebrew Universtiy of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Maor Grinberg","author_inst":"The Hebrew Universtiy of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Tomer Orevi","author_inst":"The Hebrew Universtiy of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Nadav Kashtan","author_inst":"The Hebrew Universtiy of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Ozge Karayel","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Urban","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Darya A.

Estimates of disease severity are an essential indicator to inform policy decisions about the intensity and duration of interventions needed to mitigate the outbreak. Here we derive delay-adjusted case fatality rates (aCFR) of CoVID-19 in a middle-income country in South America. We used government-reported time series of CoVID-19 cases and deaths stratified by age group and gender. Our estimates as of May 25, 2020, of the aCFR for men and women are 10.8% (95%CrI: 10.5-11.1%) and 6.5% (95%CrI: 6.2-6.8%), respectively, and an overall aCFR of 9.1% (95%CrI: 8.9-9.3%). Our results show that senior individuals are the most severely affected by CoVID-19, particularly men, with aCFR of almost 60% for those aged 80- years. We found that men have a significantly higher cumulative morbidity ratio than women across most age groups (proportion test, p-value< 0.001), with the exception of those aged 0-9 years. The COVID-19 epidemic is imposing a large mortality burden in Peru. Senior individuals, especially those who are older than 70 years of age, are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cesar Munayco","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Prevencion y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amna Tariq","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Eduardo A Undurraga","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Kenji Mizumoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Dror Dicker","author_inst":"Hasharon campus, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel."},{"author_name":"Aliza Zeidman","author_inst":"Hasharon campus, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel."},{"author_name":"Evgeny Berkov","author_inst":"Hasharon campus, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel."},{"author_name":"Gal Sahaf Levin","author_inst":"The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Boaz Tadmor","author_inst":"Research Authority, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shaul Lev","author_inst":"General Intensive Care Unit, HasHasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel; The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, I"},{"author_name":"Antonio Piras","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Tanzer","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fynn M Hansen","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thomas Engleitner","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Reinecke","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Teresa M.

However, there have been no studies in the UK looking at the effect of COVID-19 work pattern on the provision of cardiology services. We aim to assess the impact of the pandemic on the cardiology services and clinical activity. Methods: We analysed key performance indicators in cardiology services in a single centre in the UK in the intervals prior and during the lockdown to assess for reduction or changes to service provisions. Results: There has been more than 50% drop in patients presenting to cardiology and those diagnosed with myocardial infarction. All cardiology service provisions sustained significant reductions which included outpatient clinics, investigations, procedures and cardiology community services such as heart failure and cardiac rehabilitation. Conclusion: As ischaemic heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death nationally and globally, cardiology services need to prepare for a significant increase in workload in the recovery phase and develop new pathways to urgently help those adversely affected by the changes in service provisions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Fersia","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Sue Bryant","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Rachael Nicholson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Karen McMeeken","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Carolyn Brown","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Brenda Donaldson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jardine","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Valerie Grierson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Whalen","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Alistair Mackay","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Shaul Lev","author_inst":"General Intensive Care Unit, HasHasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel; The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, I"},{"author_name":"Antonio Piras","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Tanzer","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fynn M Hansen","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thomas Engleitner","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Reinecke","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Teresa M.

This study primarily focused on what effect smoking had on hospitalization; however, asymptomaticity and severity were discussed. Data: Data was collected through searches on databases including PubMed and Google Scholar. Eligibility criteria included being RT-PCR verified and including smoking data. Discussion: This study found that smokers were significantly underrepresented in COVID-19 hospitalization on a purely epidemiological level in some areas, including China and Manhattan, but not others: Seattle, Greater New York City Area, and Italy. Furthermore, smokers were equally represented in asymptomatic populations, but smokers will likely experience a more severe manifestation of the disease if they are symptomatic. Further inquiry into possible mechanisms by which the observed epidemiological effect is necessary, as it has implications for recommendations on loosening restrictions on social distancing measures. Conclusions and Recommendations: This study recommends that smokers consider themselves to be at higher risk for COVID-19, as they may experience a more severe manifestation of the disease. Health care providers and policymakers should consider smokers at higher risk as well, as there is evidence to claim that smokers may contract a more severe form of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lachezar Balabanski","author_inst":"none"},{"author_name":"Sue Bryant","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Rachael Nicholson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Karen McMeeken","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Carolyn Brown","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Brenda Donaldson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jardine","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Valerie Grierson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Whalen","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Alistair Mackay","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Shaul Lev","author_inst":"General Intensive Care Unit, HasHasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel; The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, I"},{"author_name":"Antonio Piras","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Tanzer","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fynn M Hansen","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thomas Engleitner","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Reinecke","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Teresa M.

The strict enforcement of this curfew was extended through May 25, with a gradual relaxation beginning on May 1. This report summarizes an assessment of these early mitigation measures on the progression of COVID-19 in the island. Methods and Findings: From March 15 to May 15, 2020, 41,748 results of molecular (RT-PCR) tests were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Of these, 1,866 (4.5%) were positive, corresponding to 1,219 individuals with COVID-19 included in the study. We derived the epidemic growth rates (r) and the corresponding reproductive numbers (R) from the epidemic curve of these 1,219 individuals with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using their date of test collection as a proxy for symptoms onset. We then compared the observed cases with the R-based epidemic model projections had the mitigation measures not been implemented. Computations were conducted in the R packages forecast, incidence and projections. The number of daily RT-PCR-confirmed cases peaked on March 30 (84 cases), showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing secular trend since March 30. The initial exponential growth rate (r) was 17.0% (95% CI: 8.4%, 25.6%), corresponding to a doubling of cases every 4.1 days, and to a reproduction number (Ro) of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.41, 2.39). After March 30, the r value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -3.6% (95% CI: -5.7%, -1.4%), corresponding to a halving of cases every 19.4 days and to an Ro of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97). Had the initial growth rate been maintained, a total of 18,699 (96%CI: 4,113, 87,438) COVID-19 cases would have occurred by April 30 compared with 1,119 observed. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with very effective implementation of early non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as mitigation measures in Puerto Rico. These results serve as a baseline to assess the impact of the transition from mitigation to containment stages in Puerto Rico.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel Valencia","author_inst":"Puerto Rico Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Jose E Becerra","author_inst":"University Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus - Graduate School Public Health - Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Juan C Reyes","author_inst":"University Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus - Graduate School Public Health - Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Kenneth G Castro","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Carolyn Brown","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Brenda Donaldson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jardine","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Valerie Grierson","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Whalen","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Alistair Mackay","author_inst":"DGRI"},{"author_name":"Shaul Lev","author_inst":"General Intensive Care Unit, HasHasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel; The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, I"},{"author_name":"Antonio Piras","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Tanzer","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fynn M Hansen","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thomas Engleitner","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Reinecke","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Teresa M.

Ten telephonic in-depth interviews and a descriptive survey were conducted to obtain experiences of police regarding their combat against Covid-19. Results: PPR (0.01 to 1.12), CRR (0 to 39.22) and CFR (0 to 1.07) have consistently increased and CRR found lower among police than the general population. The qualitative data by analyzing several indicators suggests that there is a higher individual efficacy over collective efficacy among the police force. Further, the long-time fight against Covid-19 had drained police force mentally and physically and this put them in higher risk. Conclusion: Immediate priority interventions like provision of protective gears need to be provided by the government to control the risk of infection among police.

The aim of this study is to investigate if some health indicators might have been useful to understand the capacity of Italian National Health Service to manage the COVID 19 epidemic. We will compare data in two different Italian regions in the Northern part of Italy (Lombardy and Veneto) with the national data to understand if different health strategies might be significant to explain different patterns of COVID 19 epidemic in Italy. The two regions have two different health policies to face CoViD-2019 epidemic. To face epidemic like this one the answer should be outside hospitals but this means to have general practitioners well-trained and enough healthcare personnel working outside hospitals.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health University of Milan, Italy and Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ester Luconi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Bruno Alessandro Rivieccio","author_inst":"Niguarda Hospital AREU Regional Emergency Service Agency, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Marano","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elena Pariani","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health University of Milan, Italy and Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luisa Romano'","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health University of Milan, Italy and Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Auxilia","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Nicolussi","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Micheletti","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Manzi","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Salini","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences \"L.

Several observational studies have found an association between the A blood group and an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the O blood group appears to be protective. Objective: To investigate the frequency and clinical course of COVID-19 in a large sample of patients who had undergone TAVR and to determine the associations of the ABO blood group with disease occurrence and outcomes. Methods: Patients who had undergone TAVR between 2010 and 2019 were included in this study and followed-up through the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The main outcomes were the occurrence and severity (hospitalization and\/or death) of COVID-19 and their association with the ABO blood group. Results: Of the 1125 patients who had undergone TAVR, 403 (36%) died before January 1, 2020, and 20 (1.8%) were lost to follow-up. The study sample therefore consisted of 702 patients. Among them, we identified 22 cases (3.1%) with COVID-19. Fourteen patients (63.6%) were hospitalized or died of disease. Multivariate analysis identified the A blood group (versus others) as the only independent predictor of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone TAVR (odds ratio [OR] = 6.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.11-18.92; p=0.001). The A blood group (versus others; OR = 8.27; 95% CI = 1.83-37.43, p=0.006) and a history of cancer (OR = 4.99; 95% CI = 1.64-15.27, p = 0.005) were significantly and independently associated with disease severity (hospitalization and\/or death). Conclusions: Patients who had undergone TAVR are vulnerable to COVID-19. The subgroup with the A blood group was especially prone to develop the disease and showed unfavorable outcomes.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marion Kibler","author_inst":"University Hospital Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Adrien Carmona","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Marchandot","author_inst":"University Hospital Of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Kensuke Matsushita","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Antonin Trimaille","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Mohamad Kanso","author_inst":"University Hospital Of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Laurent Dietrich","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Cecile How-Choong","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Albane Odier","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Gennesseaux","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Ophelie Schramm","author_inst":"ophelie.schramm@chru-strasbourg.fr"},{"author_name":"Anne Claire Reydel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Michel Kindo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Minh Hoang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Hess","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Chisato Sato","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Sophie Ohlmann","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Laurence Jesel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Olivier Morel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ohlmann","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard K\u00fcster","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Protzer","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roland Rad","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"John Ziebuhr","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen, Institute of Medical Virology, 35392 Giessen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland & Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pietro Scaturro","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mann","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Pichlmair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129866","rel_title":"Covid-19 rapid test by combining a random forest based web system and blood tests","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129866","rel_abs":"The disease caused by the new type of coronavirus, the Covid-19, has posed major public health challenges for many countries. With its rapid spread, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2019, the disease transmitted by SARS-Cov2 has already caused over 400 thousand deaths to date. The diagnosis of the disease has an important role in combating Covid-19. Proposed method In this work, we propose a web system, Heg.IA, which seeks to optimize the diagnosis of Covid-19 through the use of artificial intelligence. The main ideia is that healthcare professionals can insert 41 hematological parameters from common blood tests and arterial gasometry into the system. Then, Heg.IA will provide a diagnostic report. It will indicate if the patient is infected with SARS-Cov2 virus, and also predict the type of hospitalization (regular ward, semi-ICU, or ICU). We developed a web system called Heg.IA to support decision-making regarding to diagnosis of Covid-19 and to the indication of hospitalization on regular ward, semi-ICU or ICU. This application is based on decision trees in a Random Forest architecture with 90 trees. The system showed to be highly efficient, with great results for both Covid-19 diagnosis and to recommend hospitalization. For the first scenario we found average results of accuracy of 92.891% {+\/-} 0.851, kappa index of 0.858 {+\/-} 0.017, sensitivity of 0.936 {+\/-} 0.011, precision of 0.923 {+\/-} 0.011, specificity of 0.921 {+\/-} 0.012 and area under ROC of 0.984 {+\/-} 0.003. As for the indication of hospitalization, we achieved excellent performance of accuracies above 99% and more than 0.99 for the other metrics in all situations. By using a computationally simple method, based on the classical decision trees, we were able to achieve high diagnosis performance. Heg.IA system may be a way to overcome the testing unavailability in the context of Covid-19. We also expect the system will provide wide access to Covid-19 effective diagnosis and thereby reach and help saving lives.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Clarisse Lins de Lima","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Raquel Bezerra Calado","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Claudio Roberto Bertoldo Junior","author_inst":"REDERA Technologies"},{"author_name":"Jeniffer Emidio de Almeida Albuquerque","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Gomes de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Juarez Escorel de Araujo","author_inst":"Secretaria Municipal de Saude de Paudalho"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Emmanuel de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Anne Claire Reydel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Michel Kindo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Minh Hoang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Hess","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Chisato Sato","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Sophie Ohlmann","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Laurence Jesel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Olivier Morel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ohlmann","author_inst":"University Hospital of Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard K\u00fcster","author_inst":"Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Protzer","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roland Rad","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Oncology and Functional Genomics and Department of Medicine II, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"John Ziebuhr","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen, Institute of Medical Virology, 35392 Giessen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland & Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pietro Scaturro","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mann","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Pichlmair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20129841","rel_title":"Field-deployable, rapid diagnostic testing of saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20129841","rel_abs":"Abstract Rapid, scalable, point-of-need, COVID-19 diagnostic testing is necessary to safely re-open economies and prevent future outbreaks.

Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage amongst HCWs at work is necessary to inform the development of HCW screening programmes to control nosocomial spread. Methods Cross-sectional snapshot survey from April-May 2020; HCWs recruited from six UK hospitals. Participants self-completed a health questionnaire and underwent a combined viral nose and throat swab, tested by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 with viral culture on majority of positive samples. Findings Point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage across the sites was 2.0% (23\/1152 participants), median cycle threshold value 35.70 (IQR:32.42-37.57). 17 were previously symptomatic, two currently symptomatic (isolated anosmia and sore throat); the remainder declared no prior or current symptoms. Symptoms in the past month were associated with threefold increased odds of testing positive (aOR 3.46, 95%CI 1.38-8.67; p=0.008). SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from only one (5%) of nineteen cultured samples. A large proportion (39%) of participants reported symptoms in the past month. Interpretation The point-prevalence is similar to previous estimates for HCWs in April 2020, though a magnitude higher than in the general population. Based upon interpretation of symptom history and testing results including viral culture, the majority of those testing positive were unlikely to be infectious at time of sampling. Development of screening programmes must balance the potential to identify additional cases based upon likely prevalence, expanding the symptoms list to encourage HCW testing, with resource implications and risks of excluding those unlikely to be infectious with positive tests.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Clare","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julie Andrews","author_inst":"Whittington Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Cressida Auckland","author_inst":"Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sarah Beshir","author_inst":"The Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth"},{"author_name":"Saher Choudhry","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust & University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Kerrie Davies","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jane Freeman","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust & University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Andrew Gallini","author_inst":"The Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth"},{"author_name":"Rachel Moores","author_inst":"The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Trupti Patel","author_inst":"Whittington Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Gosia Poznalska","author_inst":"Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alison Rodger","author_inst":"The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust & Institute for Global Health, UCL London"},{"author_name":"Stella Roberts","author_inst":"Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rooney","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust & University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mark Wilcox","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust & University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Simon Warren","author_inst":"The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust & The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"Public Health England & The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"John Ziebuhr","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen, Institute of Medical Virology, 35392 Giessen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland & Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pietro Scaturro","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mann","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Pichlmair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20127605","rel_title":"Longitudinal immune profiling reveals distinct features of COVID-19 pathogenesis","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20127605","rel_abs":"Background The pathogenesis of COVID-19, caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), involves a complex host-virus interaction and is characterised by an exaggerated immune response, the specific components of which are poorly understood. Here we report the outcome of a longitudinal immune profiling study in hospitalised patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and show the relationship between immune responses and severity of the clinical presentation. Methods The Coronavirus Immune Response and Clinical Outcomes (CIRCO) study was conducted at four hospitals in Greater Manchester. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, recruited as close to admission as possible, provided peripheral blood samples at enrolment and sequentially thereafter. Fresh samples were assessed for immune cells and proteins in whole blood and serum. Some samples were also stimulated for 3 hours with LPS and analysed for intracellular proteins. Results were stratified based on patient-level data including severity of symptoms and date of reported symptom onset. Findings Longitudinal analysis showed a very high neutrophil to T cell ratio and abnormal activation of monocytes in the blood, which displayed high levels of the cell cycle marker, Ki67 and low COX-2. These properties all reverted in patient with good outcome. Unexpectedly, multiple aspects of inflammation were diminished as patients progressed in severity and time, even in ITU patients not recovering. Interpretation This is the first detailed longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 patients of varying severity and outcome, revealing common features and aspects that track with severity. Patients destined for a severe outcome can be identified at admission when still displaying mild-moderate symptoms.

Epidemiological analysis and contact tracing together with a thorough investigation of virus variant patterns revealed low and high infection dose transmissions to be involved in transmission events. Methods: Infection control measures were applied to follow up contract tracing. Metagenomic RNA- and SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing was performed from 25 clinical samples for sequence analysis and variant calling. Results: The index patient acquired SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and after his return to Hamburg transmitted it to 2 out of 132 contacts. Virus genomics and variant pattern clearly confirms the initial local cluster. We identify frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 241, 3037, 14408, 23403 and 28881 previously described in Italian sequences and now considered as one major genotype in Europe. While the index patient showed a single nucleotide polymorphism only one variant was transmitted to the recipients. Different to the initial cluster, we observed in household clusters occurring at the time in Hamburg also intra-host viral species transmission events. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 variant tracing highlights both, low infection dose transmissions suggestive of fomites as route of infection in the initial cluster and high and low infection dose transmissions in family clusters indicative of fomites and droplets as infection routes. This suggests (1) single viral particle infection can be sufficient to initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) household\/family members are exposed to high virus loads and therefore have a high risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Susanne Pfefferle","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Thomas Guenther","author_inst":"Heinrich-Pette Institute, Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Robin Kobbe","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Manja Czech-Sioli","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Dominik Noerz","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Rene Santer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Jun Oh","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Stefan Kluge","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Lisa Oestereich","author_inst":"Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Kersten Peldschus","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Daniela Indenbirken","author_inst":"Heinrich-Pette Institute, Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Jiabin Huang","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Adam Grundhoff","author_inst":"Heinrich-Pette Institute, Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Martin Aepfelbacher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Johannes Knobloch","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Marc luetgehetmann","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Nicole Fischer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"- CIRCO","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"John Grainger","author_inst":"Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Tracy Hussell","author_inst":"Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"Public Health England & The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"John Ziebuhr","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen, Institute of Medical Virology, 35392 Giessen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Bern, Switzerland & Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pietro Scaturro","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mann","author_inst":"Department of Proteomics and Signal transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried\/Munich, 82152, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Pichlmair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, 81675 Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20130005","rel_title":"Modeling the Spring 2020 New York City COVID-19 Epidemic: New Criteria and Methods for Prediction","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20130005","rel_abs":"We report here on results obtained using the SIR model to study the spring 2020 COVID-19 epidemic in New York City.

Objectives were to compare anxiety and depression symptoms among people with a pre-existing medical condition, the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), including continuous change scores, proportion with change [&ge;] 1 minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and factors associated with changes, including country. Methods: Pre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were linked to COVID-19 data collected April 9 to April 27, 2020. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale (MCID = 4 points) and depression symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (MCID = 3 points). Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with continuous change and change [&ge;] 1 MCID. Findings: Among 435 participants (Canada = 98; France = 159; United Kingdom = 50; United States = 128), mean anxiety symptoms increased 4.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0 to 5.7). Depression symptom change was negligible (0.3 points; 95% CI -0.7 to 0.2). Compared to France, adjusted scores from the United States and United Kingdom were 3.8 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.9) and 2.9 points higher (95% CI 0.0 to 5.7); scores for Canada were not significantly different. Odds of increasing by [&ge;] 1 MCID were twice as high for the United Kingdom (2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.2) and United States (1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2). Participants who used mental health services pre-COVID had adjusted increases 3.7 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.7) less than other participants. Interpretation: Anxiety symptoms, but not depression symptoms, increased dramatically during COVID-19 among people with a pre-existing medical condition. Increase was larger in the United Kingdom and United States than in Canada and France but substantially less for people with pre-COVID-19 mental health treatment.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brett D.

Aim: Our study aims to study the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak & subsequent lockdown on mental health status of adult Indian population along with identifying the high-risk groups. Methodology: An online survey was conducted during 3rd phase of lockdown gathering details about sociodemographic variables, practice of precautionary measures, awareness and concerns regarding COVID-19 and mental health status of the participants through DASS21 questionnaire from 873 adults. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress were 18.56%, 25.66%, and 21.99% respectively including higher number of participants with mild depression (15.1%) and stress (14.5%) and moderate anxiety (16.3%). Female gender, age <25 years, unemployment, self-business, employed in private sector, lack of formal education, larger household size, parenthood (>2 kids) were associated with increased likelihood of negative mental health. Confidence in physician's ability to diagnose COVID-19 infection, decreased self-perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19, lesser frequency of checking for information on COVID-19 and satisfaction of information received were protective against negative mental health.

We built an analytical framework that emphasized content characteristics, including information completeness, proximity, support seeking type, disease severity, and emotion of help-seeking messages. A quantitative content analysis was conducted with a probability sample consisting of 727 posts. The results illustrate the importance of individual information completeness, high proximity, instrumental support seeking. This study also demonstrates slight inconformity with the severity principle but stresses the power of anger in help-seeking messages dissemination. As one of the first online help-seeking diffusion analyses in the COVID-19 period, our research provides a reference for constructing compelling and effective help-seeking posts during a particular period. It also reveals further possibilities for harnessing social media's power to promote reciprocal and cooperative actions as a response to this deepening global concern.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen Luo","author_inst":"School of Journalism and Communication, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yuru Li","author_inst":"Center for Media, Communication and Information Research, University of Bremen"},{"author_name":"Anfan Chen","author_inst":"School of Humanity and Social Science, University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yulong Tang","author_inst":"Institute of Communication Studies, Communication University of China"},{"author_name":"Scott Patten","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Sami Harb","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital; McGill University"},{"author_name":"Angelica Bourgeault","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lydia Tao","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susan J.

Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is one of them and has been reported from different parts of the world in this pandemic. It is an acute post-infectious polyneuropathy. The review aims to summarize the demographic features, clinical presentation, diagnostics workup, and management strategies of COVID-19 associated GBS reported in the literature. Material and method We searched Medline, PubMed Central, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar using pre-defined keywords, with no time limits and in the English language only. We aimed to include all kinds of manuscripts. The last search was done on 18th May 2020. Demographics, clinical features, diagnostic workup, management, and outcomes were documented in the datasheet. Results We identified 24 cases of COVID-19 associated GBS. Most of the cases were reported from Italy followed by the USA. The majority were males (18 \/24) The age ranged from 23 -84 years. The clinical presentation was typical sensory-motor GBS in most. Nine patients had facial palsy of which five had bilateral involvement. Two patients had bilateral abducent nerve palsy while two presented as paraparetic GBS variant with autonomic dysfunction. Electrodiagnostics was performed in 17 patients only and 12 had typical features of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Intravenous immunoglobulins were the preferred mode of treatment in most of the patient. There was one death, and most were discharged to rehabilitation or home. Conclusion GBS is a frequent neurological complication associated with COVID-19. There is no clear causative relationship between GBS, and COVID-19 at present, and more data are needed to establish the casualty.

To estimate the immediate COVID-19 impact on BP, we have assessed PubMed-indexed articles about COVID-19 (PMIAC) from December 2019 to April 2020. PMIAC have been classified according to publication date, country, and journals for evaluation of time-, region- and scientometric-dependant impact of COVID-19 on BP and have been curated manually (i.e. each entry has been individually analyzed). PMIAC analysis reflects geographic and temporal parameters of outbreak spread. A major BP problem is related to the fact that only 40% of articles report\/review\/analyze data. Another BP weakness is the clusterization of \"highly-trusted\" publications according to countries of origin and \"highly impacting\" journals. Finally, a problem highlighted by COVID-19 crisis is the increased specification of biomedical research. To solve the problem, analytical reviews integrating data from different areas of biology and medicine are required. The data on PMIAC suggest priority of \"what is published\" over \"where it is published\" and \"who are the authors\".

This study was to explore to explore the outcomes of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in four groups of individuals in Wuhan, China. Methods We included the following four groups of individuals who received both COVID-19 IgM\/IgG tests and RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from February 29, 2020 to April 29, 2020: 1470 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Leishenshan Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and Wuhan No. 7 Hospital, 3832 healthcare providers without COVID-19 diagnosis, 19555 general workers, and 1616 other patients to be admitted to the hospital (N=26473). COVID-19 patients who received IgM\/IgG tests <21 days after symptom onset were excluded. Results IgG prevalence was 89.8% (95% CI 88.2-91.3%) in COVID-19 patients, 4.0% (95% CI 3.4-4.7%) in healthcare providers, 4.6 (95% CI 4.3-4.9 %) in general workers, and 1.0% in other patients (p all <0.001 for comparisons with COVID-19 patients). IgG prevalence increased significantly by age among healthcare workers and general workers. Prevalence of IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 31.4% in COVID-19 patients, 1.5% in healthcare providers, 1.3% in general workers, and 0.2% in other patients. Conclusions Very few healthcare providers had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, though a significant proportion of them had been infected with the virus. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, people are unlikely to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against this virus.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei"},{"author_name":"Sanyun Wu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei"},{"author_name":"Huangheng Tao","author_inst":"School and Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei"},{"author_name":"Guang Zeng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei"},{"author_name":"Fuling Zhou","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fangjian Guo","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Xinghuan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lydia Tao","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute of Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susan J.

In this study, using a modified SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model a forecast is generated to predict the trends of COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh. The epidemic model was proposed to accommodate the effects of lockdown and individual based precautionary measures. Data has been taken and analyzed for before and after the movement control order (MCO) and during the MCO period. Modified SIR model in this work offers us an idea how the outbreak would progress based on the current data. It also has estimated that, the peak in terms of the number of infected cases will start from last of June 2020. For the total population (100%) the model gets the peaks at 214875 (infected cases) and 7743 (death cases). For the 90% population, the model shows the peaks at 244356 (infected cases) and 9100 (death cases). Analysis revealed that the lockdown and recommended individual hygiene can slow down the outbreak but unable to eradicate the disease from the society.

Currently, repositioning of old medicines seems the most responsible strategy for potential cure and prevention COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have shown promising efficacy against COVID-19 related pneumonia in clinical studies. However, the mode of drug action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clear. This review aims to gather evidence on antiviral activity and possible mechanism of drug action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2, including in-vitro, animal studies, and studies in humans. Method: A structured search of five bibliographic databases namely; Medline, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar will be undertaken to retrieve studies that describe the antiviral activity and possible mechanism of drug action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2. No restrictions will be placed on publication date, but studies will be limited to only publications in English. Duplication of studies will be removed using EndNote reference manager. Three authors will screen the citations independently based on inclusion criteria. Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias will be done independently. Meta-analysis of selected studies will be done wherever suitable. Ethics and dissemination: Primary data collection will not be involved in this study, hence no need for formal ethical clearance.

In order to compare the performance of such devices, we used Cohen's kappa statistics to assess the level of agreement between RT-PCR and rapid antibody tests. In doing this study, we considered the term of validity after symptom-onset to compare two tests. It takes more than a week to produce antibodies in the body, and RT-PCR thus gives negative result in the convalescent period. On ELISA data from the literature kappa statistics was calculated as 1.0 beyond 10 days after symptom-onset. By taking these factors into consideration, we evaluated agreement with samples collected beyond 10 days of symptom-onset during the active period. We calculated the data from 9 devices, and the kappa statistics for English data were calculated as 0.64 on average. The same finding was 0.75 for Chinese data. These results corresponded with the values from sensitivity & specificity of their reports. Both reports had no details about the collection procedures. Kappa statistics might become even more accurate, if samples could be restricted to ones collected beyond 10 days. Regarding the data from our hospital', the kappa statistics was 0.97 when restricted to samples collected beyond 10 days, which thus showed excellent agreement.
