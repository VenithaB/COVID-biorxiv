Phase I\/II vaccine clinical trials, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent sera have all shown promise. However, these efforts often require extensive screening with the live virus under onerous high biocontainment conditions (BSL-3). Virus neutralization assays (VNAs) remain the gold standard for evaluating the anti-viral potency of antibodies and entry inhibitors. The proliferation of pseudotyped virus systems that can be used in BSL-2 compatible VNAs is a positive development. Yet, there is marked variability between VNAs and how the findings are presented, making inter-group comparisons difficult. To address these limitations, we developed a standardized VNA using VSVdeltaG based CoV-2-S pseudotyped particles (CoV2pp) that can be robustly produced at scale. We used our CoV2pp to interrogate the role of exogenous and endogenous proteases in CoV-2-S mediated entry and standardized our VNA based on that understanding. Our CoV2pp VNA showed a strong positive correlation with CoV2-S ELISA and live virus neutralizations in a validated set of patient sera. Our system was subsequently validated by three independent groups as an out-of-the-box VNA. More than 120 patient sera were screened, and we report descriptive statistics for absolute (abs) IC50, IC80, and IC90 values from all positive patient sera. Lastly, we used our CoV2pp in a screen to identify ultrapermissive 293T clones that stably express ACE2 or ACE2+TMPRSS2. When used in combination with our CoV2pp, we can now produce CoV2pp sufficient for 150,000 standardized VNA\/week.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kasopefoluwa Y.

Reverse Transcriptase- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing usually requires a centralised laboratory and significant infrastructure. We describe the development and diagnostic accuracy assessment of a novel, rapid point-of-care RT-PCR test, the DnaNudge platform CovidNudge test, which requires no laboratory handling or sample pre-processing. Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs are inserted directly into a cartridge which contains all reagents and components required for RT-PCR reactions, including multiple technical replicates of seven SARS-CoV-2 gene targets (rdrp1, rdrp2, e-gene, n-gene, n1, n2 and n3) and human ribonuclease P (RNaseP) as a positive control. Between April and May 2020, swab samples were tested in parallel using the CovidNudge direct-to-cartridge platform and standard laboratory RT-PCR using swabs in viral transport medium. Samples were collected from three groups: self-referred healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 (Group 1, n=280\/386; 73%); patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19 (Group 2, n=15\/386; 4%) and hospital inpatient admissions with or without suspected COVID-19 (Group 3, n=91\/386; 23%). Results Of 386 paired samples tested across all groups, 67 tested positive on the CovidNudge platform and 71 with standard laboratory RT-PCR. The sensitivity of the test varied by group (Group 1 93% [84-98%], Group 2 100% [48-100%] and Group 3 100% [29-100%], giving an average sensitivity of 94.4% (95% confidence interval 86-98%) and an overall specificity of 100% (95%CI 99-100%; Group 1 100% [98-100%]; Group 2 100% [69-100%] and Group 3 100% [96-100%]). Point of care testing performance was comparable during a period of high (25%) and low (3%) background prevalence. Amplification of the viral nucleocapsid (n1, n2, n3) targets were most sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV2, with the assay able to detect 1x104 viral particles in a single swab. Conclusions The CovidNudge platform offers a sensitive, specific and rapid point of care test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 without laboratory handling or sample pre-processing. The implementation of such a device could be used to enable rapid decisions for clinical care and testing programs.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malick M

the worldwide population it is of utmost medical, economical and societal interest to gain reliable predictions on the temporal evolution of the spreading of the infectious diseases in human populations. Of particular interest are the daily rates and cumulative number of new infections, as they are monitored in infected societies, and the influence of non-pharmaceutical interventions due to different lockdown measures as well as their subsequent lifting on these infections. Estimating quantitatively the influence of a later lifting of the interventions on the resulting increase in the case numbers is important to discriminate this increase from the onset of a second wave. The recently discovered new analytical solutions of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model allow for such forecast and the testing of lockdown and lifting interventions as they hold for arbitrary time dependence of the infection rate.

Tocilizumab has an antagonist effect on the IL-6 receptor. With present review and metanalysis, we intend to update the current status on the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of Covid 19 infections in the published literature of case series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following inclusion criteria were used: (i) case series studies (number of reported patients in each study equal to or greater than ten (ii) use of tocilizumab alone or in combination with standard of care therapy (iii) Covid 19 adult patients (iv) the studies with endpoints on all-cause mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, clinical improvements. Data synthesis and statistical analysis Meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model and the DerSimonian and Laird method. RESULTS 18 were selected for the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis). 14 studies were retrospective and 4 were prospective Meta-analysis The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab was 21% (251\/1212) Asymmetric funnel plot in the cylindrical form due to publication bias In conclusion the present synthesis provide us useful insights with the other available evidence to refine our strategy and equip ourselves effectively with tocilizumab to defeat COVID 19 to save humanity. Limitations The included studies utilized varied doses of tocilizumab (single or double), and duration drug availability issues emerged in some centers, which may have influenced both sample sizes and study designs. Clinical implications: Incorporated studies without control groups into systematic reviews and quantitative synthesis especially when there are no other studies to consider can provide information for formulating effective treatment strategies for management of COVID 19 infections through the use of tocilizumab.

Results: Patients adherent to social distancing measures spent more time in sedentary behavior (1.1 hours\/day [95%CI: 0.1, 2.2]; p=0.045) and less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (-12.2 min\/day [95%CI: -23.8, -0.6]; p=0.040) compared to non-adherent ones. No difference was observed for light-intensity physical activity. Bland-Altman analysis comparing objective and subjective physical activity estimates showed a bias for time spent in sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of 2.8 hours\/day and 8.5 min\/day, respectively. Conclusion: Post-bariatric patients who were adherent to social distancing measures due to the Covid-19 outbreak were more inactive and sedentary than non-adherent ones. Additionally, questionnaire data widely underestimated sedentary behavior. Strategies to increase or at least sustain physical activity levels in post-bariatric patients exposed to social distancing measures are necessary during the Covid-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Rezende","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana Jessica Pinto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Karla Fabiana Goessler","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carolina Nicoletti","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sofia Mendes Sieczkowska","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Kamila Meireles","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Perri Esteves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rafael Genario","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gersiel Oliveira","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marco Aurelio Santo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cleva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Hamilton Roschel","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Gualano","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jiayang Sun","author_inst":"DnaNudge Ltd, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College White City Campus, London"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Flower","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Judith Bedzo-Nutakor","author_inst":"DnaNudge Ltd, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College White City Campus, London"},{"author_name":"Maisarah Amran","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom."},{"author_name":"Rachael Quinlan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Keira Skolimowska","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Robert Klaber","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gary Davies","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"David Muir","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"sports medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20171256","rel_title":"Has COVID-19 Hurt Resident Education?

Residents have faced significant changes in work schedules, deployment to COVID-19 units, and alterations to didactics. This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on resident perception of their own education within the Nuvance Health Network. Methods: We conducted an observational study assessing resident perception of changes in education and lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey was developed to assess the quality and quantity of resident education during this time and administered anonymously to all residents within the healthcare network. Results: Eighty-four (68%) residents responded to the survey from five different specialties, including general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and radiology. The average change in hours per week performing clinical work was -5.6 hours (SD=16.8), in time studying was +0.02 hours (SD=4.6), in weekly didactics was -1.7 hours (SD=3.1), and in attending involvement was -1.2 hours (SD=2.3). Additionally, 32% of residents expressed concern that the pandemic has diminished their preparedness to become an attending, 13% expressed concern about completing graduation requirements, and 3% felt they would need an additional year of training. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, residents perceived that time spent on organized didactics\/conferences decreased and that attending physicians are less involved in education. Furthermore, the majority of residents felt that the quality of didactic education diminished as a result of the pandemic. Surprisingly, while many residents expressed concerns about being prepared to become an attending, few were concerned about completing graduation requirements or needing an extra year of education. In light of these findings, it is critical to devote attention to the effects of the pandemic on residents' professional trajectories and create innovative opportunities for improving education during this challenging time.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Ostapenko","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samantha McPeck","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Shawn Liechty","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kleiner","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sofia Mendes Sieczkowska","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Kamila Meireles","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Perri Esteves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rafael Genario","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gersiel Oliveira","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marco Aurelio Santo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cleva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Hamilton Roschel","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Gualano","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jiayang Sun","author_inst":"DnaNudge Ltd, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College White City Campus, London"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Flower","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Judith Bedzo-Nutakor","author_inst":"DnaNudge Ltd, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College White City Campus, London"},{"author_name":"Maisarah Amran","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom."},{"author_name":"Rachael Quinlan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Keira Skolimowska","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Robert Klaber","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gary Davies","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"David Muir","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.250258","rel_title":"Inhibition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 main protease by tafenoquine in vitro","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.250258","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the current pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has taken a huge toll on human lives and the global economy. Therefore, effective treatments against this disease are urgently needed. Here, we established a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based high-throughput screening platform to screen compound libraries to identify drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), in particular those which are FDA-approved, to be used immediately to treat patients with COVID-19. Mpro has been shown to be one of the most important drug targets among SARS-related coronaviruses as impairment of Mpro blocks processing of viral polyproteins which halts viral replication in host cells. Our findings indicate that the anti-malarial drug tafenoquine (TFQ) induces significant conformational change in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and diminishes its protease activity. Specifically, TFQ reduces the -helical content of Mpro, which converts it into an inactive form. Moreover, TFQ greatly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture system. Hence, the current study provides a mechanistic insight into the mode of action of TFQ against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Moreover, the low clinical toxicity of TFQ and its strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 should warrant further testing in clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yeh Chen","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hao Yang","author_inst":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Li-Min Huang","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Chuan Wang","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Shin Yang","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Liang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Hui Hou","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Ling Tsai","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Zhen Chou","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Bao-Yue Huang","author_inst":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chian-Fang Hung","author_inst":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Lin Hung","author_inst":"Program of Digital Health Innovation, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Shing Chen","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ping Chiang","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Der-Yang Cho","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, China Medical University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Long-Bin Jeng","author_inst":"School of Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chang-Hai Tsai","author_inst":"School of Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mien-Chie Hung","author_inst":"Drug Development Center, Research Center for Cancer Biology and Center for Molecular Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Keira Skolimowska","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Robert Klaber","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gary Davies","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"David Muir","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.248880","rel_title":"In plain sight: the role of alpha-1-antitrypsin in COVID-19 pathogenesis and therapeutics.","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.248880","rel_abs":"Entry of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by endogenous and exogenous proteases.

We show that SARS-CoV-2 naive serum exhibits significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry. We identify alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) as the major serum protease inhibitor that potently restrict protease-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2. AAT inhibition of protease-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro occurs at concentrations far below what is present in serum and bronchoalveolar tissues, suggesting that AAT effects are physiologically relevant. Moreover, AAT deficiency affects up to 20% of the population and its symptomatic manifestations coincides with many risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the effects that AAT may have on viral entry itself, we argue that the anti-inflammatory and coagulation regulatory activity of AAT have implications for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 tissue restriction, convalescent plasma therapies, and even potentially AAT therapy.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kasopefoluwa Y Oguntuyo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christian S Stevens","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Mohammed NA Siddiquey","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Robert M Schilke","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Woolard","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Zhang","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Joshua A Acklin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Ikegame","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chuan-tien Hung","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jean K Lim","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert W Cross","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Thomas W Geisbert","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Stanimir S Ivanov","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Jeremy P Kamil","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Long-Bin Jeng","author_inst":"School of Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chang-Hai Tsai","author_inst":"School of Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mien-Chie Hung","author_inst":"Drug Development Center, Research Center for Cancer Biology and Center for Molecular Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Keira Skolimowska","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Robert Klaber","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gary Davies","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"David Muir","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174508","rel_title":"Data Mining Approach to Analyze Covid19 Dataset of Brazilian Patients","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174508","rel_abs":"The pandemic originated by coronavirus(covid19), name coined by World Health Organization during the first month in 2020.

We described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to the adopted respiratory strategy. Methods: Population-based cohort study including all COVID-19 patients (26\/02\/2020-18\/04\/2020) within Rimini Italian province. Hospitalized patients were classified according to the maximum level of respiratory support: oxygen supplementation (group Oxygen), NIV (group NIV-only), IMV (group IMV-only), and IMV after a NIV trial (group IMV-after-NIV). Sixty-day mortality risk was estimated with a Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted by age, sex, and administration of steroids, canakinumab, and tocilizumab. Findings: We identified 1,424 symptomatic patients: 520 (36.5%) were hospitalized, the remaining 904 (63.5%) were treated at home with no 60-days death. According to the respiratory support, 408 (78.5%) were assigned to Oxygen, 46 (8.8%) to NIV-only, 25 (4.8%) to IMV-after-NIV, and 41 (7.9%) to IMV-only groups. There was no significant difference in the P\/F at IMV inception among IMV-after-NIV and IMV-only groups (p=0.9). Overall 60-day mortality was 24.2% (Oxygen: 23.0%; NIV-only: 19.6%; IMV-after-NIV: 32.0%; IMV-only: 36.6%; p = 0.165).

G-CSF is both a growth factor and cytokine that initiates proliferation and differentiation of mature granulocytes. However, the clinical impact of neutropenia and G-CSF use in cancer patients, who are also afflicted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains unknown. Methods: An observational cohort of 304 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was assembled to investigate links between concurrent neutropenia (N=55) and G-CSF administration (N=16) on COVID-19-associated respiratory failure and death. These factors were assessed as time-dependent predictors using an extended Cox model, controlling for age and underlying cancer diagnosis. To determine whether the degree of granulocyte response to G-CSF affected outcomes, a similar model was constructed with patients that received G-CSF, categorized into high- and low-response, based on the level of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) rise 24 hours after growth factor administration. Results: Neutropenia (ANC < 1 K\/mcL) during COVID-19 course was not independently associated with severe respiratory failure or death (HR: 0.71, 95% Cl: 0.34-1.50, P value: 0.367) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. When controlling for neutropenia, G-CSF administration was associated with increased need for high oxygen supplementation and death (HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.06-8.28, P value: 0.038). This effect was predominantly seen in patients that exhibited a high response to G-CSF based on their ANC increase post-G-CSF administration (HR: 5.18, 95% CI: 1.61-16.64, P value: 0.006). Conclusion: Possible risks versus benefits of G-CSF administration should be weighed in neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19 infection, as G-CSF may lead to worsening clinical and respiratory status in this setting.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sejal Morjaria","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Allen Zhang","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Anna Kaltsas MD","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Rekha Parameswaran","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Dhruvkumar Patel","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhou","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Predmore","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Rocio Perez Johnston","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Justin Jee","author_inst":"MSKCC"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174524","rel_title":"Mortality Associated With Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174524","rel_abs":"Objective: The need for critical care, hemodynamic support, renal replacement therapy, and mechanical ventilation have emerged as key features of the SARS-nCoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The primary aim of this study was to determine the in-hospital mortality rate of mechanically ventilated patients. We also sought to determine the risk of in-hospital mortality by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and body mass index. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the mortality rate among inpatient adults with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation in the Nuvance Health system between March 1, 2020 and July 17, 2020. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older, had a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, were admitted to hospitals within the Nuvance Health network (7 hospitals), and were on mechanical ventilation at any time during their inpatient stay. Results: Overall mortality in our cohort of 304 patients was 53.3 percent. Multivariable logistic regression including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and BMI demonstrated patients over 71 years old had greater risk of mortality compared to patients ages 61-70, and females had half the risk compared to males. There was no significant difference in risk of mortality given race, ethnicity, or BMI. Conclusions: In adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care, advanced age (>71 years old) and male gender are associated with increased risk of mortality. This information contributes to a collective body of evidence to support ongoing planning and decision-making among clinicians and for directed infection prevention programming.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Zimmerman","author_inst":"Division of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Stroever","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Timothy Burton","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Karri Hester","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Minha Kim","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Ryan Fahy","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Corbitt","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Joann Petrini","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nicastro","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174631","rel_title":"Forecasting United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Through Machine Learning","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174631","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has become a great national security problem for the United States and many other countries, where public policy and healthcare decisions are based on the several models for the prediction of the future deaths and cases of COVID-19. While the most commonly used models for COVID-19 include epidemiological models and Gaussian curve-fitting models, recent literature has indicated that these models could be improved by incorporating machine learning. However, within this research on potential machine learning models for COVID-19 forecasting, there has been a large emphasis on providing an array of different types of machine learning models rather than optimizing a single one. In this research, we suggest and optimize a linear machine learning model with a gradient-based optimizer for the prediction of future COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States. We also suggest that a hybrid of a machine learning model for shorter range predictions and a Gaussian curve-fitting model or an epidemiological model for longer range predictions could greatly increase the accuracy of COVID-19 forecasting.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anaiy Somalwar","author_inst":"BASIS Independent Silicon Valley"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Stroever","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Timothy Burton","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Karri Hester","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Minha Kim","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Ryan Fahy","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Corbitt","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Joann Petrini","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nicastro","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20174888","rel_title":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing health research: an ad hoc survey among investigators in Germany","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20174888","rel_abs":"Objectives: To gain insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing health research projects, using projects from a selected funding programme in Germany as an example. Design: Online survey Setting: Lockdowns and social distancing policies impact upon clinical and public health research in various forms, especially if unrelated to COVID-19. Research institutions have reduced onsite activities, data is often collected remotely, and during the height of the crisis, clinical researchers were partially forced to abandon their projects in favour of front-line care and crisis response. Participants: 120 investigators of health research projects across Germany, performed between 15 and 25 May 2020. Results: The response rate (78%) showed that the survey generated significant interest among investigators. 85 responses were included for analysis, and the majority of investigators (93%) reported that their projects were affected by the pandemic, with many (80%) stating that data collection was not possible as planned, and they could not carry out interventions as planned (67%). Other impacts were caused by staff being unavailable, for example through child or elder care commitments or because of COVID-19 quarantine or illness. Investigators also reported that publications were delayed or not feasible at all (56%), and some experienced problems with PhD or Masters theses (18%). The majority of investigators had mitigation strategies in place such as adjustment of data collection methods using digital tools (46%) or of project implementation in general (46%), others made changes in research design or research questions (27%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted upon health research projects. The main challenge is now to mitigate negative effects and to improve long-term resilience in health research. The pandemic has also acted as a driver of innovation and change, for example by accelerating the use of digital methods.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tanja Bratan","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute of Systems and Innovation Research"},{"author_name":"Heike Aichinger","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute of Systems and Innovation Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Brkic","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute of Systems and Innovation Research"},{"author_name":"Jana Rueter","author_inst":"Medical Sociology, Department for Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christian Apfelbacher","author_inst":"Institute of Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg"},{"author_name":"Julika Loss","author_inst":"Medical Sociology, Department for Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Regensburg; Robert Koch Institute"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Corbitt","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Joann Petrini","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nicastro","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174706","rel_title":"England's Lockdown vs. Sweden's Herd Immunity: A Comparison of the Daily New COVID-19 Cases and Related Deaths Using Comparative Interrupted Time Series Analysis","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174706","rel_abs":"Background: There is a lack of empirical evidence that lockdowns decrease daily cases of COVID-19 and related mortality compared to herd immunity. England implemented a delayed lockdown on March 23, 2020, but Sweden did not. We aim to examine the effect of lockdown on daily COVID-19 cases and related deaths during the first 100 days post-lockdown. Methods: We compared daily cases of COVID-19 infection and related mortality in England and Sweden before and after lockdown intervention using a comparative-interrupted time series analysis. The period included was from COVID-19 pandemic onset till June 30, 2020. Results: The adjusted-rate of daily COVID-19 infections was eight cases\/10,000,000 person higher in England than Sweden before lockdown order (95% CI: 2-14, P=0.01). On the day of intervention (lagged lockdown), England had 693 more COVID-19 cases\/10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 467-920, P<0.001). Compared to the pre-intervention period, the adjusted daily confirmed cases rate decreased by 19 cases\/ 10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 13-26, P<0.001). There was a rate excess of 1.5 daily deaths\/ 10,000,000 person in England compared to Sweden pre-intervention (95% CI: 1-2, P<0.001). The increased mortality rate resulted in 50 excess deaths\/ 10,000,000 person related to COVID-19 in England compared to Sweden on the day of lockdown (95% CI: 30-71, P<0.001). Post-intervention, the rate of daily deaths in England decreased by two deaths\/ 10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 1-3, P<0.001). During phases one and two of lockdown lifting in England, there was no rebound increase in daily cases or deaths compared to Sweden. Conclusion: The lockdown order implemented in England on March 23, 2020, effectively decreased the daily new cases rate and related mortality compared to Sweden. There was no short-term increase in COVID-19 cases and related-deaths after the phases one and two of the lifting of restrictions in England compared to Sweden.

With the rise of potential infections in the healthcare facilities and the transmission nature of the current volantly evolving COVID 19, consistent and correct disinfections of these devices after each use should not be pardoned. This study, therefore, describes the level of stethoscope and non infrared thermometer disinfection practices among physicians and determines its associated factors during the COVID 19 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was circulated using an anonymous and self-reporting questionnaire via Google form with a consent form appended to it. Results: Four hundred twenty-two physicians participated (62.80% medical doctors, 33.65% seniors, and 3.55% residents). The proportion of stethoscope and non Infrared thermometer disinfections after every use was 13.9% (95%CI: 10.9-17.6) and 20.4% (95%CI: 16.7-24.5), respectively. In adjusted analyses, taking COVID-19 training (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 2.52; 95% [Confidence Interval (CI)]: 1.29-4.92) and the availability of stethoscope disinfection materials at the workplace (AOR: 3.03; 95% CI: 1.29-7.10) were significantly increased the odds of stethoscope disinfection after every use. The odds of stethoscope disinfection after every use was significantly decreased for those who reported the use of shared stethoscope (AOR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.92). Among the physicians, disinfection after every use was significantly higher in resident physicians compared to those of general practitioners for both stethoscope (AOR: 4.61; 95%CI: 1.29-16.52) and non Infrared thermometers (AOR: 7.10; 95%CI: 2.30-21.95). Conclusion: Only a wee share of the respondents reported that they have disinfected their stethoscopes and non-infrared thermometers after every use possibly jeopardizing both patients and clinicians safety, particularly during the COVID 19 pandemic and these results must be sternly dealt with. Provisions of training and securing constant and available stethoscope disinfection supplies can significantly increase disinfection practices among the physicians after every use.

In this article, we express concerns about the violation of some of the Open Science principles and its potential impact on the quality of research output. We provide evidence of the misuses of these principles at different stages of the scientific process.

Based on the reverse transcriptase PCR-based CoV screening CoVs of fecal samples and subsequent sequence analysis of the RdRp gene, we identified CoVs in diverse rodent species, comprising Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus latronum, Bandicota indica, Eothenomys miletus, E. eleusis, Rattus andamanesis, Rattus norvegicus, and R. tanezumi. Apodemus chevrieri was a particularly rich host, harboring 25 rodent CoVs. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three groups of CoVs carried by a range of rodents that were closely related to the Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV_HKU24) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV) identified previously. One newly identified A. chevrieri-associated virus closely related to LRNV lacked an NS2 gene. This virus had a similar genetic organization to AcCoV-JC34, recently discovered in the same rodent species in Yunnan, suggesting that it represents a new viral subtype. Notably, additional variants of LRNV were identified that contained putative nonstructural NS2b genes located downstream of the NS2 gene that were likely derived from the host genome. Recombination events were also identified in the ORF1a gene of Lijiang-71. In sum, these data reveal the substantial genetic diversity and genomic complexity of rodent-borne CoVs, and greatly extend our knowledge of these major wildlife virus reservoirs.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"Department of Zoonosis, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xian-Dan Lin","author_inst":"Wenzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hai-Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan Institute of Endemic Diseases Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miao-Ruo Wang","author_inst":"Longquan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Qing Guan","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e9mence Leyrat","author_inst":"Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nicastro","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.248575","rel_title":"Metaviromic identification of genetic hotspots of coronavirus pathogenicity using machine learning","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.248575","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a major threat across the globe.

We identified hotspots across the SARS-CoV-2 genome including previously unappreciated features in spike, RdRp and other proteins. Finally, we integrated pathogenicity genomic profiles with B cell and T cell epitope predictions for enrichment of sequence targets to help guide vaccine development. These results provide a systematic map of predicted pathogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates sequence, structural and immunological features, providing an unbiased collection of genetic elements for functional studies. This metavirome-based framework can also be applied for rapid characterization of new coronavirus strains or emerging pathogenic viruses.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan J Park","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Sidi Chen","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan Institute of Endemic Diseases Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miao-Ruo Wang","author_inst":"Longquan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Qing Guan","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e9mence Leyrat","author_inst":"Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nicastro","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.243303","rel_title":"Furin cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes but is not essential for infection and cell-cell fusion","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.243303","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells by binding to the host cell receptor Ace2 and undergoing virus-host membrane fusion. Fusion is triggered by the protease TMPRSS2, which processes the viral Spike (S) protein to reveal the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a multibasic site at the S1-S2 boundary, which is thought to be cleaved by furin in order to prime S protein for TMPRSS2 processing. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of furin reduces, but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2 cleavage it does not prevent it. SARS-CoV-2 S protein also mediates cell-cell fusion, potentially allowing virus to spread virion-independently. We show that loss of furin in either donor or acceptor cells reduces, but does not prevent, TMPRSS2-dependent cell-cell fusion, unlike mutation of the multibasic site that completely prevents syncytia formation. Our results show that while furin promotes both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cell-cell spread it is not essential, suggesting furin inhibitors will not prevent viral spread.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guido Papa","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Donna Mallery","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Anna Albecka","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Welch","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Jerome Cattin-Ortola","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Jakub Luptak","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"David Paul","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Harvey T McMahon","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

Predeparture serological and viral RT-PCR testing along with repeat testing after return to shore was available for 120 of the 122 persons on board over a median follow-up of 32.5 days (range 18.8 to 50.5 days). A total of 104 individuals had an RT-PCR positive viral test with Ct <35 or seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an attack rate on board of 85.2% (104\/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing of 39 viral genomes suggested the outbreak originated largely from a single viral clade. Only three crewmembers tested seropositive prior to the boat's departure in initial serological screening and also had neutralizing and spike-reactive antibodies in follow-up assays. None of these crewmembers with neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence of bona fide viral infection or experienced any symptoms during the viral outbreak. Therefore, the presence of neutralizing antibodies from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against re-infection (Fisher's exact test, p=0.002).","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amin Addetia","author_inst":"University of  Washington"},{"author_name":"Katharine HD Crawford","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Adam Dingens","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Haiying Zhu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pavitra Roychoudhury","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Meeili Huang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER"},{"author_name":"Alexander Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Richard Pinapati","author_inst":"Nimble Therapeutics Inc, Madison, WI 53719, United States"},{"author_name":"Eric Sullivan","author_inst":"Nimble Therapeutics Inc, Madison, WI 53719, United States"},{"author_name":"Adrian Caciula","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Rafal Tokarz","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Briese","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Lu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"W.

Previously, a few articles have been published with regard to COVID-19 suicides in Bangladesh. However, all these articles talked about sporadic cases of suicides with no clear picture of the holistic overview of suicides in Bangladesh. Herein, we looked into all COVID-19 suicide cases from March 01, 2020, to July 31, 2020, as reported in Bangladeshi media. Our study also reports the risk factors contributing to suicidal incidents. Moreover, we also identified the impact of gender, profession, and COVID-19 diagnosis status on committing suicide. This study will shed light on the topic with a clear understanding of the causalities influencing individuals to suicide. Furthermore, it will help the policymakers to take necessary actions to prevent any further suicides.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sadia Noosrat Boshra","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical professional based on Mohammadpur, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh; Registered Pharmacist, Pharmacy Council of Bangladesh, Dhaka-1000, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mohiminul Islam","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Adam Dingens","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Haiying Zhu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pavitra Roychoudhury","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Meeili Huang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER"},{"author_name":"Alexander Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Richard Pinapati","author_inst":"Nimble Therapeutics Inc, Madison, WI 53719, United States"},{"author_name":"Eric Sullivan","author_inst":"Nimble Therapeutics Inc, Madison, WI 53719, United States"},{"author_name":"Adrian Caciula","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Rafal Tokarz","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Briese","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Lu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"W.

We investigated phenotypic and genetic factors associated with subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been shown to act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. In a meta-analysis of three independent studies including up to 1,471 participants, lower adipose tissue ACE2 expression was associated with adverse cardio-metabolic health indices including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity status, higher serum fasting insulin and BMI, and lower serum HDL levels (P<5.32x10-4). ACE2 expression levels were also associated with estimated proportions of cell types in adipose tissue; lower ACE2 expression was associated with a lower proportion of microvascular endothelial cells (P=4.25x10-4) and higher macrophage proportion (P=2.74x10-5), suggesting a link to inflammation. Despite an estimated heritability of 32%, we did not identify any proximal or distal genetic variants (eQTLs) associated with adipose tissue ACE2 expression. Our results demonstrate that at-risk individuals have lower background ACE2 levels in this highly relevant tissue. Further studies will be required to establish how this may contribute to increased COVID-19 severity.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Sarah El-Sayed Moustafa","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anne U.

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the essential role these functions have to preserve public health. Syndromic surveillance, electronic laboratory reporting in the meaningful use program, and the growth of the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) have created linkages between hospitals, commercial labs, and public health that can collect and organize data, often through EHR and order workflows, to improve the timeliness and completeness of reporting. In theory, the standard data formats and exchange methods provided by meaningful use should enable rapid healthcare data exchange in the setting of disruptive healthcare events like a pandemic. In reality, access to data remains challenging, and even if available, often lack conformity to regulated standards. Objective: We sought to use regulated interoperability standards already in production to generate regional bed capacity awareness, enhance the capture of epidemiological risk factors and clinical variables among COVID-19 tested patients, and reduce the administrative burden of reporting for stakeholders in a manner that could be replicated by other public health agencies. Methods: Following a public health order mandating data submission, we developed technical infrastructure to combine multiple data feeds from electronic health record systems. We measured the completeness of each feed, and the match rate between feeds. Results: A cloud-based environment was created that received data from electronic lab reporting, consolidated clinical data architecture, and bed capacity data feeds from sites. Data governance was planned from the project beginning to aid in consensus and principles for data use. 88,906 total persons from CCDA data among 14 facilities, and 408,741 persons from ELR records among 88 facilities, were submitted. Fields routinely absent from ELR feeds included travel histories, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities. CCDA data provided an improvement in the quality of data available for surveillance and was highly complete with <5% for all records types with the exception of patient cell phone. 90.1% of records could be matched between CCDA and ELR feeds. Conclusions: We describe the development of a city-wide public health data hub for the surveillance of COVID-19 infection. We were able to assess the completeness of existing ELR feeds, augment these feeds with CCDA documents, establish secure transfer methods for data exchange, develop cloud-based architecture to enable secure data storage and analytics, and produced meaningful dashboards for the monitoring of capacity and disease burden. We see this public health and clinical data registry as an informative example of the power of common standards across electronic records, and a potential template for future extension of the use of standards to improve public health surveillance.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bala Hota","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Casey","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anne F McIntyre","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jawad Khan","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shafiq Rab","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Aneesh Chopra","author_inst":"CareJourney"},{"author_name":"Omar Lateef","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer E Layden","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael R Erdos","author_inst":"National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Narisu Narisu","author_inst":"National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Heather M.

Logistic Regression with L1 regularization (LASSO) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were trained using local data at each site, a pooled model with combined data from all five sites, and a federated model that only shared parameters with a central aggregator. Both the federated LASSO and federated MLP models performed better than their local model counterparts at four hospitals.

In light of the recent pandemic, we use Google Search data to explore online interest about COVID-19 and related topics in 20 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Method: Data from Google Trends from 2019\/12\/30 to 2020\/04\/25 regarding COVID-19 and other related topics were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and with national epidemiological indicators. Results: The Latin American and Caribbean countries with the most interest for COVID-19 were Peru (100%) and Panama (98.39%). No correlation was found between this interest and national epidemiological indicators. The global and local response time were 20.2{+\/-}1.2 days and 16.7{+\/-}15 days, respectively. The duration of public attention was 64.8{+\/-}12.5 days. The most popular topics related to COVID-19 were: the country's situation (100{+\/-}0) and coronavirus symptoms (36.82{+\/-}16.16). Most countries showed a strong or moderated (r=0.72) significant correlation between searches related to COVID-19 and daily new cases. In addition, the highest significant lag correlation was found on day 13.35{+\/-}5.76 (r=0.79). Conclusions: Interest shown by Latin American and Caribbean countries for COVID-19 was high. The degree of online interest in a country does not clearly reflect the magnitude of their epidemiological indicators. The response time and the lag correlation were greater than in European and Asian countries. Little interest was found for preventive measures. Strong correlation between searches for COVID-19 and daily new cases suggests a predictive utility that should be investigated by further studies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Jes\u00fas Arag\u00f3n-Ayala","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de San Agust&iacuten de Arequipa, Arequipa, Peru"},{"author_name":"Julissa Copa-Uscamayta","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de San Agust\u00edn de Arequipa, Arequipa, Peru"},{"author_name":"Luis Herrera","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de San Agust\u00edn de Arequipa, Arequipa, Peru"},{"author_name":"Frank Zela-Coila","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de San Agust\u00edn de Arequipa, Arequipa, Peru"},{"author_name":"Cender U Quispe-Juli","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Samuel Lee","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Sulaiman Somani","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Ishan Paranjpe","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Jessica K De Freitas","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Tingyi Wanyan","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Intelligent System Engineering, Indiana "},{"author_name":"Kipp W Johnson","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Mesude Bicak","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Eyal Klang","author_inst":"Institute for Healthcare Delivery Science, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Young Joon Kwon","author_inst":"Department of Neurological Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Anthony Costa","author_inst":"Department of Neurological Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Shan Zhao","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperat"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Miotto","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Scien"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center, New York, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Erwin B\u00f6ttinger","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"The BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Department of Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at M"},{"author_name":"Girish N Nadkarni","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Fei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences.
