First, we apply an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number Rt. We use daily confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, Case-Fatality-Rate (CFR), and infectious time as inputs for the model. Furthermore, we define a Transmission Index (TI) as a ratio between the instantaneous and the maximum value of the effective reproduction number. The value of TI shows the disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual due to current measures such as physical distancing and lock-down relative to a normal condition. Based on the value of TI, we forecast different scenarios to see the effect of relaxing and tightening public measures. Case studies in three countries are provided to show the practicability of our approach.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agus Hasan","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Endah Putri","author_inst":"Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November"},{"author_name":"Hadi Susanto","author_inst":"Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Nuning Nuraini","author_inst":"Institut Teknologi Bandung"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20165464","rel_title":"Risk stratification of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol: development and validation of the 4C Mortality Score","rel_date":"2020-08-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20165464","rel_abs":"Objectives To develop and validate a pragmatic risk score to predict mortality for patients admitted to hospital with covid-19. Design Prospective observational cohort study: ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study (ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium [4C]). Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients recruited between 21 May and 29 June 2020. Setting 260 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. Participants Adult patients ([&ge;]18 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 admitted at least four weeks before final data extraction. Main outcome measures In-hospital mortality. Results There were 34 692 patients included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 31.7%) and 22 454 in the validation dataset (mortality 31.5%). The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea, and C-reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C risk stratification score demonstrated high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: AUROC 0.79; 95% CI 0.78 - 0.79; validation cohort 0.78, 0.77-0.79) with excellent calibration (slope = 1.0). Patients with a score [&ge;]15 (n = 2310, 17.4%) had a 67% mortality (i.e., positive predictive value 67%) compared with 1.0% mortality for those with a score [&le;]3 (n = 918, 7%; negative predictive value 99%). Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (AUROC range 0.60-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73). Conclusions We have developed and validated an easy-to-use risk stratification score based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. This outperformed existing scores, demonstrated utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify inpatients with covid-19 into different management groups. The 4C Mortality Score may help clinicians identify patients with covid-19 at high risk of dying during current and subsequent waves of the pandemic.

clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations. Recently, assays for the large-volume detection of total antibodies (Ab) and immunoglobulin (Ig) G and M against SARS-CoV-2 antigens have been developed, but there are limited data on the diagnostic accuracy of these assays. This study was organized as a Danish national collaboration and included fifteen commercial and one in-house anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays in sixteen laboratories. Sensitivity was evaluated using 150 serum samples from individuals diagnosed with asymptomatic, mild or moderate nonhospitalized (n=129) or hospitalized (n=31) COVID-19, confirmed by nucleic acid amplification tests, collected 13-73 days from symptom onset. Specificity and cross-reactivity were evaluated in samples collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic from > 586 blood donors and patients with autoimmune diseases or CMV or EBV infections. Predefined specificity criteria of [&ge;]99% were met by all total-Ab and IgG assays except one (Diasorin\/LiaisonXL-IgG 97.2%). The sensitivities in descending order were: Wantai\/ELISA total-Ab (96.7%), CUH\/NOVO in-house ELISA total-Ab (96.0%), Ortho\/Vitros total-Ab (95.3%), YHLO\/iFlash-IgG (94.0%), Ortho\/Vitros-IgG (93.3%), Siemens\/Atellica total-Ab (93.2%), Roche-Elecsys total-Ab (92.7%), Abbott-Architect-IgG (90.0%), Abbott\/Alinity-IgG (median 88.0%), Diasorin\/LiaisonXL-IgG (84.6%), Siemens\/Vista total-Ab (81.0%), Euroimmun\/ELISA-IgG (78.0%), and Snibe\/Maglumi-IgG (median 78.0%). The IgM results were variable, but one assay (Wantai\/ELISA-IgM) had both high sensitivity (82.7%) and specificity (99%). The rate of seropositivity increased with time from symptom onset and symptom severity. In conclusion, predefined sensitivity and specificity acceptance criteria of 90%\/99%, respectively, for diagnostic use were met in five of six total-Ab and three of seven IgG assays.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lene Holm Harritshoej","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Shoaib Afzal","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pia R.

Lateral flow immunoassays for antibody testing have been viewed as a cheap and rapidly deployable method for determining previous infection with SARS-CoV-2; however, these assays have shown unacceptably low sensitivity. We report on nine lateral flow immunoassays currently available and compare their titer sensitivity in serum to a best-practice enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and viral neutralization assay. For a small group of PCR-positive, we found two lateral flow immunoassay devices with titer sensitivity roughly equal to the ELISA; these devices were positive for all PCR-positive patients harboring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One of these devices was deployed in Northern Italy to test its sensitivity and specificity in a real-world clinical setting. Using the device with fingerstick blood on a cohort of 27 hospitalized PCR-positive patients and seven hospitalized controls, ROC curve analysis gave AUC values of 0.7646 for IgG. For comparison, this assay was also tested with saliva from the same patient population and showed reduced discrimination between cases and controls with AUC values of 0.6841 for IgG. Furthermore, during viral neutralization testing, one patient was discovered to harbor autoantibodies to ACE2, with implications for how immune responses are profiled. We show here through a proof-of-concept study that these lateral flow devices can be as analytically sensitive as ELISAs and adopted into hospital protocols; however, additional improvements to these devices remain necessary before their clinical deployment.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda Haymond","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Claudius Mueller","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Hannah Steinberg","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Chicago"},{"author_name":"K.

The immune response to this disease is thought to lead to a cytokine storm, which contributes to the severity of illness. There is an urgent need to confirm whether the use of tocilizumab provides a benefit in individuals with COVID-19. Methods A single-center propensity-score matched cohort study, including all consecutive COVID-19 patients, admitted to the medical center who were either discharged from the medical center or expired between March 1, 2020, and May 5, 2020, was performed. Patients were stratified according to the receipt of tocilizumab for cytokine storm and matched to controls using propensity scores. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 132 patients were included in the matched dataset (tocilizumab=66; standard of care=66). Approximately 73% of the patients were male. Hypertension (55%), diabetes mellitus (31%), and chronic pulmonary disease (15%) were the most common comorbidities present. There were 18 deaths (27.3%) in the tocilizumab group and 18 deaths (27.3%) in the standard of care group (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.465 - 2.151; p=1.00). Advanced age, history of myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and malignancy were significantly more common in patients who died. Interpretation The current analysis does not support the use of tocilizumab for the management of cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19. Use of this therapeutic agent should be limited to the context of a clinical trial until more evidence is available.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Tsai","author_inst":"Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset"},{"author_name":"Oumou Diawara","author_inst":"Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset"},{"author_name":"Ronald G Nahass","author_inst":"ID Care"},{"author_name":"Luigi Brunetti","author_inst":"Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Caitlin W Lehman","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Shih-Chao Lin","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Lucia Collini","author_inst":"Santa Chiara Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heather Branscome","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Tuong Vi Nguyen","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Sally Rucker","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Lauren Panny","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Flor","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Raouf Guirguis","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Richard Hoefer","author_inst":"Sentara Dorothy G.

Thus, effective measures are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor environments. In this regard, we have investigated whether a system based on a filter combining Tungsten Trioxide-Based (WO3) photocatalysis and an antiviral fabric treated-copper nanocluster could inactivate SARS-CoV-2. To this purpose, an infectious SARS-CoV-2 suspension was introduced in the upper opening of a closed cylinder containing a WO3 filter and a lightbased system that activates WO3 and the antiviral fabric. From the bottom exit, aliquots of fluid were collected every 10 min (up to 60 min) and tested for their infectivity by means of a viral plaque assay in Vero cells whereas, in parallel, the viral RNA content was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). As we have previously shown for SARS-CoV, a 1:1,000 ratio of plaque forming units (PFU) vs. viral RNA copies was observed also for SARS-CoV-2. After 10 min, the infectious viral content was already decreased by 98.2% reaching 100% inactivation after 30 min whereas the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was decreased of 1.5 log10 after 30 min. Thus, in spite of only a partial decrease of viral RNA, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was completely abolished by the WO3 photocatalysis system by 30 min. These results support the hypothesis that this system could be exploited to achieve SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in indoor environments.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvia Ghezzi","author_inst":"Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Isabel Pagani","author_inst":"Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Guido Poli","author_inst":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University School of Medicine, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Perboni","author_inst":"Nanohub, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Vicenzi","author_inst":"Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Shih-Chao Lin","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Lucia Collini","author_inst":"Santa Chiara Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heather Branscome","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Tuong Vi Nguyen","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Sally Rucker","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Lauren Panny","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Flor","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Raouf Guirguis","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Richard Hoefer","author_inst":"Sentara Dorothy G.

Protein purification of these recombinantly expressed viral antigens [e.g., spike and its receptor binding domain (RBD)] is an important step in the manufacturing process. Simple and high-capacity protein purification schemes for spike, RBD, and CR3022 mAb, recombinantly expressed in CHO and HEK293 cells, are reported in this article. The schemes consist of an affinity chromatography step and a desalting step. Purified proteins were validated in ELISA-based serological tests. Interestingly, extracellular matrix proteins [most notably heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)] were co-purified from spike-expressing CHO culture with a long cultivation time.

Its genome encodes about 29 proteins. Most of the viral proteins are non-structural proteins (NSP) except envelop (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) proteins that constitute the viral nucleocapsid, envelop and surface. We have recently cloned all the 29 SARS-CoV-2 genes into vectors for their expressions in mammalian cells except NSP11 that has only 14 amino acids (aa). We are able to express all the 28 cloned SARS-CoV-2 genes in human cells to characterize their subcellular distributions. The proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly cytoplasmic but some are both cytoplasmic and nuclear. Those punctate staining proteins were further investigated by immunofluorescent assay (IFA) using specific antibodies or by co-transfection with an organelle marker-expressing plasmid. As a result, we found that NSP15, ORF6, M and ORF7a are related to Golgi apparatus, and that ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interestingly, ORF3a distributes in cell membrane, early endosome, endosome, late endosome and lysosome, which suggests that ORF3a might help the infected virus to usurp endosome and lysosome for viral use. Furthermore, we revealed that NSP13 colocalized with SC35, a protein standing for splicing compartments in the nucleus. Our studies for the first time visualized the subcellular locations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and might provide novel insights into the viral proteins biological functions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Ruth Cruz-cosme","author_inst":"Howard University College of Medicine, 520 W Street NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Meng-Wei Zhuang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Dongxiao Liu","author_inst":"Howard University College of Medicine, 520 W Street NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Yuan Liu","author_inst":"Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Shaolei Teng","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Howard University, 415 College St. NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Pei-Hui Wang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Qiyi Tang","author_inst":"Howard University College of Medicine, 520 W Street NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Joseph Price","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"James Grinham","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Adam Brown","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Martin J Nicklin","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"David C James","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Mark J Dickman","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Tuck Seng Wong","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emanuel Petricoin","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Fatah Kashanchi","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Paolo Lanzafame","author_inst":"Santa Chiara Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lance Liotta","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Luchini","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Gong","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Erroll H Rueckert","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Benjamin D Greenbaum","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Nir Hacohen","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Lagana","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Miguel N Rivera","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lynette M Sholl","author_inst":"Brigham and Woman's Hospital"},{"author_name":"James R Stone","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"David T Ting","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vikram Deshpande","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susanne G.

(H)CQ activity was examined in tissue culture cells to determine if their anti-viral benefits or adverse effects might be due to altering host cell pathways. Metabolic analysis revealed (H)CQ inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, likely by sequestering protons needed to drive ATP synthase. This activity could cause cardiotoxicity because heart muscle relies on beta oxidation of fatty acids. However, it might also explain their therapeutic benefit against COVID-19. A new model of SARS-CoV-2 infection postulates virus enters host cell mitochondria and uses its protons for genome release. Oxidative phosphorylation is eventually compromised, so glycolysis is upregulated to maintain ATP levels. (H)CQ could prevent viral infection and\/or slow its replication by sequestering these protons. In support of this model other potential COVID-19 therapeutics also targeted mitochondria, as did tobacco smoke, which may underlie smokers protection. The mitochondria of young people are naturally more adaptable and resilient, providing a rationale for their resistance to disease progression. Conversely, obesity and diabetes could exacerbate disease severity by providing extra glucose to infected cells dependent on glycolysis. The description of (H)CQ function presented here, together with its implications for understanding SARS-CO-V2 infection, makes testable predictions about disease progression and identifies new approaches for treating COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert J.

A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening effects of mediators. Results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing. However, pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice. The results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity. Countries with a higher number of elderly people, employment in the service sector, and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic (e.g., USA, UK, Italy, and Spain). Social distancing measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Mokhlesur Rahman","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"Jean-Claude Thill","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"Kamal Chandra Paul","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"Dongxiao Liu","author_inst":"Howard University College of Medicine, 520 W Street NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Yuan Liu","author_inst":"Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Shaolei Teng","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Howard University, 415 College St. NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Pei-Hui Wang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Qiyi Tang","author_inst":"Howard University College of Medicine, 520 W Street NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Joseph Price","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"James Grinham","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Adam Brown","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Martin J Nicklin","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"David C James","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Mark J Dickman","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Tuck Seng Wong","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emanuel Petricoin","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Fatah Kashanchi","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Paolo Lanzafame","author_inst":"Santa Chiara Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lance Liotta","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Luchini","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Gong","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Erroll H Rueckert","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Benjamin D Greenbaum","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Nir Hacohen","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Lagana","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Miguel N Rivera","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lynette M Sholl","author_inst":"Brigham and Woman's Hospital"},{"author_name":"James R Stone","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"David T Ting","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vikram Deshpande","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susanne G.

However, in most locations the actual number of patients did not reach the projected surge leaving available, unused hospital capacity. As a result, patients may have delayed needed care and hospitals lost substantial revenue. These initial recommendations were made based on observations and worst-case epidemiological projections, which generally assume a fixed proportion of COVID-19 patients will require hospitalization and advanced resources. This assumption has led to an overestimate of resource demand as clinical protocols improve and testing becomes more widely available throughout the course of the pandemic. Here, we present a parametric bootstrap model for forecasting the resource demands of incoming patients in the near term, and apply it to the current pandemic. We validate our approach using observed cases at UCLA Health and simulate the effect of elective procedure cancellation against worst-case pandemic scenarios. Using our approach, we show that it is unnecessary to cancel elective procedures unless the actual capacity of COVID-19 patients approaches the hospital maximum capacity. Instead, we propose a strategy of balancing the resource demands of elective procedures against projected patients by revisiting the projections regularly to maintain operating efficiency. This strategy has been in place at UCLA Health since mid-April.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey N Chiang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ulzee An","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Misagh Kordi","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Brandon Jew","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Clifford Kravit","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"William J Dunne","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ronald Perez","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Neil R Parikh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Drew Weil","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Richard F Azar","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Robert Cherry","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Karen A Grimley","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Samuel A Skootsky","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Christopher E Saigal","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Manuel","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eleazar Eskin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eran Halperin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Paolo Lanzafame","author_inst":"Santa Chiara Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lance Liotta","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Luchini","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Gong","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Erroll H Rueckert","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Benjamin D Greenbaum","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Nir Hacohen","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Lagana","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Miguel N Rivera","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lynette M Sholl","author_inst":"Brigham and Woman's Hospital"},{"author_name":"James R Stone","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"David T Ting","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vikram Deshpande","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susanne G.

Subjects\/Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 66 patients were remotely (via phone call) and in-person (by home visit) assessed for health status and lifestyle habits. Results: Mean age was 47.4 years. Patients were obese grade I (30.0%), II (22.0%), and III (30.0%), and 94.2% had above reference waist circumference values. Sixty-four percent displayed high blood pressure, whereas 24% showed CRP levels above normal range. Nineteen percent of patients reported irregular use of nutritional supplementation and 6.0% reported binge eating habits. Thirty-three exhibited symptoms of depression. Mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms were reported by 27.4% and 11.3% of the patients; 4.5% exhibited suicidal ideation and were referred to a specialist for healthcare. Of relevance, inactive patients (59.6%) had poorer global mental and physical health scores as compared to active peers (both p<0.05). Conclusion: This out-of-hospital screening revealed that the absence of face-to-face health care due to the Covid-19 pandemic is associated with suboptimal status of physical and mental health as well as lifestyle inadequacies among patients who have recently undergone bariatric surgery.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karla Fabiana Goessler","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carolina Ferreira Nicoletti","author_inst":"Univeristy of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Diego Augusto Nunes Rezende","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sofia Mendes Sieczkowska","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Perri Esteves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rafael Genario","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gersiel Nascimento Oliveira-Junior","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Kamila Meireles","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana Jessica Pinto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Michele Nakahara-Melo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cleva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marco Aurelio Santo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"John Kirwan","author_inst":"Pennington Biomedical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Hamilton Roschel","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Gualano","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eleazar Eskin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eran Halperin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Paolo Lanzafame","author_inst":"Santa Chiara Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lance Liotta","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Luchini","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Gong","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Erroll H Rueckert","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Benjamin D Greenbaum","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Nir Hacohen","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Lagana","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Miguel N Rivera","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lynette M Sholl","author_inst":"Brigham and Woman's Hospital"},{"author_name":"James R Stone","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"David T Ting","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vikram Deshpande","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susanne G.

This study aimed to report the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study at three dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. The severity of the COVID-19 cases was assessed based on the WHO interim guidance. Data were collected only from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critical patients required immediate intensive care admission making them unable to respond to the questions. A total of 103 RT-PCR confirmed non-critical COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Most of the patients (71.8%) were male. Mild, moderate and severe illness were assessed in 74.76%, 9.71% and 15.53% of patients respectively. Nearly 52.4% of patients had a co-morbidity, with hypertension being the most common (34%), followed by diabetes mellitus (21.4%) and ischemic heart disease (9.7%). Fever (78.6%), weakness (68%) and cough (44.7%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Other common symptoms included loss of appetite (37.9%), difficulty in breathing (37.9%), altered sensation of taste or smell (35.0%), headache (32%) and body ache (32%). The median time from onset of symptom to attending hospitals was 7 days (IQR 4-10). This study will help both the clinicians and epidemiologists to understand the magnitude and clinical spectrum of COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

Elements included hospital characteristics, clinical definition of MIS-C, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up. We summarized key findings and compared results from centers that had treated >5 patients vs. those that had treated <5 patients. Results: Forty centers of varying size and experience with MIS-C participated. About half (21\/40) of centers required only 1 day of fever for MIS-C to be considered. In the evaluation of patients, there was often a tiered approach. Intravenous immunoglobulin was the most widely used medication to treat MIS-C (98% of centers). Corticosteroids were listed in 93% of protocols for primarily the moderate or severe cases. Aspirin was commonly used including for mild cases, whereas heparin or low molecular weight heparin were used primarily in severe cases. In severe cases, anakinra and vasopressors were frequently recommended. Nearly all centers (39\/40) recommended follow up with cardiology. There were similar findings between centers that had treated >5 patients vs. those that had treated <5 patients. A supplement containing hospital protocols is provided. Conclusion: There are many similarities yet some key differences between hospital protocols for MIS-C. These findings can help healthcare providers learn from others regarding options for managing MIS-C patients.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Dove","author_inst":"Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Preeti Jaggi","author_inst":"Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Kelleman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Mayssa Abuali","author_inst":"St. Christopher's Hospital for Children"},{"author_name":"Jocelyn Ang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Wassim Ballan","author_inst":"Phoenix Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanmit Basu","author_inst":"Comer Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jay Campbell","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sathish Chikkabyrappa","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nadine Choueiter","author_inst":"Children's Hospital at Montefiore"},{"author_name":"Katherine Clouser","author_inst":"Sanzari Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Corwin","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Amy Edwards","author_inst":"UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shira Gertz","author_inst":"Saint Barnabas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rod Ghassemzadeh","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rima Jarrah","author_inst":"Brenner Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sophie Katz","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stacie Knutson","author_inst":"Masonic Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kuebler","author_inst":"Golisano Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Lighter","author_inst":"Hassenfield Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christine Mikesell","author_inst":"C.

We use a survey experiment to examine the prevalence of non-compliance with social distancing in nine countries and test pre-registered hypotheses about individual-level characteristics associated with less social distancing. Leveraging a list experiment to control for social desirability bias, we find large cross-national variation in adherence to social distancing guidelines. Compliance varies systematically with COVID-19 fatalities and the strictness of lockdown measures. We also find substantial heterogeneity in the role of individual-level predictors. While there is an ideological gap in social distancing in the US and New Zealand, this is not the case in European countries. Taken together, our results suggest caution when trying to model pandemic health policies on other countries' experiences.

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel beta-coronavirus. Although antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected early during the infection, several outstanding questions remain to be addressed regarding magnitude and persistence of antibody titer against different viral proteins and their correlation with the strength of the immune response, as measured by serum levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Methods. An ELISA assay has been developed by expressing and purifying the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Soluble Ectodomain (Spike), and full length nucleocapsid protein (N protein). Sera from healthcare workers affected by non-severe COVID-19 were longitudinally collected over four weeks, and compared to sera from patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects for the presence of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies as well as soluble pro-inflammatory mediators in the sera. Results. Specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA assays were high for anti-RBD IgG and IgA (92-97%) and slightly lower for IgM and the Spike and N proteins (70-85%). The ELISA allowed quantification of IgM, IgG and IgA antibody responses against all the viral antigens tested and showed a correlation between magnitude of the antibody response and disease severity. Non-hospitalized subjects showed lower antibody titers and blood pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles as compared to patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU), irrespective of the antibodies tested. Noteworthy, in non-severe COVID-19 infections, antibody titers against RBD and Spike, but not against the N protein, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased within a month after viral clearance. Conclusions. Rapid decline in antibody titers and in pro-inflammatory cytokines may be a common feature of non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that antibody-mediated protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 is of short duration. These results suggest caution in use serological testing to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Margherita Bruni","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Valentina Cecatiello","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Angelica Diaz-Basabe","author_inst":"1.European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy, 2.University of Milan, Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncolo"},{"author_name":"Georgia Lattanzi","author_inst":"1European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy, 2University of Milan, Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology"},{"author_name":"Erika Mileti","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Monzani","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Pirovano","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Rizzelli","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Clara Visintin","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppina Bonizzi","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Giani","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milan-Bicocca, 20126 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marialuisa Lavitrano","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milan-Bicocca, 20126 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Faravelli","author_inst":"The Armenise-Harvard Laboratory of Structural Biology, Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Pavia, 27100 Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Forneris","author_inst":"The Armenise-Harvard Laboratory of Structural Biology, Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Pavia, 27100 Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Flavio Caprioli","author_inst":"1.

Crowded indoor environments with sustained close contact and conversations are a particularly high-risk setting. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis through July 29, 2020 of SARS-CoV-2 household secondary attack rate (SAR), disaggregating by several covariates (contact type, symptom status, adult\/child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, index case sex, number of contacts in household, coronavirus). Findings: We identified 40 relevant published studies that report household secondary transmission. The estimated overall household SAR was 18.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.4%-22.2%), which is higher than previously observed SARs for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We observed that household SARs were significantly higher from symptomatic index cases than asymptomatic index cases, to adult contacts than children contacts, to spouses than other family contacts, and in households with one contact than households with three or more contacts. Interpretation: To prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, people are being asked to stay at home worldwide. With suspected or confirmed infections referred to isolate at home, household transmission will continue to be a significant source of transmission.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zachary J.

After patients are discharged, SARS-CoV-2 recurring cases are reported and the recurrence could profoundly impact patient healthcare and social economics. To date, no data on the effects of medical treatments on recurrence has been published. We analyzed the treatment data of combinations of ten different drugs for the recurring cases in a single medical center, Shenzhen, China. A total of 417 patients were considered and 414 of them were included in this study (3 deaths) with mild-to-critical COVID-19. Patients were treated by 10 different drug combinations and followed up for recurrence for 28 days quarantine after being discharged from the medical center between February and May, 2020. We applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to overcome the rare recurring events in certain age groups and performed Virtual Twins (VT) analysis facilitated by random forest regression for medical treatment-recurrence classification. Among those drug combinations, Methylprednisolone\/Interferon\/Lopinavir\/Ritonavir\/Arbidol led to the lowest recurring rate (0.133) as compared to the average recurring rate (0.203). For the younger group (age 20-27) or the older group (age 60-70), the optimal drug combinations are different, but the above combination is still the second best. For obese patients, the combination of Ribavirin\/Interferon\/Lopinavir\/Ritonavir\/Arbidol led to the lowest recurring rate for age group of 20-50, whereas the combination of Interferon\/Lopinavir\/Ritonavir\/Arbidol led to lowest recurring rate for age group of 50-70. The insights into combinatorial therapy we provided here shed lights on the use of a combination of (biological and chemical) anti-virus therapy and\/or anti-cytokine storm as a potentially effective therapeutic treatment for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Huang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Song Zhai","author_inst":"University of California at Riverside"},{"author_name":"Fangfan Ye","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Song Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manfei Zeng","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"George Way","author_inst":"University of California at Riverside"},{"author_name":"Vipul Madarha","author_inst":"University of California at Riverside"},{"author_name":"Tengfei Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Liping Qiu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zehui Xu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manhua Ye","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xinping Cui","author_inst":"University of California at Riverside"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Liao","author_inst":"UCR"},{"author_name":"Flavio Caprioli","author_inst":"1.

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Three hospitals in China. PARTICIPANTS 274 adult inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the Protocol for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 (Edition 7) of China and confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) RNA testing, were included from three hospitals from Wuhan, Harbin and Beijing, China from 1 December 2019 to 19 April 2020. The Biobank of Myositis Registry Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, provided the plasma of five patients with anti-MDA5 Ab-related dermatomyositis as positive control group. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected from medical records. The anti-MDA5 Ab was determined by an ELISA assay and was verified by immunoblotting analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES In hospital death of all cause. RESULTS The positive rate of anti-MDA5 Ab in patients with COVID-19 was 48.2% (132\/274) and the anti-MDA5 Ab positive patients tended to represent with severe disease (88.6% vs 66.9%, P<0.0001). The titer of anti-MDA5 Ab was significantly elevated in the non-survivals (5.95{+\/-}5.16 vs 8.22{+\/-}6.64, P=0.030) and the positive rate was also higher than that in the survivals (23.5% vs 12.0%, P=0.012). Regarding to severe COVID-19 patients, we found that high titer of anti-MDA5 Ab ([&ge;]10.0 U\/mL) was more prevalent in the non-survivals (31.2% vs 14.0%, P=0.006). Moreover, early profiling of anti-MDA5 Ab could distinguish severe patients from those with non-severe ones. CONCLUSION Anti-MDA5 Ab was prevalent in the COVID-19 patients and high titer of this antibody is correlated with severe disease and unfavorable outcomes. Early screening and serially monitoring of anti-MDA5 Ab titer have the potential to predict the disease progression of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Changzheng Liu","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Clinical Researc"},{"author_name":"Yeming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Center of Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases, China-Japan Frie"},{"author_name":"Geng Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Linghang Wang","author_inst":"Laboratory of Infectious Diseases Center of Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin"},{"author_name":"Tao Jiao","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Chaojun Hu","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Clinical Researc"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Lei","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Li Guo","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Lili Ren","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Mengtao Li","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Clinical Researc"},{"author_name":"Dingyu Zhang","author_inst":"Joint Laboratory of Infectious Diseases and Health, Wuhan Institute of Virology and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital."},{"author_name":"Bin Cao","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Center of Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases, China-Japan Frie"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Gioacchino Natoli","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sebastiano Pasqualato","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marina Mapelli","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Facciotti","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Christine Mikesell","author_inst":"C.

Considering this we conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial for efficacy and safety evaluation of subcutaneous IFN-alpha2b and IFN-gamma administration in patients positive to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We enrolled 19-82 years-old inpatients at the Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana, Cuba. They were hospitalized after confirmed diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either, subcutaneous treatment with a co-lyophilized combination of 3.0 MIU IFN-alpha2b and 0.5 MIU IFN-gamma (HeberFERON, CIGB, Havana, Cuba), twice a week for two weeks, or thrice a week intramuscular injection of 3.0 MIU IFN-alpha2b (Heberon Alpha R, CIGB, Havana, Cuba). Additionally, all patients received lopinavir-ritonavir 200\/50 mg every 12 h and chloroquine 250 mg every 12 h (standard of care). The primary endpoints were the time to negativization of viral RNA and the time to progression to severe COVID-19, from the start of treatment. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Clinical Investigation from the Hospital and the Center for the State Control of Medicines, Equipment and Medical Devices in Cuba. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. Results: A total of 79 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including symptomatic or asymptomatic conditions, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and underwent randomization. Thirty-three subjects were assigned to the HeberFERON group, and 33 to the Heberon Alpha R group. Sixty-three patients were analyzed for viral negativization, of them 78.6% in the HeberFERON group negativized the virus after 4 days of treatment versus 40.6% of patients in the Heberon Alpha R groups (p=0.004). Time to reach the negativization of the SARS-CoV-2 measured by RT-PCR in real time was of 3.0 and 5.0 days for the HeberFERON and Heberon Alpha R groups, respectively. A significant improvement in the reduction of time for negativization was attributable to HeberFERON (p=0.0027, Log-rank test) with a Hazard Ratio of 3.2 and 95% CI of 1.529 to 6.948, as compared to Heberon Alpha R treated group. Worsening of respiratory symptoms was detected in two (6.6%) and one (3.3%) patients in HeberFERON and IFN-alpha2b groups, respectively. None of the subjects transit to severe COVID-19 during the study or the epidemiological follow-up for 21 more days. RT-PCR on day 14 after the start of the treatment was negative to SARS-CoV-2 in 100% and 91% of patients of the combination of IFNs and IFN-alpha2b, respectively. Negativization for HeberFERON treated patients was related to a significant increase in lymphocytes counts and an also significant reduction in CRP as early as 7 days after commencing the therapeutic schedule. All the patients in both cohorts recover by day 14 and were in asymptomatic condition and laboratory parameters return to normal values by day 14 after treatment initiation. Adverse events were identified in 31.5% of patients, 28.5% in the control group, and 34.4% in the HeberFERON group, and the most frequent were headaches (17.4%). Conclusions: In a cohort of 63 hospitalized patients between 19 to 82 years-old with positive SARS-CoV-2, HeberFERON significantly negativized the virus on day 4 of treatment when comparing with IFN-alpha2b. Heberon Alpha R also showed efficacy for the treatment of the viral infection. Both treatments were safe and positively impact on the resolution of the symptoms. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19.

Nasopharyngeal and oral swabs are the main collection tool of biological material used as the source of viral RNA outside a hospital setting. However, limitation in swabs availability, trained health professional with proper PPE and potential risk of aerosols may hinder COVID diagnosis. Self-collection with swabs, saliva and throat wash to obtain oropharyngeal wash has been suggested as having comparable performance of regular swab. We performed throat wash (TW) based surveillance with laboratory heath workers and other employees (LHW) at a laboratory research institute. Methods: Consecutive volunteer testing of LWH and external household and close contacts were included. TW self-collection was performed in 5 mL of sterile saline that was returned to original vial after approximate 5 secs of gargle. RNA extraction and rtPCR were performed as part of routine COVID protocols using Allplex (Seegene, Korea). Results: Four hundred and twenty two volunteers, 387 (93%) LHW and 43 (7%) contacts participated in the survey. One or more positive COVID rtPCR was documented in 63 (14.9% CI95 12%-19%) individuals. No correlation was observed between with direct activities with COVID samples to positivity, with infection observed in comparable rates among different laboratory areas, administrative or supportive activities. Among 63 with detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 59 with clinical information, 58% reported symptoms at a median of 4 days prior to collection, most with mild disease. Over a third (38%) of asymptomatic cases developed symptoms 1-3 days after collection. Although overall CT values of TW were higher than that of contemporary swab tests from hospitalized cases, TW from symptomatic cases had comparable CTs. Conclusions: The study suggests that TW may be a valid alternative to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The proportion of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases is elevated and reinforces the need of universal precautions and frequent surveys to limit the spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giselle Ibette Silva Lopez-Lopes","author_inst":"instituto Adolfo lutz"},{"author_name":"Cintia Mayumi Ahagon","author_inst":"Instituto Adolo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Margarete Aparecida Bonega","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo lutz"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Pereira dos Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo lutz"},{"author_name":"Katia Correa de Oliveira Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Audrey Cilli","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Lincoln Spinazola do Prado","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bernardes Borges da Silva","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Nuria Borges da Luz","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Claudia Patara Saraceni","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Sardinha Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Maria do Carmo Timenetsky","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernando de Macedo Brigido","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Camacho-Rodriguez Hamlet","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Diaz-Galvez Marisol","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto"},{"author_name":"Sin-Mayor Adriana","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Garcia-Sanchez Maura","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Martinez-Martin Sara Maria","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Alonso-Valdes Marel","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Hernandez-Bernal Francisco","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Nodarse-Cuni Hugo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Bello-Garcia Dianela","author_inst":"Faculty Victoria de Giron, Scholl of Medicine;  Havana"},{"author_name":"Beato-Canfuk Abrahan","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Vizcaino-Cesar Mary Tania","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Guillen-Nieto Gerardo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Muzio-Gonzalez Verena","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Laurie Panesar","author_inst":"Stony Brook Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rupal Patel","author_inst":"Atrium Health Levine Children's"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Schuette","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Children's Center"},{"author_name":"Deepa Thacker","author_inst":"Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children"},{"author_name":"Adrina Tremoulet","author_inst":"Rady Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Navivot Vidwan","author_inst":"Norton Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Oster","author_inst":"Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Thoeger G.

An analysis of the relationship between the number of lymphocytes and age revealed that the lymphocyte and subset counts tended to decline with age significantly. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunity declined with age and was associated with survival time in fatal cases. Loss in the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity could be expanded in vitro.

Design: Prospective observational cohort study with in-hospital mortality as the primary outcome. Setting: Five acute care hospitals within a single academic medical system in New York City. Participants: 3,086 hospital inpatients with COVID-19 admitted on or before April 13, 2020 and followed through June 2, 2020. Follow-up till discharge or death was complete for 99.3% of the cohort. Results: The majority of the cohort was male (59.6%). Men were younger (median 64 vs. 70, p<0.001) and less likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension (32.5% vs. 39.9%, p<0.001), diabetes (22.6% vs. 26%, p=0.03), and obesity (6.9% vs. 9.8%, p=0.004) compared to women. Women had lower median values of laboratory markers associated with inflammation compared to men: white blood cells (5.95 vs. 6.8 K\/uL, p<0.001), procalcitonin (0.14 vs 0.21 ng\/mL, p<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (375 vs. 428 U\/L, p<0.001), C-reactive protein (87.7 vs. 123.2 mg\/L, p<0.001). Unadjusted mortality was similar between men and women (28.8% vs. 28.5%, p=0.84), but more men required intensive care than women (25.2% vs. 19%, p<0.001). Male sex was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 1.26, 95% 1.04-1.51) after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and baseline hypoxia. There were significant interactions between sex and coronary artery disease (p=0.038), obesity (p=0.01), baseline hypoxia (p<0.001), ferritin (p=0.002), lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.003), and procalcitonin (p=0.03). Except for procalcitonin, which had the opposite association, each of these factors was associated with disproportionately higher mortality among women. Conclusions: Male sex was an independent predictor of mortality, consistent with prior studies. Notably, there were significant sex-specific interactions which indicated a disproportionate increase in mortality among women with coronary artery disease, obesity, and hypoxia. These new findings highlight patient subgroups for further study and help explain the recognized sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tomi Jun","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sharon Nirenberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kuan-lin Huang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sheng-yong Dong","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-yu Zhong","author_inst":"Gannan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zong-tao Chen","author_inst":"Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nuria Borges da Luz","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Claudia Patara Saraceni","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Sardinha Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Maria do Carmo Timenetsky","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernando de Macedo Brigido","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Camacho-Rodriguez Hamlet","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Diaz-Galvez Marisol","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto"},{"author_name":"Sin-Mayor Adriana","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Garcia-Sanchez Maura","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Martinez-Martin Sara Maria","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Alonso-Valdes Marel","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Hernandez-Bernal Francisco","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Nodarse-Cuni Hugo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Bello-Garcia Dianela","author_inst":"Faculty Victoria de Giron, Scholl of Medicine;  Havana"},{"author_name":"Beato-Canfuk Abrahan","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Vizcaino-Cesar Mary Tania","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Guillen-Nieto Gerardo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Muzio-Gonzalez Verena","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Laurie Panesar","author_inst":"Stony Brook Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rupal Patel","author_inst":"Atrium Health Levine Children's"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Schuette","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Children's Center"},{"author_name":"Deepa Thacker","author_inst":"Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children"},{"author_name":"Adrina Tremoulet","author_inst":"Rady Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Navivot Vidwan","author_inst":"Norton Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Oster","author_inst":"Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Thoeger G.

Individuals' perceptions of the impact of weather can inform their adherence to public health guidelines; however, there is no measure of their perceptions. We quantified Twitter users' perceptions of the effect of weather and analyzed how they evolved with respect to real-world events and time. Materials and Methods: We collected 166,005 tweets posted between January 23 and June 22, 2020 and employed machine learning\/natural language processing techniques to filter for relevant tweets, classify them by the type of effect they claimed, and identify topics of discussion. Results: We identified 28,555 relevant tweets and estimate that 40.4% indicate uncertainty about weather's impact, 33.5% indicate no effect, and 26.1% indicate some effect. We tracked changes in these proportions over time. Topic modeling revealed major latent areas of discussion. Discussion: There is no consensus among the public for weather's potential impact. Earlier months were characterized by tweets that were uncertain of weather's effect or claimed no effect; later, the portion of tweets claiming some effect of weather increased. Tweets claiming no effect of weather comprised the largest class by June. Major topics of discussion included comparisons to influenza's seasonality, President Trump's comments on weather's effect, and social distancing. Conclusion: There is a major gap between scientific evidence and public opinion of weather's impacts on COVID-19. We provide evidence of public's misconceptions and topics of discussion, which can inform public health communications.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marichi Gupta","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Adity Bansal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bhav Jain","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Jillian Rochelle","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Atharv Oak","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Mohammad S.

We develop an agent-based model of social interactions in which the distribution of agents across wards, as well as their travel and interactions are calibrated to real data for Cape Town, South Africa. We characterize the elasticity of various policy interventions including increased likelihood to self-isolate, travel restrictions, assembly bans, and behavioural interventions like washing hands or wearing masks. Even in an informal setting, where agents' ability to self-isolate is compromised, a lockdown remains an effective intervention. In our model, the lockdown enacted in South Africa reduced expected fatalities in Cape Town by 26% and the expected demand for intensive care beds by 46%. However, our best calibration predicts a substantially higher case load, demand for ICU beds, and expected number of deaths than the current best estimate published for Cape Town.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Allan Davids","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Gideon Du Rand","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Co-Pierre Georg","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Tina Koziol","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Joeri Anton Schasfoort","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Mohammad S.

Overall, 96% of the sample reported traveling outside their home for non-employment related services: most commonly cited reasons were essential services (92%) and visiting friends\/family (66%). Use of public transport was reported by 18% of respondents. 68% reported always social distancing indoors and 53% always wearing masks indoors; indoor social distancing was significantly less common among younger vs. older individuals, and race\/ethnicity and income were significantly associated with mask use (p<0.05 for all). 55 participants (5.3%) self-reported ever testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with strong dose-response relationships between movement frequency and SARS-CoV-2 positivity that were significantly attenuated by social distancing. In multivariable analysis, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was negatively associated with the practice of social distancing (adjusted Odd Ratio [aOR]: 0.10; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.03 - 0.33); the only travel associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection was use of public transport (aOR for 7 or more times vs. never: 4.29) and visiting a place of worship (aOR for 3 or more times vs. never: 16.0) after adjusting for social distancing. Conclusions: Using a rapid cost-efficient approach, we highlight the role of movement and social distancing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. Continued monitoring of NPI uptake, access to testing, and the subsequent impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be critical for pandemic control and decisions about reopening geographies.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven J.
