Following the assumption by Mehta and colleagues who exhorted physicians to screen patients with severe COVID-19 for hyperinflammation and investigate immunomodulatory drugs in this setting, we relate our short-term - yet promising - experience regarding IL6 blockade with tocilizumab in 30 selected patients of less than 80 years of age, >5 days of prior disease duration, severe (i.e. requiring strictly over 6L\/min of oxygen therapy) rapidly deteriorating (i.e. increase by more than 3L\/min of oxygen flow within the previous 12 hours) COVID-19-related pneumonia. By comparison with a control group of patients (matched for age, gender and disease severity using the inverse probability of treatment weighted methodology) that did not receive tocilizumab. We demonstrate that, in highly selected patients, IL6 blockade could curb the \"cytokine storm\", prevent ICU admission and the requirement for mechanical ventilation. Notwithstanding the shortcomings of this retrospective small sample-size study, we believe that these preliminary findings support the fostering of research efforts in the fight against COVID-19-induced inflammation, especially before patients require admission to the ICU.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mathilde ROUMIER","author_inst":"FOCH Hospital"},{"author_name":"Romain PAULE","author_inst":"FOCH Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthieu GROH","author_inst":"FOCH Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexandre VALLEE","author_inst":"Hotel Dieu Hospital"},{"author_name":"Felix ACKERMANN","author_inst":"FOCH Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20054262","rel_title":"Pulmonary post-mortem findings in a large series of COVID-19 cases from Northern Italy","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20054262","rel_abs":"Importance. The analysis of lung tissues of patients with COVID-19 may help understand pathogenesis and clinical outcomes in this life-threatening respiratory illness. Objective. To determine the histological patterns in lung tissue of patients with severe COVID-19. Design and participants. Lungs tissues of 38 cases who died for COVID-19 in two hospital of Northern Italy were systematically analysed. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry for the inflammatory infiltrate and cellular components, electron microscopy were performed. Results. The features of the exudative and proliferative phases of Diffuse Alveolar Disease (DAD) were found: capillary congestion, necrosis of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane, interstitial oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia and reactive atypia, platelet-fibrin thrombi. The inflammatory infiltrate was composed by macrophages in alveolar lumens and lymphocytes mainly in the interstitium. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles within cytoplasmic vacuoles of pneumocytes. Conclusions and relevance. The predominant pattern of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients is DAD, as described for the other two coronavirus that infect humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte atypical hyperplasia are frequently found. The main relevant finding is the presence of platelet-fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels; this important observation fits into the clinical context of coagulopathy which dominates in these patients and which is one of the main targets of therapy.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luca Carsana","author_inst":"Pathology Unit, L.

We extended this model to 31 countries outside China experiencing serious COVID-2019 outbreaks. The model well explained the data in our study (R2 >0.95). For infected cases, the semi-saturation period (SSP) ranges from 63 to 170 days (March 3 to June 18). The logistic growth rate of infected cases is positively correlated with that of recovered cases, and the same holds for the SSP. According to the linear connection between the growth rules for infected and recovered cases identified from the Chinese data, we predicted that the SSP of the recovered cases outside China ranges from 82 to 196 days (March 22 to July 8).

While reducing mortality, these measures result in severe economic repercussions, and inhibit the development of herd immunity. Until an effective vaccine will be available, we propose an alternative approach, akin to avalanche control at ski resorts, a practice which intentionally triggers small avalanches in order to prevent a singular catastrophic one. Its main goal is to approach herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with lower mortality rates and lower demand for critical health-care resources. According to this approach, individuals whose probability of developing serious health conditions is low (i.e. 20-49 years old with no comorbidities) will be offered the option to be voluntarily exposed to the virus under controlled supervision, and will then be issued 'immunity certificates' if they are confirmed to have developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Using a compartmental model we examine the implications of the controlled avalanche (CA) strategy over the population in Israel. We compare four scenarios: in two scenarios the CA program is applied to the low-risk population (with the rest of the population subject to mitigation measures), followed by mitigation for the entire population or by uncontrolled spread. These are compared to mitigated and uncontrolled scenarios without the CA program. We discuss the economic, ethical and public health implications of the CA strategy. Findings: We show that compared to mitigation of the entire population, the CA strategy reduces the overall mortality by 43%, reduces the maximum number of people in need for ICUs by 62% and decreases the time required for release of 50% of the low-risk population by more than 2 months. Interpretation: This study suggests an ethically acceptable practice, that enables reaching herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with low mortality and minimal economic damage.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eyal Klement","author_inst":"Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Alon Klement","author_inst":"Buchmann Faculty of Law, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"},{"author_name":"David Chinitz","author_inst":"Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Alon Harel","author_inst":"Phillip and Estelle Mizock Chair in Administrative and Criminal Law, The Faculty of Law, the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eyal Fattal","author_inst":"Department of Applied Mathematics, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ziv Klausner","author_inst":"Department of Applied Mathematics, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Roberto Rech","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Colombo","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Spinello Antinori","author_inst":"Dept.

Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and how this varies between countries may inform the design of possible strategies to shield those at highest risk. Methods We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease by age (5-year age groups), sex and country (n=188) based on prevalence data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 2017 and United Nations population estimates for 2020. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at-risk because of their age, using thresholds from 50-70 years. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 disease was determined by mapping conditions listed in GBD to the guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and US. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. Results We estimate that 1.7 (1.0 - 2.4) billion individuals (22% [15-28%] of the global population) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The share of the population at increased risk ranges from 16% in Africa to 31% in Europe. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic respiratory disease (CRD) were the most prevalent conditions in males and females aged 50+ years. African countries with a high prevalence of HIV\/AIDS and Island countries with a high prevalence of diabetes, also had a high share of the population at increased risk. The prevalence of multimorbidity (>1 underlying conditions) was three times higher in Europe than in Africa (10% vs 3%). Conclusion Based on current guidelines and prevalence data from GBD, we estimate that one in five individuals worldwide has a condition that is on the list of those at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. However, for many of these individuals the underlying condition will be undiagnosed or not severe enough to be captured in health systems, and in some cases the increase in risk may be quite modest. There is an urgent need for robust analyses of the risks associated with different underlying conditions so that countries can identify the highest risk groups and develop targeted shielding policies to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Clark","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Warren-Gash","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Edinburgh University"},{"author_name":"Harry HX Wang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Stewart W Mercer","author_inst":"Edinburgh University"},{"author_name":"Colin Sanderson","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Martin McKee","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Christopher Troeger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kanyin I Ong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Francesco Checchi","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Pablo Perel","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sarah Joseph","author_inst":"IAVI"},{"author_name":"Hamish P Gibbs","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20059535","rel_title":"Modeling projections for COVID-19 pandemic by combining epidemiological, statistical, and neural network approaches","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20059535","rel_abs":"As the number of people affected by COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 ebbs and flows in different national and sub-national regions across the world, it is evident that our lifestyle and socio-economic trajectories will have to be adapted and adjusted to the changing scenarios. Novel forecasting tools and frameworks provide an arguable advantage to facilitate this adapting and adjusting process, by promoting efficient resource management at individual and institutional levels. Based on deterministic compartment models we propose an empirical top-down modeling approach to provide epidemic forecasts and risk calculations for (local) outbreaks. We use neural networks to develop leading indicators based on available data for different regions. These indicators are not only used to assess the risk of a (new) outbreak or to determine the effectiveness of a measure at an early stage, but also in parametric models to determine an effective forecast, along with the associated uncertainty. Based on initial results, we show the performance of such an approach and its robustness against inherent disturbances in epidemiological surveillance data. We foresee such a statistical framework to drive web-based automatic platforms to democratize the dissemination of prognosis results.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steffen Uhlig","author_inst":"QuoData GmbH"},{"author_name":"Kapil Nichani","author_inst":"QuoData GmbH"},{"author_name":"Carsten Uhlig","author_inst":"Akees GmbH"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Simon","author_inst":"QuoData GmbH"},{"author_name":"Harry HX Wang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Stewart W Mercer","author_inst":"Edinburgh University"},{"author_name":"Colin Sanderson","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Martin McKee","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Christopher Troeger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kanyin I Ong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Francesco Checchi","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Pablo Perel","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sarah Joseph","author_inst":"IAVI"},{"author_name":"Hamish P Gibbs","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20067975","rel_title":"LONG-TERM CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN SURVIVORS OF CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAKS AFTER HOSPITALISATION OR ICU ADMISSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF FOLLOW-UP STUDIES","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20067975","rel_abs":"Objective: To determine the long-term clinical problems in adult survivors of coronavirus (CoV) infection [Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)] after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO were searched using the strategy: (Coronavirus OR Coronavirus Infections OR COVID OR SARS virus OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome OR MERS OR Middle east respiratory syndrome) AND (Follow-up OR Follow-up studies OR Prevalence). Original studies reporting the clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks two months after discharge or three months after admission were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive pooled estimates of prevalence and severity for different outcomes at time points up to 6 months follow-up and beyond 6 months follow-up. Results: The search yielded 1169 studies of which 28 were included in this review. There were 15 Level 1b, 8 Level 2b, 2 Level 3b and 3 Level 4 studies by OCEBM grading. Pooled analysis of studies revealed that complications commonly observed were impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [prevalence of 27.26%, 95% CI 14.87 to 44.57] and reduced exercise capacity [(6-minute walking distance (6MWD) mean 461m, 95% CI 449.66 to 472.71] at 6 months with limited improvement beyond 6 months. Coronavirus survivors had considerable prevalence of psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [38.80%, CI 30.93 to 47.31], depression [33.20%, CI 19.80 to 50.02] and anxiety [30.04%, CI 10.44 to 61.26) beyond 6 months. These complications were accompanied by low Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores at 6 months and beyond indicating reduced quality of life which is present long-term. Conclusions: The long term clinical problems in survivors of CoV infections (SARS and MERS) after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission include respiratory dysfunction, reduced exercise capacity, psychological problems such as PTSD, depression and anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Critical care, rehabilitation and mental health services should anticipate a high prevalence of these problems following COVID-19 and ensure their adequate and timely management with the aim of restoring premorbid quality of life.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hassaan Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Kajal Patel","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Darren Greenwood","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Stephen Halpin","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Penny Lewthwaite","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Abayomi Salawu","author_inst":"Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lorna Eyre","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrew Breen","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Anthony Jones","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Manoj Sivan","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Francesco Checchi","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Pablo Perel","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sarah Joseph","author_inst":"IAVI"},{"author_name":"Hamish P Gibbs","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20070367","rel_title":"Utah-Stanford Ventilator (Vent4US): Developing a rapidlyscalable ventilator for COVID-19 patients with ARDS","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20070367","rel_abs":"We describe a minimum, rapidly scalable ventilator designed for COVID-19 patients with ARDS.

Second, the infection fatality rates are projected to be substantially higher in small towns and rural areas than those in large urban areas. Third, our analysis shows that within urban regions there are also 'pockets' of high projected death rates. Overall, the areas with high and low fatality rates tend to cluster because of the high residential separation of different population age-groups in the UK.

Much of the dialogue around testing has concentrated on how countries can scale up capacity, but the uncertainty in testing has not received nearly as much attention beyond asking if a test is accurate enough to be used. Even for highly accurate tests, false positives and false negatives will accumulate as mass testing strategies are employed under pressure, and these misdiagnoses could have major implications on the ability of governments to suppress the virus. The present analysis uses a modified SIR model to understand the implication and magnitude of misdiagnosis in the context of ending lockdown measures. The results indicate that increased testing capacity alone will not provide a solution to lockdown measures. The progression of the epidemic and peak infections is shown to depend heavily on test characteristics, test targeting, and prevalence of the infection. Antibody based immunity passports are rejected as a solution to ending lockdown, as they can put the population at risk if poorly targeted. Similarly, mass screening for active viral infection may only be beneficial if it can be sufficiently well targeted, otherwise reliance on this approach for protection of the population can again put them at risk. A well targeted active viral test combined with a slow release rate is a viable strategy for continuous suppression of the virus.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas Gray","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dominic Calleja","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Alexander Wimbush","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Enrique Miralles-Dolz","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Ander Gray","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marco De-Angelis","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Elfride Derrer-Merk","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Bright Uchenna Oparaji","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Stepanov","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Louis Clearkin","author_inst":"Wirral & Liverpool University Teaching Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Scott Ferson","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Thomas Clardy","author_inst":"CKC Medical, Utah"},{"author_name":"Kai Kuck","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Manu Prakash","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20068379","rel_title":"Prioritisation of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing opportunities based on ability to achieve adequate target site concentrations derived from their established human pharmacokinetics","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20068379","rel_abs":"Many papers are emerging that describe the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. However, no comprehensive evaluation of these molecules in the context of the achievable plasma pharmacokinetics after administration of approved doses and schedules to humans has been conducted. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax\/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the analysed drugs achieved a Cmax\/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of these drugs demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax\/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax\/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date is of variable quality and conducted under different conditions by different investigators. However, this analysis has prioritised candidates with the best chance for success in therapy or chemoprevention of Covid-19 based upon the currently available in vitro activity and human plasma pharmacokinetic data. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Usman Arshad","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Henry Pertinez","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Helen Box","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Lee Tatham","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Rajith KR Rajoli","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Curley","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Megan Neary","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sharp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Neill J Liptrott","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Valentijn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher David","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

With vaccine and novel drug development in early clinical trials, repurposing of existing drugs takes the center stage. Objective: A potential drug discussed in global scientific community is hydroxychloroquine. We intend to systematically explore, analyze, rate the existing evidence of hydroxychloroquine in the light of published, unpublished and clinical trial data. Evidence review: PubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases, pre-proof article repositories, clinical trial registries were comprehensively searched with focused question of use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. The literature was systematically explored as per PRISMA guidelines. Findings: Total 156 articles were available as of 7th May 2020; of which 11 articles of relevance were analyzed. Three in-vitro studies were reviewed. Two open label non-randomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one large observational study, one follow-up study and two retrospective cohort studies were systematically analyzed and rated by oxford CEBM and GRADE framework for quality and strength of evidence. Also 27 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registries were analyzed and summarized. Hydroxychloroquine seems to be efficient in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in in-vitro cell lines. However, there is lack of strong evidence from human studies. It was found that overall quality of available evidence ranges from \"very low\" to \"low\". Conclusions and relevance: The in-vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not suffice for the use of hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID-19. Current literature shows inadequate, low level evidence in human studies. Scarcity of safety and efficacy data warrants medical communities, health care agencies and governments across the world against the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment, until robust evidence becomes available.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Umesh Devappa Suranagi","author_inst":"Lady Hardinge Medical College"},{"author_name":"Harmeet Singh Rehan","author_inst":"Lady Hardinge Medical College"},{"author_name":"Nitesh Goyal","author_inst":"Lady Hardinge Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lee Tatham","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Rajith KR Rajoli","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Curley","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Megan Neary","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sharp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Neill J Liptrott","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Valentijn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher David","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

The present study examined this hypothesis using statistical approaches based on the public data. Three approaches were utilized: 1) comparing the infection and mortality ratio of people on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, 2) comparing the number of mortalities among nations, and 3) comparing the maximum daily increase rate of total mortalities among nations. The result of 1) showed that there is no significant difference in infection per person onboard and mortality-infection between Japanese citizens vs. other nationalities and BCG obligatory nations vs. non-BCG obligatory nations on the Diamond Princess. The result of 2) showed that the number of mortalities among nations is similar to the previous studies, but this analysis also considered the timing of COVID-19 arrival in each nation. After correcting for arrival time, previously reported effect of BCG vaccination on decreasing total mortality disappeared. This is because nations that lack BCG vaccination are concentrated in Western Europe, which is near an epicenter of COVID-19. Therefore some previous reports are now considered to be affected by this artifact; the result may have been flawed by dispersal from an epicenter. However, some results showed weakly significant differences in the number of deaths at a particular time among BCG obligatory and non-BCG nations (especially the use of Japanese BCG strain Tokyo 172). However, these results are affected by the results of three countries and the effect of BCG vaccination remains inconclusive. The result of 3) showed that the maximum daily increasing rate in death among nations showed no significant difference among BCG vaccination policies. In the present study, although some results showed statistically significant differences among BCG vaccination policies, they may be affected by the impact of various other factors, such as national infection-control policies, social distancing, behavioral changes of people, possible previous local epidemics of closely related viruses, or inter-population differences in ACE2 or other genetic polymorphism. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying cause of the observed differences in infection and mortality of the disease among nations. Nevertheless, our results show that the effect of past BCG vaccination, if any, can be masked by many other factors. Therefore, the possible effect might be relatively small. In fact, in Japan, where almost all citizens have been vaccinated, COVID-19 cases are constantly increasing. Given the importance of peoples behavior in preventing viral propagation, the spread of optimism triggered by this hypothesis would be harmful to BCG vaccination nations.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Masakazu Asahara","author_inst":"Aichi Gakuin University"},{"author_name":"Valentina Socci","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Francesca Pacitti","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Di Lorenzo","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Antinisca Di Marco","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Alberto Siracusano","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Rossi","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sharp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Neill J Liptrott","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Valentijn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher David","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

Methods: We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure as applied to Switzerland as an exemplar. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol use disorder, childhood trauma due to domestic violence, changes in marital status and social isolation as these are known to increase YLL in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of movement. We stipulated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months based on current public health plans. Results: The study projects that the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be entirely borne by 2.1% of the population, who will suffer an average 9.79 YLL. Conclusions: The results presented here are likely to underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL.

Italy is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 disease, and it has registered high COVID-19 death rates and the death toll. In this article, we analyzed different Italian COVID-19 data at the regional level for the period February 24 to March 29, 2020. The analysis pipeline includes the following steps. After individuating groups of similar or dissimilar regions with respect to the ten types of available COVID-19 data using statistical test, we built several similarity matrices (reported in Supplementary file). Then, we mapped those similarity matrices into networks where nodes represent Italian regions and edges represent similarity relationships (edge length is inversely proportional to similarity). Then, network-based analysis was performed mainly discovering communities of regions that show similar behaviour. Then, network-based analysis was performed by running several community detection algorithms on those networks and by underlying communities of regions that show similar behaviour. The network-based analysis of Italian COVID-19 data is able to elegantly show how regions form communities, i.e. how they join and leave them, along time and how community consistency changes along time and with respect to the different available data.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marianna Milano","author_inst":"University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Mario Cannataro","author_inst":"University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Karen O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Haitao Cai","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Davy Weissenbacher","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Rossi","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sharp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Neill J Liptrott","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Valentijn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher David","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

To help limit the spread in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health required that all healthcare workers must be screened for symptoms daily - individuals with symptoms may not work. We rapidly created a digital COVID-19 symptom screening tool for a large, academic, integrated healthcare delivery system, Partners HealthCare, in Boston, Massachusetts. Objective: We describe the design and development of the COVID-19 symptom screening application and report on aggregate usage data from the first week of use across the organization. Methods: Using agile principles, we designed, tested and implemented a solution over the span of a week using progressively custom development approaches as the requirements and use case become more solidified. We developed the minimum viable product (MVP) of a mobile responsive, web-based self-service application using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). For employees without access to a computer or mobile device to use the self-service application, we established a manual process where in-person, socially distanced screeners asked employees entering the site if they have symptoms and then manually recorded the responses in an Office 365 Form. A custom .NET Framework application was developed solution as COVID Pass was scaled. We collected log data from the .NET application, REDCap and Office 365 from the first week of full enterprise deployment (March 30, 2020 - April 5, 2020). Aggregate descriptive statistics including overall employee attestations by day and site, employee attestations by application method (COVID Pass automatic screening vs. manual screening), employee attestations by time of day, and percentage of employees reporting COVID-19 symptoms Results: We rapidly created the MVP and gradually deployed it across the hospitals in our organization. By the end of the first week of enterprise deployment, the screening application was being used by over 25,000 employees each weekday. Over the first full week of deployment, 154,730 employee attestation logs were processed across the system. Over this 7-day period, 558 (0.36%) employees reported positive symptoms. In most clinical locations, the majority of employees (~80-90%) used the self-service application, with a smaller percentage (~10-20%) using manual attestation. Hospital staff continued to work around the clock, but as expected, staff attestations peaked during shift changes between 7-8am, 2-3pm, 4-6pm, and 11pm-midnight. Conclusions: Using rapid, agile development, we quickly created and deployed a dedicated employee attestation application that gained widespread adoption and use within our health system. Further, we have identified over 500 symptomatic employees that otherwise would have possibly come to work, potentially putting others at risk. We share the story of our implementation, lessons learned, and source code (via GitHub) for other institutions who may want to implement similar solutions.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haipeng Zhang","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dimitar Dimitrov","author_inst":"Partners Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Lynn Simpson","author_inst":"Partners Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Balaji Singh","author_inst":"Partners Information Systems"},{"author_name":"Nina Plaks","author_inst":"Partners Information Systems"},{"author_name":"Stephen Penney","author_inst":"Partners Information Systems"},{"author_name":"Jo Charles","author_inst":"Partners Enterprise Data & Digital Health"},{"author_name":"Rosemary Sheehan","author_inst":"Partners Human Resources"},{"author_name":"Steven Flammini","author_inst":"Partners Information Systems"},{"author_name":"Shawn Murphy","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Adam Landman","author_inst":"Brigham and Womens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

Cases are clustered in the city, with certain neighborhoods experiencing more cases than others. We investigate whether potential socioeconomic factors can explain between-neighborhood variation in the number of detected COVID-19 cases. Methods: Data were collected from 177 Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) in New York City (99.9% of the population). We fit multiple Bayesian Besag-York-Mollie (BYM) mixed models using positive COVID-19 tests as the outcome and a set of 10 representative economic, demographic, and health-care associated ZCTA-level parameters as potential predictors. The BYM model includes both spatial and nonspatial random effects to account for clustering and overdispersion. Results: Multiple different regression approaches indicated a consistent, statistically significant association between detected COVID-19 cases and dependent (under 18 or 65+ years old) population, male to female ratio, and median household income. In the final model, we found that an increase of only 1% in dependent population is associated with a 2.5% increase in detected COVID-19 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6% to 3.4%, p < 0.0005). An increase of 1 male per 100 females is associated with a 1.0% (95% CI: 0.6% to 1.5%, p < 0.0005) increases in detected cases. A decrease of $10,000 median household income is associated with a 2.5% (95% CI: 1.0% to 4.1% p = 0.002) increase in detected COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our findings indicate associations between neighborhoods with a large dependent population, those with a high proportion of males, and low-income neighborhoods and detected COVID-19 cases. Given the elevated mortality in aging populations, the study highlights the importance of public health management during and after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Further work is warranted to fully understand the mechanisms by which these factors may have affected the number of detected cases, either in terms of the true number of cases or access to testing.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Stuart Whittle","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Ana Diaz-Artiles","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Jack Lahey","author_inst":"Skid Row Housing Trust"},{"author_name":"Isha Berry","author_inst":"Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Joanna Pineda","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto; Ontario Institute for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Vinyas Harish","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Andrew T Lam","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Seung Eun Yi","author_inst":"Layer 6 AI"},{"author_name":"Sophie Hu","author_inst":"Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Canadian Open Data Working Group: Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fine","author_inst":"Institute for Better Health, Trillium Health Partners; Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

While vaccination remains the cornerstone of influenza prevention, common measures practiced during the COVID-19 pandemic such as social distancing, the use of protective face masks, and frequent hand washing are rarely utilized during flu season. In this investigation, we examined the effect of these preventative measures in decreasing influenza burden this year. We examined three countries with major COVID-19 outbreaks i.e. China, Italy and the United States, and compared the flu activity this year to the average of the last 4 years (2015-2019). We found that this year in China and Italy, there was a significantly steeper decline of flu cases than average, which correlated with an increase in positive COVID-19 case reports in those countries. These \"averted\" cases can be translated into a substantial decrease in morbidity and mortality. As such, we conclude that the current COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder that behavioral measures can decrease the burden of communicable respiratory infections, and these measures should be adopted to an extent during normal influenza season.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Grant M Young","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Peng","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Andre Rebaza","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Santos Bermejo","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"De Chang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Lokesh Sharma","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Seung Eun Yi","author_inst":"Layer 6 AI"},{"author_name":"Sophie Hu","author_inst":"Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Canadian Open Data Working Group: Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fine","author_inst":"Institute for Better Health, Trillium Health Partners; Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

Two particle counters concurrently sample ambient air and air inside the masks; mask performance is evaluated by mean particle removal efficiency and statistical variability when worn as designed and with a nylon overlayer, to independently assess fit and material. Worn as designed both commercial surgical masks and cloth masks had widely varying effectiveness (53-75% and 28-90% filtration efficiency, respectively). Most surgical-style masks improved with the nylon overlayer, indicating poor fit. This rapid testing method uses widely available hardware, requires only a few calculations from collected data, and provides both a holistic and aspect-wise evaluation of mask performance.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amy V Mueller","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Matthew J.

Among the standard models for COVID-19 global pandemic prediction, simple epidemiological and statistical models have received more attention by authorities, and they are popular in the media. Due to a high level of uncertainty and lack of essential data, standard models have shown low accuracy for long-term prediction. Although the literature includes several attempts to address this issue, the essential generalization and robustness abilities of existing models needs to be improved. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine learning and soft computing models to predict the COVID-19 outbreak. Among a wide range of machine learning models investigated, two models showed promising results (i.e., multi-layered perceptron, MLP, and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, ANFIS). Based on the results reported here, and due to the highly complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sina F.

It is therefore urgent to estimate the impact such measures are having. We introduce a Bayesian epidemiological model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and able to participate in distancing measures, with the timing of these measures informed by survey data on attitudes to distancing and COVID-19.We fit our model to reported COVID-19 cases in British Columbia, Canada, using an observation model that accounts for both underestimation and the delay between symptom onset and reporting. We estimate the impact that physical distancing (also known as social distancing)has had on the contact rate and examine the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We find that distancing has had a strong impact, consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers. We estimate that approximately 0.78 (0.66-0.89 90% CI) of contacts have been removed for individuals in British Columbia practising physical distancing and that this fraction is above the threshold of 0.45 at which prevalence is expected to grow. However, relaxing distancing measures beyond this threshold re-starts rapid exponential growth. Because the extent of underestimation is unknown, the data are consistent with a wide range in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population; changes to testing criteria over time introduce additional uncertainty. Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures - if sufficiently strong and robustly followed - could control COVID-19 transmission, but that if distancing measures are relaxed too much, the epidemic curve would grow to high prevalence.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean C Anderson","author_inst":"Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Nanaimo, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Edwards","author_inst":"Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Nanaimo, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Madi Yerlanov","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Nicola Mulberry","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Jessica Stockdale","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Sarafa A Iyaniwura","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Rebeca C Falcao","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Michael C.

We analysed an outbreak involving three non-associated families in Restaurant X in Guangzhou, China, and assessed the possibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and characterize the associated environmental conditions. Methods: We collected epidemiological data, obtained a video record and a patron seating-arrangement from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the suspected index patient. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer decay method. Results: Three families (A, B, C), 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at this time, or previously, ate lunch at Restaurant X on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 24, 2020) at three neighboring tables. Subsequently, three members of family B and two members of family C became infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas none of the waiters or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the ventilation rate was 0.75-1.04 L\/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was observed, aside from back-to-back sitting by some patrons. Our results show that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Conclusions: Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to poor ventilation may explain the community spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Jian Hang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xuguang Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ling Hong","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Peng Liang","author_inst":"Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jiansen Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shenglan Xiao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jianjian Wei","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Li Liu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Min Kang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

The primary aim of this review was to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. Methods A systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for faecal virus. Search terms for Medline included \"clinical\", \"faeces\", \"gastrointestinal secretions\", \"stool\", \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", and \"2019-nCoV\". Additional searches were done in AJG, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The WHO Database, CEBM, NEJM, social media and the NICE, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints. Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus. Results There were 26 relevant articles identified. Combining study results demonstrated that 53.9% of those tested for faecal RNA were positive. Duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47 days after onset of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus. Conclusion There is a high rate of positive PCR tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sunnia Gupta","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Jody Parker","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Smits","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Underwood","author_inst":"Cardiff University and Cardiff and Vale Health Board"},{"author_name":"Sunil Dolwani","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Peng Liang","author_inst":"Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jiansen Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shenglan Xiao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jianjian Wei","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Li Liu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Min Kang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.
