In this study, we aimed to explore the elements that may reduce the negative effects on mental health of the quarantine period imposed by most governments during this worldwide crisis. We conducted an online survey to evaluate demographic, lifestyle and mental health variables in the Portuguese population. We observed that factors related with living conditions, maintaining the work either online or in the workplace, frequency of exercise and absence of a previous psychological or physic disorders are protective features of psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, stress and obsessive-compulsive symptoms). Finally, the individuals previously receiving psychotherapeutic support exhibited better psychological indicators if they did not interrupt the process as a consequence of the outbreak. Our results indicate that the practice of physical exercise, reduced consumption of COVID-19 information and the implementation of remote mental healthcare measures might prevent larger impacts on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro Silva Moreira","author_inst":"Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine - University of Minho.

Given the global demand for fast and reliable diagnosis to determine the carrier individuals, a stock-out scenario for a number of essential reagents\/kits used along the diagnostic process has been foreseen by many organizations. Having identified the RNA extraction step as one of the key bottlenecks, we tested several alternatives that avoid the use of commercial kits for this step. The analysis showed that 2-propanol precipitation of the viral RNA, followed by one-step RT-qPCR results in a sensitivity and specificity comparable to that provided currently by automatized systems such as the COBAS 6800 system. Therefore, this simple protocol allows SARS-CoV-2 testing independently of commercial kit providers in a time and cost-effective manner. It can be readily implemented in research and\/or diagnostic laboratories worldwide, provided that patient confidentiality and researcher safety are ensured. Scaling up the testing capabilities of hospitals and research facilities will identify larger numbers of infected individuals to paint a clear picture of the COVID-19 prevalence, a pre-requisite for informed policy decision making.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xabier Guruceaga","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Amanda Sierra","author_inst":"Achucarro Basque Center for Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Daniel Marino","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Izortze Santin","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Jon Ander Nieto-Garai","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Jose Ramon Bilbao","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Maier Lorizate","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Patricia Aspichueta","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country EHU\/UPV"},{"author_name":"coBIG (COVID19 Basque Inter-institutional Group)","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Ugo Mayor","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country EHU\/UPV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20080846","rel_title":"Spatial-temporal variations of atmospheric factors contribute to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20080846","rel_abs":"The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reached over two million confirmed cases worldwide, and numbers are still growing at a fast rate. The majority of new infections are now being reported outside of China, where the outbreak officially originated in December 2019 in Wuhan. Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries\/regions. In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future. While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stem from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown. Here we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies. We propose that air pollutants, and specifically particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and ozone, are oppositely related with the SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency and could serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raffaele Fronza","author_inst":"Genewerk GmbH, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marina Lusic","author_inst":"Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany; German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Manfred Schmidt","author_inst":"Genewerk GmbH, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bojana Lucic","author_inst":"Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany;  German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jon Ander Nieto-Garai","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Jose Ramon Bilbao","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Maier Lorizate","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Patricia Aspichueta","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country EHU\/UPV"},{"author_name":"coBIG (COVID19 Basque Inter-institutional Group)","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Ugo Mayor","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country EHU\/UPV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20080796","rel_title":"COVID-19 severe pneumonia in Mexico City - First experience in a Mexican hospital","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20080796","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic since its first confirmed case, has changed the world. The need for accurate and truthful information is vital. Mexico and Latin America have been widely affected, so having local epidemiological data, will be of great clinical utility. Methods: A total of 33 hospitalized patients with Covid-19 pneumonia (either severe or critical) were identified from electronic health record in a third level care private hospital in Mexico City from March 13rd to April 13rd, 2020. We conducted a descriptive study of patients for characterization of the clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings, as well as complications. Results: The mean age was 60.6 (12.68) years and 23 (69.7%) were males. Twenty-three patients (69.6%) were overweight or obese. The median duration of symptoms before admission was 7 days. All the patients required mechanical invasive ventilation. The median duration of the mechanical ventilation was 12(2.6) days and all patients were extubated except one. All patients were started on antiviral treatment in the first 24 hours after admission once the diagnosis of Covid19 pneumonia was made. There was no difference between the treatment option and the length of stay. The extubation rate was higher (91.6%) than in other series, with no fatalities even though they were treated with different regimens. Conclusions: This one-centre experience describes the epidemiology, treatment and outcome of 33 patients with severe or critical COVID pneumonia admitted to the ICU. Most patients in our series were overweight or obese male, which we observed were of higher risk to present critical pneumonia, as well as high levels of Interleukin-6. The foregoing is relevant, due to the high incidence of these comorbidities in our country.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Valente-Acosta","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Irma Hoyo-Ulloa","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Luis Espinosa-Aguilar","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Raquel Mendoza-Aguilar","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Javier Garcia-Guerrero","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Diego Ontanon-Zurita","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brenda Gomez-Gomez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Omar Fueyo-Rodriguez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Juan Mauricio Vera-Zertuche","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rodolfo Anzola-Arias","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jose Victor Jimenez-Ceja","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Horta-Capinteyro","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Claudia Olvera-Guzman","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Janet Aguirre-Sanchez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Juvenal Franco-Granillo","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Laura Jauregui-Camargo","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Sada-Diaz","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rafael Saavedra-Perez-Salas","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andres Palomar-Lever","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Francisco Moreno-Sanchez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20076422","rel_title":"Pooled testing with replication: a mass testing strategy for the COVID-19 pandemics","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20076422","rel_abs":"In absence of a vaccine or antiviral drugs for the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes urgent to test for positiveness to the virus as many people as possible, in order to detect early outbreaks of the infection. Present testing solutions are based on the extraction of RNA from patients using oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, and then testing with real-time PCR for the presence of specific RNA filaments identifying the virus. This approach is limited by the availability of reactants, trained technicians and laboratories. To speed up the testing procedures, some attempts have been done on group testing, which means that the swabs of multiple patients are grouped together and tested. Here we propose to use this technique in conjunction with a combinatorial replication scheme in which each patient is allocated in two or more groups to reduce total numbers of tests and to allow testing of even larger numbers of people.

However, evidence from external quality assessments and real-world data indicate enough a high enough false positive rate to make positive results highly unreliable over a broad range of scenarios. This has clinical and case management implications, and affects an array of epidemiological statistics, including the asymptomatic ratio, prevalence, and hospitalization and death rates, as well as epidemiologic models.

We hypothesised that if patients treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or AT1 receptor blockers (ARB) were more prone to SARS-CoV2 infection and had a worse prognosis than untreated patients, the prevalence of consumption of these drugs would be higher in patients with COVID-19 compared to the general population. Methods and results: We used a clinical epidemiology approach based on the estimation of standardised prevalence ratio (SPR) of consumption of ACEI and ARB in four groups of patients (including 187 COVID-19 positive) with increasing severity referred to the University hospital of Lille and in three French reference samples (the exhaustive North population (n=1,569,968), a representative sample of the French population (n=414,046), a random sample of Lille area (n=1,584)). The SPRs of ACEI and ARB did not differ as the severity of the COVID-19 patients increased, being similar to the regular consumption of these drugs in the North of France population with the same non-significant increase for both treatment (1.17 [0.83-1.67]). A statistically significant increase in the SPR of ARB (1.56 [1.02-2.39]) was observed in intensive care unit patients only. After stratification on obesity, this increase was limited to the high risk subgroup of obese patients. Conclusions: Our results strongly support the recommendation that ACEI and ARB should be continued in the population and in COVID-19 positive patients, reinforcing the position of several scientific societies.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luc Dauchet","author_inst":"Univ Lille, Inserm, CHU de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging Related Diseases and CHU Lille Depart"},{"author_name":"Marc Lambert","author_inst":"Univ Lille, Inserm, CHU de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging Related Diseases and CHU Lille Intern"},{"author_name":"Victoria Gauthier","author_inst":"Univ Lille, Inserm, CHU de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging Related Diseases"},{"author_name":"Julien Poissy","author_inst":"CHU Lille Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Karine Faure","author_inst":"CHU Lille Department of Infectious Diseases and Univ Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, U1019-UMR9017-CIIL-Centre d'Infection et d'Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Facon","author_inst":"CHU Lille SAMU59 and Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9cile Yelnik","author_inst":"CHU Lille Internal Medicine Department"},{"author_name":"Sophie Panaget","author_inst":"CHU Lille Department of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Thierry Plagnieux","author_inst":"DRSM Hauts de France, F-59009 Villeneuve d'Ascq"},{"author_name":"Florent Verfaillie","author_inst":"DRSM Hauts de France, F-59009 Villeneuve d'Ascq"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mathieu","author_inst":"CHU Lille Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Patrick Goldstein","author_inst":"CHU Lille SAMU59 and Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"Aline Meirhaeghe","author_inst":"Univ Lille, Inserm, CHU de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging Related Diseases"},{"author_name":"Philippe Amouyel","author_inst":"Univ Lille, Inserm, CHU de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Ageing Related Diseases and CHU Lille Depar"},{"author_name":"Juvenal Franco-Granillo","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Laura Jauregui-Camargo","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Sada-Diaz","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rafael Saavedra-Perez-Salas","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andres Palomar-Lever","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Francisco Moreno-Sanchez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.072652","rel_title":"Molecular Architecture of Early Dissemination and Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus in Metropolitan Houston, Texas","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.072652","rel_abs":"We sequenced the genomes of 320 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in metropolitan Houston, Texas, an ethnically diverse region with seven million residents. These genomes were from the viruses causing infections in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic affecting Houston. Substantial viral genomic diversity was identified, which we interpret to mean that the virus was introduced into Houston many times independently by individuals who had traveled from different parts of the country and the world. The majority of viruses are apparent progeny of strains derived from Europe and Asia. We found no significant evidence of more virulent viral types, stressing the linkage between severe disease, underlying medical conditions, and perhaps host genetics. We discovered a signal of selection acting on the spike protein, the primary target of massive vaccine efforts worldwide.

However, without reaching herd immunity, the return of epidemic is possible. We investigate the impact of population structure, case importation, asymptomatic cases, and the number of contacts on a possible second wave of epidemic through mathematical modelling. Methods: we built a modified Susceptible-exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model with parameters mirroring those of the COVID-19 pandemic and reported simulated characteristics of epidemics for incidence, hospitalizations and deaths under different scenarios. Results: A larger percent of old people leads to higher number of hospitalizations, while a large percent of prior infection will effectively curb the epidemic. The number of imported cases and the speed of importation have small impact on the epidemic progression. However, a higher percent of asymptomatic cases slows the epidemic down and reduces the number of hospitalizations and deaths at the epidemic peak. Finally, reducing the number of contacts among young people alone has moderate effects on themselves, but little effects on the old population. However, reducing the number of contacts among old people alone can mitigate the epidemic significantly in both groups, even though young people remain active within themselves. Conclusion: Reducing the number of contacts among high risk populations alone can mitigate the burden of epidemic in the whole society. Interventions targeting high risk groups may be more effective in containing or mitigating the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinhua Yu","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"Randall J.

We have developed a fundamental spreading model for the COVID-19 epidemic that has two parameters: the community transmission rate and a metric describing the degree of isolation and social distancing in a given community or region (country, state, county, or city). These two parameters are calibrated to data from the community, so the model uncertainty depends on the quality of the data and ability to test for COVID-19. The model shows that social distancing significantly reduces the epidemic spread and flattens the curve. The model predicts well the spreading trajectory and peak time of new infections for a community of any size and provides an upper estimate for the total number of infections and daily new infection rate for weeks into the future, providing the vital information and lead time needed to prepare for and mitigate the epidemic. The theory has immediate and far-reaching applications for ongoing outbreaks or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baolian Cheng","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ming Wang","author_inst":"Retired from Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Paul A.

Our approach enables compositionality, where either the plant or the controller could be replaced by an alternative model. Our work is inspired by the engineering approach for the design of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Consequently, we term the new framework Compositional Cyber-Physical Epidemiology (CCPE). We created different classes of controllers and applied these to control the disease in New Zealand and Italy. Our controllers closely follow government decisions based on their published data.

Using Twitter data, we aim to (1) define and quantify the prevalence and evolution of facets of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US in a spatiotemporal context and (2) examine the most amplified tweets among social distancing facets. We analyzed a total of 259,529 unique tweets containing \"coronavirus\" from 115,485 unique users between January 23, 2020 and March 24, 2020 that were identified by the Twitter API as English and U.S.-based. Tweets containing specified keywords (determined a priori) were grouped into six social distancing facets: implementation, purpose, social disruption, adaptation, positive emotions, and negative emotions. Tweets about social disruptiveness were most retweeted, and implementation tweets were most favorited. Social distancing tweets became overall more prevalent in the U.S. from late January to March but were not geographically uniform. In January and February, facets of social distancing appeared in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, which were among the first cities impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Tweets related to the \"implementation\" and \"negative emotions\" facets of social distancing largely dominated in combination with topics of \"social disruption\" and \"adaptation\", albeit to a lesser degree. Social distancing can be defined in terms of facets that respond and represent certain moments and events in a pandemic, including travel restrictions and rising COVID-19 case counts. For example, in February, Miami, FL had a low volume of social distancing tweets but grew in March which corresponded with the rise of COVID-19 cases in the city. This suggests that overall volume of social distancing tweets can reflect the relative case count in respective locations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiye Kwon","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Connor Grady","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Josemari T.

Due to the unknown nature of the disease and the lack of specific drugs, several potential treatments were used for patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate studies of the effects of Favipiravir in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods and analysis We will search electronic databases including LitCovid hub, PubMed, Scopus, ISI web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Embase using keywords related to COVID-19 and Favipiravir. We will search the reference lists of all included studies and reviews. We will also search for clinical trial registries, such as clinicaltrial.gov for the ongoing clinical trials. Two investigators (MAZ and SH) will independently screen titles, abstracts, and full-text of included studies based on eligibility criteria. These investigators will also independently extract data and appraise the quality of studies. All potential discrepancies will be resolved through consultation with the third reviewer. Data synthesis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.3) or CMA (version 2). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard I2 test. A funnel plot, Egger test, and Begg test will be used for asymmetry to explore possible publication bias. Ethics and dissemination The findings of this systematic review with proportional meta-analysis will help to identify the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir for COVID-19 patients. Knowledge gained from this research will also assist physicians in selecting better treatment options and developing a guideline in this field.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Morteza Arab-Zozani","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Hassanipour","author_inst":"Guilan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"DJavad GHoddoosi-Nejad","author_inst":"birjand university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Samah J.

The current study aims to evaluate how mitigating interventions affected the epidemic process in the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the US and whether temperature played a role in the epidemic process. Methods: Publicly available data for the time series of COVID-19 cases and deaths and weather were analyzed at the metropolitan level. The time-varying reproductive numbers (Rt) based on retrospective moving average were used to explore the trends. Student t tests were used to compare temperature and peak Rt cross-sectionally. Results: We found that virus transmissibility, measured by instantaneous reproduction number (Rt), had declined since the end of March for all areas and almost all of them reached a Rt of 1 or below after April 15, 2020. However, the Rts remained around 1 for most areas since then and some small and short rebounds were presented in some areas, suggesting a persistent epidemic in those areas. The timing of the main decline was concurrent with the implementation of mitigating interventions. Cities with warm temperature also tended to have a lower peak Rt than that of cities with cold temperature. However, large geographic variations existed. Conclusions: Aggressive interventions might have mitigated the current epidemic of COVID-19, while temperature might have some weak effects on the virus transmission.

Targeting the nucleoprotein N of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in order to inhibit its association with viral RNA could be a strategy to impeding viral replication and possibly other essential functions associated with viral N. The antiviral properties of naproxen, belonging to the NSAID family, previously demonstrated against Influenza A virus, were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2.

Calculations are performed across the physiological pH range to also examine the impact of pH on these interactions. Two of six spike protein s1 variations having greater electric forces at pH levels consistent with nasal secretions and significant variations in force across all five variants of ACE2. Five out of six spike protein s1 variations have relatively consistent forces at pH levels of the lung, and one spike protein s1 variant that has low potential across a wide range of pH. These predictions indicate that variants of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and human ACE2 in certain combinations could potentially play a role in increased binding efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Scott P Morton","author_inst":"Middle Tennessee State University"},{"author_name":"Joshua L Phillips","author_inst":"Middle Tennessee State University"},{"author_name":"Mario-Andres Pizzorno","author_inst":"Lyon I University, CIRI, INSERM 1111, CNRS UMR 5308, Ens de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Julien Henri","author_inst":"Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique CNRS UMR 8226"},{"author_name":"Francis Berenbaum","author_inst":"Sorbonne University, INSERM, CRSA UMR S_938, AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Lyon I University, CIRI, INSERM U 1111, CNRS UMR 5308, Ens de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Bruno Feve","author_inst":"INSERM and Sorbonne Universitu CRSA UMR S_938, AP-HP, ICAN"},{"author_name":"Frederic Adnet","author_inst":"AP-HP, SAMU, Avicenne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michele Sabbah","author_inst":"INSERM and Sorbonne University, CRSA UMR S_938"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rosa-Calavatra","author_inst":"University Lyon I, CIRI, INSERM U1111, CNRS UMR 5308, Ens de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Vincent Marechal","author_inst":"INSERM and Sorbonne University, CRSA UMR S_938"},{"author_name":"Anny Slama-Schwok","author_inst":"INSERM  and Sorbonne University, CRSA UMR S_938"},{"author_name":"Heather Hendrickson","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ghazaleh Eskandari","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Muthiah Kumaraswami","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jason S.

Western blot validation of the downstream effector molecules of these pathways revealed a significant reduction in activated S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at 72 hours post infection.

It is therefore important and timely to characterize interactions between the virus and host cell at the molecular level to understand its disease pathogenesis. To gain insights, we performed high-throughput sequencing that generated time-series data simultaneously for bioinformatics analysis of virus genomes and host transcriptomes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our analysis results showed that the rapid growth of the virus was accompanied by an early intensive response of host genes. We also systematically compared the molecular footprints of the host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 induced hundreds of up-regulated host genes hallmarked by a significant cytokine production followed by virus-specific host antiviral responses. While the cytokine and antiviral responses triggered by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were only observed during the late stage of infection, the host antiviral responses during the SARS-CoV-2 infection were gradually enhanced lagging behind the production of cytokine. The early rapid host responses were potentially attributed to the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, underscored by evidence of a remarkably up-regulated gene expression of TPRMSS2 soon after infection. Taken together, our findings provide novel molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiya Sun","author_inst":"Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College; Suzhou Institute of System"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Virology, National Health and Family Planning Commission, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Aiping Wu","author_inst":"Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ren Yang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Virology, National Health and Family Planning Commission, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Mei Pan","author_inst":"Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College; Suzhou Institute of System"},{"author_name":"Jie Sheng","author_inst":"Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College; Suzhou Institute of System"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College; Suzhou Institute of System"},{"author_name":"Longfei Mao","author_inst":"Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College; Suzhou Institute of System"},{"author_name":"Ming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Beijing TongRen Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Baoying Huang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Virology, National Health and Family Planning Commission, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Virology, National Health and Family Planning Commission, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ali Mirazimi","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ujjwal Neogi","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Muthiah Kumaraswami","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jason S.

The type I\/III IFN responses are antiviral but partially proviral in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Poor induction and response to innate immunity may contribute to destitute neutralization index of the antibody produced, and indeed we found that the patient serum could not efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virions.

To enter host cells, the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to its receptor, ACE2, and is then processed by TMPRSS2. Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species, relative to human ACE2, and correlated these changes with COVID-19 infection data. We also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity. We predict that mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but few fish, birds or reptiles. Susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus, necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Su Datt Lam","author_inst":"Department of Applied Physics, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, 43600, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Bordin","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vaishali P Waman","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Harry M Scholes","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Ashford","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Neeladri Sen","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, 411008, India"},{"author_name":"Lucy van Dorp","author_inst":"UCL Genetics Institute"},{"author_name":"Clemens Rauer","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Natalie L Dawson","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Camilla SM Pang","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Mahnaz Abbasian","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian Sillitoe","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah JL Edwards","author_inst":"Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Jonathan G Lees","author_inst":"Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, OX3 OBP, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne M Santini","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Christine A Orengo","author_inst":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Rafael Saavedra-Perez-Salas","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andres Palomar-Lever","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Francisco Moreno-Sanchez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.067769","rel_title":"Heat inactivation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.067769","rel_abs":"Supernatants of cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, nasopharyngeal and sera samples containing SARS-CoV-2 were submitted to heat inactivation for various periods of time, ranging from 30 seconds to 60 minutes.

The long, complex orf1ab polyproteins of SARS-COV2 play an important role in viral RNA synthesis. To assess the impact of mutations in this important domain, we analyzed 1134 complete protein sequences of orf1ab polyprotein from NCBI Virus database from affected patients across various states of USA from December 2019 to 25th April, 2020. Multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega followed by statistical significance was calculated. Four significant mutations T265I (nsp 2), P4715L (nsp 12) and P5828L and Y5865C (both at nsp 13) were identified in important non-structural proteins, which function either as replicase or helicase. A comparative analysis shows 265T>I, 5828P>L and 5865Y>C are unique to USA and not reported from Europe or Asia; while one, 4715P>L is predominant in both Europe and USA. Mutational changes in amino acids are predicted to alter structure and function of corresponding proteins, thereby it is imperative to consider the mutational spectra while designing new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral orf1ab.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuvam Banerjee","author_inst":"University of Calcutta"},{"author_name":"Sohan Seal","author_inst":"Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, Belur Math, Howrah"},{"author_name":"Riju Dey","author_inst":"Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, Belur Math, Howrah"},{"author_name":"Kousik kr.

A thorough understanding beyond just sequential similarities among the protein coding genes of SARS-CoV2 is important in order to differentiate or relate to the other known CoVs of the same genus. In this study, we compare three genomes namely MT012098 (India-Kerala), MT050493 (India-Kerala), MT358637 (India-Gujrat) from India with NC_045512 (China-Wuhan) to view the spatial as well as molecular arrangements of nucleotide bases of all the genes embedded in these four genomes. Based on different features extracted for each gene embedded in these genomes, corresponding phylogenetic relationships have been built up. Differences in phylogenetic tree arrangement with individual gene suggest that three genomes of Indian origin have come from three different origins or the evolution of viral genome is very fast process. This study would also help to understand the virulence factors, disease pathogenicity, origin and transmission of the SARS-CoV2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sk.
