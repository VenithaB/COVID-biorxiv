Design: A pilot randomized controlled trial. Setting Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China Patients: A total of 42 adults with severe COVID-19. Interventions: Participants in the CHM plus standard care group received CHM and standard care, and the control group received standard care alone. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment at 7 days. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]; 21 [50%] were aged [&ge;] 65 years; and 35 [83%] women, 42 (100%) had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift towards death was lower in the CHM plus group than the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148 to 2.352 P=.454). Three (2 from the CHM plus group and 1 from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 18% (5) vs 14% (2), 71% (20) vs 64% (9), and 0% (0) vs 7% (1) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone. Conclusions: For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. CHM effects in COVID-19 may be clinically important and warrant further consideration and studies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yong-an Ye","author_inst":"Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"G-CHAMPS collaborative group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Yian Kim Tan","author_inst":"DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Sean Wei Xiang Ong","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Marcus Gum","author_inst":"DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Sok Kiang Lau","author_inst":"DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Sutjipto","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Pei Hua Lee","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Than The Son","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Barnaby E.

As of 27 March 2020, there were more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths worldwide. In those places with a rapid growth in numbers of sick people in need of hospitalization and intensive care, this demand has over-saturate the medical facilities and, in turn, rise the mortality rate. In the absence of a vaccine, classical epidemiological measures such as testing, quarantine and physical distancing are ways to reduce the growing speed of new infections. Thus, these measures should be a priority for all governments in order to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated to this disease. System dynamics is widely used in many fields of the biological sciences to study and explain changing systems. The system dynamics approach can help us understand the rapid spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 and also generate scenarios to test the effect of different control measures. The aim of this study is to provide an open model (using STELLA(R) from Iseesystems) that can be customized to any area\/region and by any user, allowing them to evaluate the different behavior of the COVID-19 dynamics under different scenarios. Thus, our intention is not to generate a model to accurately predict the evolution of the disease nor to supplant others more robust -official and non-official- from governments and renowned institutions. We believe that scenarios comparison can be an effective tool to convince the society of the need of a colossal and unprecedented effort to reduce new infections and ultimately, fatalities.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"CESAR BORDEHORE","author_inst":"Universidad de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Miriam Navarro","author_inst":"University of Alicante"},{"author_name":"Zaida Herrador","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Ministry of Health, Spain"},{"author_name":"Eva S.

The binding affinities were compared with other compounds and drugs already identified as potential ligands for 6lu7 and 6vsb as well as Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The docked compounds with best binding affinities were also filtered for drug likeness using the SwissADME and PROTOX platforms on the basis of Physicochemical properties and toxicity respectively. The docking results revealed that scopodulcic acid and dammarenolic acid had the best binding affinity on the s-glycoprotein and Mpro protein targets respectively.

We predicted the binding affinity between 9-mer and 15-mer peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome for 9,360 class I and 8,445 class II HLA alleles, respectively. We identified 368,145 unique combinations of peptide-HLA complexes (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity less than 500nM, and observed significant overlap between class I and II predicted pMHCs. Using simulated populations derived from worldwide HLA frequency data, we identified sets of epitopes predicted in at least 90% of the population in 57 countries. We also developed a method to prioritize pMHCs for specific populations. Collectively, this public dataset and accessible user interface (Shiny app: https:\/\/rstudio-connect.parkerici.org\/content\/13\/) can be used to explore the SARS-CoV-2 epitope landscape in the context of diverse HLA types across global populations.Competing Interest StatementK.M.C is a shareholder in Geneoscopy LLC.

The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain and USA among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product. Thus, this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neha Jain","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Indore"},{"author_name":"Uma Shankar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Indore"},{"author_name":"Prativa Majee","author_inst":"Indian Insitute of Technology, Indore"},{"author_name":"Amit Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Indore"},{"author_name":"Anusha Kalbasi","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Arinze Umera","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Uzal Umar","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Simeon Omale","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Nnadi","author_inst":"Plateau State University, Bokkos"},{"author_name":"John Chinyere Aguiyi","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Donald K.

The NCOVID-19 virus is spread among individuals through close communication in the form of droplets, not via airborne. Those individuals are at risk of infection who are in close contact with a NCOVID-19 patient or who take care of NCOVID-19 patients. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of any infection in healthcare facilities. Therefore, healthcare workers should be aware of basic knowledge and all procedures concerning prevention and protection from NCOVID-19. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the awareness level of healthcare workers toward NCOVID-2019 in Pakistan. Material and Methods A questionnaire was generated according to WHO information that was circulated among the healthcare workers of different hospitals and medical institutes of Pakistan. Calculated sample size was 650. Conclusion Healthcare workers have insufficient knowledge of preventive measures and infection control.

As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing policies. These delays are likely to produce significant, on-going harm to public health.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Adolph","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kenya Amano","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Bree Bang-Jensen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Nancy Fullman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"John Wilkerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Arinze Umera","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Uzal Umar","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Simeon Omale","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Nnadi","author_inst":"Plateau State University, Bokkos"},{"author_name":"John Chinyere Aguiyi","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Donald K.

Like other respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, the virus remains only about two months in any given population, yet the peak incidence and the lethality can vary. The data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, and Italy were hit by the more dangerous \"SKII\" variant. While the epidemic in China is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the course of the epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing and the peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the US first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies. While containment merely prolongs the time the disease circulates until the proportion of immune people is high enough for \"herd immunity\", reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Knut M.

As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus. | Methods: We adopted the Huike database to extract news articles about coronavirus from major press media, between January 1st, 2020, to February 20th, 2020. The data were sorted and analyzed by Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number using the coherence number. We operated Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling with the suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into two-dimensional plane via multidimensional scaling. | Findings: After removing duplicates, 7791 relevant news reports were identified. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as our number of topics and obtained their names and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, global\/local social\/economic influences, accounting for 32.6%, 16.6%, 11.8% of the collected reports respectively. | Interpretation: The Chinese mass media news reports lag behind the COVID-19 outbreak development. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a global issue, and society has also become concerned about donation and support as well as mental health. We recommend that future work should address the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qian Liu","author_inst":"School of Journalism and Communication, National Media Experimental Teaching Demonstration Center, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Communicati"},{"author_name":"Zequan Zheng","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China; Faculty of Medicine, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jiabin Zheng","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China; Faculty of Medicine, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Qiuyi Chen","author_inst":"School of Journalism and Communication, National Media Experimental Teaching Demonstration Center, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guan Liu","author_inst":"Faculty of Computer Centre, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Sihan Chen","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Bojia Chu","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Hongyu Zhu","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Babatunde Akinwunmi","author_inst":"Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, Massachuset"},{"author_name":"Jian Huang","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, St Mary's Campus, Imperial College London, Norfolk"},{"author_name":"Casper J.

Objectives: Assessing the spread of the COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and precipitation. Methods: Open-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25{degrees} latitude\/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios. Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single case in 113\/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from -28.0 to 30.1 {degrees}C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4 to 23.0 {degrees}C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm-2 and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence. Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Byass","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Zequan Zheng","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China; Faculty of Medicine, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jiabin Zheng","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China; Faculty of Medicine, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Qiuyi Chen","author_inst":"School of Journalism and Communication, National Media Experimental Teaching Demonstration Center, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guan Liu","author_inst":"Faculty of Computer Centre, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Sihan Chen","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Bojia Chu","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Hongyu Zhu","author_inst":"International School, Jinan University, China"},{"author_name":"Babatunde Akinwunmi","author_inst":"Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, Massachuset"},{"author_name":"Jian Huang","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, St Mary's Campus, Imperial College London, Norfolk"},{"author_name":"Casper J.

Further, there remain countries in the early phase of outbreak with zero or limited number of cases in southern hemisphere countries. In those countries at risk of future outbreak, ascertaining whether cases are imported or the result of local secondary transmission is important for government to shape appropriate public health strategies. Objective: To develop a method to estimate timing of infection establishment, which helps differentiate imported and autochthonous cases. Design, Setting and Participants: Of the first 18 cases reported in Singapore, 12 were used in our study (1 case with insufficient data and 5 on anti-viral treatment were excluded from the analysis). The viral load data from these initial cases considered imported due to their travel history to Wuhan were analyzed. Another viral load data from 3 cases reported from Zhuhai, China, for whom exposed day were known, were also analyzed to determine the viral load threshold for infection establishment. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test. Main Outcomes and Measures: The timing of infection establishment of each case was assessed by analysing viral load data after symptom onset using a within-host viral dynamics model for SARS-CoV-2. Estimated timing of infection will indicate whether cases are imported or autochthonous transmission within Singapore. Results: Six among the 12 cases were clearly imported cases, whereas we could not rule out the possibility of secondary transmission for the rest of 6 cases, which collectively evidenced ongoing transmission in Singapore. For the 6 cases who could be the results of secondary transmission, further investigation to identify the source of infection within Singapore should be warranted (i.e., contact tracing). Conclusions and Relevance: In an early phase of outbreak due to entrance or re-entrance of the virus to countries\/communities, collecting viral load data over time from cases from symptom onset is highly recommended, because viral load data are valuable to infer the timing of infection and distinguish between imported cases and ongoing local transmission.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Keisuke Ejima","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Kwang Su Kim","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Ito","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shoya Iwanami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Ohashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Koizumi","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Koichi Watashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Ana I Bento","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Casper J.

Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The rise in fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise in death cases should be proportional to the rise in virus infections. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of deaths were analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that basic epidemiological parameters differ between countries to an extent compromising epidemiological predictions of the pandemic. It also suggests that suppression of spread in Italy and the US may be more difficult to achieve. Although we assume that variations in social behaviour are responsible for the different estimates of R0, selection of more rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Despite uncertainty in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a working hypothesis demanding further investigations. As the number of deaths rapidly increases worldwide, we encourage more sophisticated modelling of the epidemic based on the dynamics of death cases by experts in the field.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Armin Ensser","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg FAU"},{"author_name":"Klaus Ueberla","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg FAU"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Ito","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shoya Iwanami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Ohashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Koizumi","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Koichi Watashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Ana I Bento","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Casper J.

Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario. Materials & Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID- 19. The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set) ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray images. The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19. Conclusion : The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital images of the chest X- rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for the health professionals.

Through careful inspection of the spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) from six cases with postmortem examinations, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect secondary lymphoid organs to induce cell death. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expresses on tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages in spleens and LNs. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) can be found in ACE2+ cells, CD169+ macrophages, but not in CD3+ T cells or B220+ B cells in spleens and LNs. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe tissue damage including lymph follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions. Moreover, in situ TUNEL staining illustrated that viral infection leads to severe lymphocyte apoptosis, which might be mediated by viral antigens inducing Fas upregulation.

However, most cases reported in February 2020 were local infections with unknown source, indicating local community transmissions. This study aimed to report the clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic characteristics of the local cases of COVID-19 in our community. Methods: We extracted the demographic, clinical and epidemiological data from 50 COVID-19 patients, who accounted for 53.8% of the cases in Hong Kong by the end of February 2020. We used both Nanopore and Illumina platforms to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from these patients. Phylogenetic relatedness among these local cases and their placement in the global phylogeny were examined. The evolutionary rate and divergence time of transmission were also determined. Findings: Of these 50 patients, only three (6.0%) had visited Wuhan while 43 (86.0%) did not have recent travel records. The average interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8.5 days. The most common signs and symptoms on admission were cough (74.0%) and fever (58.0%). Radiographic abnormality was found in 46 (92.0%) patients. Three (6.0%) patients required ICU admission. Phylogenetic analysis concurred with epidemiological investigation that 42 (84.0%) cases could be grouped into six transmission clusters. Forty-four (88.0%) cases harboured a common mutation Orf3a G251V. Global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that most (88.0%) cases in Hong Kong were clustered in two subclades with the strains from other countries. The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of COVID-2019 outbreak in Hong Kong was December 24, 2019 with an evolutionary rate of 3.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year. The reproduction number value was 1.84 as of February 28, 2020 in Hong Kong. Interpretation: We provided a territory-wide overview of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, which has borders connecting to Mainland China. Transmission in closed settings especially during family and religious gatherings is a hallmark of the recently reported cases. The reproduction number value indicated an ongoing outbreak in the community. Social distancing and vigilant epidemiological control are crucial to the containment of COVID-19 transmission","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth Siu-Sing Leung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Timothy Ting-Leung Ng","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Alan Ka-Lun Wu","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miranda Chong-Yee Yau","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hiu-Yin Lao","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Pan Choi","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Kingsley King-Gee Tam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lam-Kwong Lee","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Barry Kin-Chung Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alex Yat-Man Ho","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kam-Tong Yip","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Cheung Lung","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raymond Wai-To Liu","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eugene Yuk-Keung Tso","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wai-Shing Leung","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Man-Chun Chan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuk-Yung Ng","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20044339","rel_title":"Estimating the size of COVID-19 epidemic outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20044339","rel_abs":"In this work, we analyze the epidemic data of cumulative infected cases collected from many countries as reported by WHO starting from January 21st,2020 and up till March 21st,2020. Our inspection is motivated by the renormalization group (RG) framework. Here we propose the RG-inspired logistic function of the form E(t) = a(1 + ec(t-t0))-n as an epidemic strength function with n being asymmetry in the modified logistic function. We perform the non-linear least-squares analysis with data from various countries. The uncertainty for model parameters is computed using the squared root of the corresponding diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We carefully divide countries under consideration into 2 categories based on the estimation of the inflection point: the maturing phase and the growth-dominated phase. We observe that long-term estimations of cumulative infected cases of countries in the maturing phase for both n=1 and n= 1 are close to each other. We find from the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) that the RG-inspired logistic model with n= 1 is slightly preferable in this category. We also argue that n determines the characteristic of the epidemic at an early stage. However, in the second category, the estimated asymptotic number of cumulative infected cases contain rather large uncertainty. Therefore, in the growth-dominated phase, we focus on using n= 1 for countries in this phase. Some of them are in an early stage of an epidemic with an insufficient amount of data leading to a large uncertainty on parameter fits. In terms of the accuracy of the size estimation, the results do strongly depend on limitations on data collection and the epidemic phase for each country.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chakrit Pongkitivanichkul","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Daris Samart","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Takol Tangphati","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Phanit Koomhin","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160"},{"author_name":"Pimchanok Pimton","author_inst":"School of Science, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Punsiri Dam-O","author_inst":"School of Science, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Apirak Payaka","author_inst":"College of Graduate Studies, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Phongpichit Channuie","author_inst":"College of Graduate Studies, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Barry Kin-Chung Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alex Yat-Man Ho","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kam-Tong Yip","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Cheung Lung","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raymond Wai-To Liu","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eugene Yuk-Keung Tso","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wai-Shing Leung","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Man-Chun Chan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuk-Yung Ng","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.20046706","rel_title":"No Evidence for Temperature-Dependence of the COVID-19 Epidemic","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.20046706","rel_abs":"The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease extended from China across the north-temperate zone, and more recently to the tropics and southern hemisphere.

Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joan C Smith","author_inst":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Erin L.

Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31-mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compared with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS-CoV-2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS-CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type (-53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild-type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding. Due to the urgent situation created by COVID-19, we share these computational data to the community, which should be helpful to develop potential antiviral peptide drugs to combat this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Huang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robin Pearce","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Monet Lou Yuan","author_inst":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Kristen M.

Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses - the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 - exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000), and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009). Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins. The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again.\n\nIn BriefThe Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows frequent recombination in its evolutionary history. We characterize the extent of this genetic exchange and identify non-recombining regions of the sarbecovirus genome using three independent methods to remove the effects of recombination. Using these non-recombining genome regions and prior information on coronavirus evolutionary rates, we obtain estimates from three approaches that the most likely divergence date of SARS-CoV-2 from its most closely related available bat sequences ranges from 1948 to 1982.\n\nKey PointsO_LIRaTG13 is the closest available bat virus to SARS-CoV-2; a sub-lineage of these bat viruses is able to infect humans. Two sister lineages of the RaTG13\/SARS-CoV-2 lineage infect Malayan pangolins.\nC_LIO_LIThe sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events, indicating that there are high levels of co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and substantial genetic diversity; the sarbecoviruses are efficient  explorers of phenotype space.\nC_LIO_LIThe SARS-CoV-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant, at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin viruses sampled to date.\nC_LIO_LINon-recombinant regions of the sarbecoviruses can be identified, allowing for phylogenetic inference and dating to be performed. We constructed three such regions using different methods.\nC_LIO_LIWe estimate that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 diverged 40 to 70 years ago. There is a diverse unsampled reservoir of generalist viruses established in horseshoe bats.\nC_LIO_LIWhile an intermediate host responsible for the zoonotic event cannot be ruled out, the relevant evolution for spillover to humans very likely occurred in horseshoe bats.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maciej F Boni","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lemey","author_inst":"Katholieke University, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Tommy Tsan-Yuk Lam","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Blair Perry","author_inst":"Department of Biology, University of Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Todd Castoe","author_inst":"Department of Biology, University of Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rambaut","author_inst":"Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"David L Robertson","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, UK"},{"author_name":"Phongpichit Channuie","author_inst":"College of Graduate Studies, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Barry Kin-Chung Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alex Yat-Man Ho","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kam-Tong Yip","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Cheung Lung","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raymond Wai-To Liu","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eugene Yuk-Keung Tso","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wai-Shing Leung","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Man-Chun Chan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuk-Yung Ng","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.008631","rel_title":"Azithromycin and ciprofloxacin have a chloroquine-like effect on respiratory epithelial cells","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.008631","rel_abs":"There is interest in the use of chloroquine\/hydroxychloroquine (CQ\/HCQ) and azithromycin (AZT) in COVID-19 therapy. Employing cystic fibrosis respiratory epithelial cells, here we show that drugs AZT and ciprofloxacin (CPX) act as acidotropic lipophilic weak bases and confer in vitro effects on intracellular organelles similar to the effects of CQ. These seemingly disparate FDA-approved antimicrobials display a common property of modulating pH of endosomes and trans-Golgi network. We believe this may in part help understand the potentially beneficial effects of CQ\/HCQ and AZT in COVID-19, and that the present considerations of HCQ and AZT for clinical trials should be extended to CPX.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vojo Deretic","author_inst":"University of New Mexico School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Graham S Timmins","author_inst":"UNiversity of New Mexico HSC"},{"author_name":"Tommy Tsan-Yuk Lam","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Blair Perry","author_inst":"Department of Biology, University of Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Todd Castoe","author_inst":"Department of Biology, University of Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rambaut","author_inst":"Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"David L Robertson","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, UK"},{"author_name":"Phongpichit Channuie","author_inst":"College of Graduate Studies, Walailak University, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 80160, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Barry Kin-Chung Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alex Yat-Man Ho","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kam-Tong Yip","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Cheung Lung","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raymond Wai-To Liu","author_inst":"Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eugene Yuk-Keung Tso","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wai-Shing Leung","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Man-Chun Chan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuk-Yung Ng","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kit-Man Sin","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau-Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandy Ka-Yee Chau","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wing-Kin To","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tak-Lun Que","author_inst":"Tuen Mun Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Ho-Keung Shum","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shea Ping Yip","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Wing-Cheong Yam","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilman Kit Hang Siu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"}]}
