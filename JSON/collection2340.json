Tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibodies are indicative but unreliable measures of exposure. Here instead, for four highly-affected countries, we determine population susceptibilities by directly comparing country-wide observed epidemic dynamics data with that with their main metropolitan regions. We find significant susceptibility reductions in the metropolitan regions as a result of earlier seeding, with a relatively longer phase of exponential growth before the introduction of public health interventions. During the post-growth phase, the lower susceptibility of these regions contributed to the decline in cases, independent of intervention effects. Forward projections indicate that non-metropolitan regions will be more affected during recurrent epidemic waves compared with the initially heavier-hit metropolitan regions. Our findings have consequences for disease forecasts and resource utilisation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas J.

COVID-19 data and social-economic features of 1236 regions in the world (1112 re-gions at the provincial level and 124 countries with small land area) were collected. A Large-scale satellite data was combined with these data with a regression analysis model to explore effects of temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 spreading, as well as the possible transmission risk by seasonal cycles. The result show that temper-ature and relative humidity are shown to be negatively correlated with COVID-19 transmission throughout the world. Further, the effect of temperature and humidity is almost linear based on our samples, with uncertainty sur-rounding any nonlinear effects. Government intervention (e.g. lockdown policies) and lower population movement contributed to the decrease the new daily case ratio. The conclusions withstand several robustness checks, such as observation scales and maximum\/minimum temperature. Weather conditions are not the decisive factor in COVID-19 transmission, in that government intervention as well as public awareness, could contribute to the miti-gation of the spreading of the virus. As temperature drops in winter, the transmission possibly speeds up again.

However, these studies mostly compared observed to expected rates of smoking without direct comparison with individual controls. Objective To examine the association of nicotine-replacement therapy, as a surrogate of smoking, with hospitalization and all-cause mortality during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France. Methods We conducted a nationwide matched exposed\/unexposed cohort study using information from the French national health data system which covers the entire French population. We conducted two separate analyses, the first in individuals exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy without major smoking-related diseases (cancer, cardiovascular and\/or respiratory diseases) and the second in those presenting these conditions. We included all individuals, aged between 18 and 75 years, who had been reimbursed at least one nicotine-replacement therapy between November 15, 2019, and February 15, 2020. For each exposed individual, we randomly selected, from the entire Metropolitan French population, up to two non-exposed individuals (1:2) matched for the following variables: age (same year of birth), sex, department of residence (n=96 in Metropolitan France), and complementary universal health insurance (CMU-C). The three end points were a hospitalization with Covid-19, a death or an intubation in hospitalized patients with Covid-19, and all-cause mortality. We compared outcomes in individuals who were exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy with those in individuals who were not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Results In the first analysis, 297,070 individuals without major smoking-related diseases exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy were matched with 558,228 unexposed individuals without major smoking-related diseases. Individuals were aged on average 45.6 years (standard deviation: 12.7) and 48.8% were male. From February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020, hospitalization with Covid-19 occurred in 647 patients (151 patients in the nicotine-replacement therapy group and 496 patients in the unexposed group). In the main multivariable analysis, nicotine-replacement therapy was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization with Covid-19 compared with unexposed individuals (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.61). Nicotine-replacement therapy exposure was also associated with a decreased risk of intubation or death in hospitalized individuals with Covid-19 (13 vs. 73 patients, hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.57) but with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (251 vs. 231 deaths, hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.80). In the second analysis, 128,768 individuals with major smoking-related diseases exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy were matched with 243,793 unexposed individuals. Individuals were aged on average 55.3 years (standard deviation: 11.4) and 53.3% were male. In the main multivariable analysis, nicotine-replacement therapy exposure was neither associated with risk of hospitalization with Covid-19 (240 patients in the nicotine-replacement therapy group and 398 patients in the unexposed group, hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.38) nor with risk of death or an intubation in hospitalized individuals with Covid-19 (48 vs. 61 patients, hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.54). All-cause mortality was higher in the nicotine-replacement therapy group (1040 vs. 366 deaths, hazard ratio, 3.83; 95% CI, 3.41 to 4.31). Conclusions This large-scale observational study suggests that smoking, measured by exposure to nicotine-replacement therapy, was associated with an increased risk of overall mortality during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France, although it was associated with a lower risk of severe Covid-19 in individuals without major related-smoking diseases. Experimental and clinical studies are needed to disentangle the potential mechanisms of nicotine and\/or smoking in Covid-19 risk. Whatever the nature of these associations, the global impact of smoking is harmful for health even over a short epidemic period.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahmoud Zureik","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Berangere Baricault","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Celementine Vabre","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Laura SEMENZATO","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Jerome Drouin","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Francois cuenot","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Laetitia penso","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Philippe Herlemont","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Emilie Sbidian","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Alain Weill","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Molimard","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Rosemary Dray-Spira","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Jeremie Botton","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.28.20164087","rel_title":"COVID-19: Time-Dependent Effective Reproduction Number and Sub-notification Effect Estimation Modeling","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.28.20164087","rel_abs":"Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and health authorities have sought to identify the different parameters that govern their infection and death cycles, in order to be able to make better decisions.

This displacement of students from the wards has limited experiential learning opportunities. Concurrently, outpatient practices are experiencing reduced volumes of in-person visits and shifting towards virtual healthcare. This transition comes with its own logistical challenges. Here, we discuss a workflow that enabled students to engage in meaningful clinical education while helping the RWJMS outpatient practices implement remote telehealth visits. Methods: A four-week virtual elective was designed to offer clerkship students the opportunity to participate in virtual telehealth patient encounters. Students were prepared with EMR training and introduced to an outpatient workflow that supports healthcare providers in the ambulatory setting. Patients were consented to telehealth services before encounters with students. All collected clinical information was documented in the EMR, after which students transitioned patients to a virtual Doxy.me video call appointment. Clinical and educational outcomes of students' participation were evaluated. Results: Survey results showed students felt well-prepared to initiate patient encounters. They also expressed comfort while engaging with patients virtually during telehealth appointments. Students further identified educational value, citing opportunities to develop patient management plans consistent with in-person clinical experiences. A significant healthcare burden was also alleviated by student involvement. Over 1000 total scheduled appointments were serviced by students who transitioned over 80% of patients into virtual provider waiting rooms. Discussion: After piloting this elective with rising fourth-year students, pre-clerkship students were also recruited to act in a role normally associated with clinical learners (e.g., elicit patient histories, conduct a review of systems, etc.). An additional telehealth elective is being designed so medical students can contribute to inpatient care without risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

We pooled data on occupational surveillance of 10,654 HCW who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in six Italian centers. Information was available on demographics, job title, department of employment, source of exposure, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and COVID-19-related symptoms. We fitted multivariable logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Findings. The prevalence of infection varied across centers and ranged from 3.0% to 22.0%, being strongly correlated with that of the respective areas. Women were at lower risk of infection compared to men. Fever, cough, dyspnea and malaise were the symptoms most strongly associated with infection, together with anosmia and ageusia. No differences in the risk of infection were detected between job titles, or working in a COVID-19 designated department. Reported contact with a patient inside or outside the workplace was a risk factor. Use of a mask was strongly protective against risk of infection as was use of gloves. The use of a mask by the source of exposure (patient or colleague) had an independent effect in reducing infection risk.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paolo Boffetta","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Francesco Violante","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paolo Durando","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Palma","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties, Radiological Sciences, and Public Health, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Enrico Pira","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luigi Vimercati","author_inst":"Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine, University of Bari, Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Cristaudo","author_inst":"University Hospital Pisana, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Icardi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Emma Sala","author_inst":"University Hospital Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Coggiola","author_inst":"University Hospital City of Health and Science of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvio Tafuri","author_inst":"Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine, University of Bari, Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vittorio Gattini","author_inst":"University Hospital Pisana, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pietro Apostoli","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties, Radiological Sciences, and Public Health, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Spatari","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Dentistry Sciences and Morphological and Functional Imaging, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"},{"author_name":"- Working Group on SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italian healthcare workers","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20160101","rel_title":"Red blood cells injuries and hypersegmented neutrophils in COVID-19 peripheral blood film","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20160101","rel_abs":"In the current investigation, peripheral blood films of 15 COVID-19 patients (44.78{+\/-}16.55 years), proven by computed tomographic imaging and RT-PCR for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed at the moment of hospital admission.

We divided patients into the stable group (SG) and the progression group (PG) (patients requiring mechanical ventilation). We compared the clinical factors in both groups. We established the cutoff values (COVs) for significantly different factors via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and evaluated risk factors by univariate regression. Results: We enrolled 57 COVID-19 patients (median age 52 years, 56.1% male). The median progression time from symptom onset was eight days. Seven patients developed critical disease (PG: 12.2%), two (3.5%) of whom died; 50 had stable disease. Univariate logistic analysis identified elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (COV: 309 U\/l), decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (COV: 68 ml\/min), lymphocytopenia (COV: 980\/l), and statin use as significantly associated with disease progression.

Aims: This study was performed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical outcomes of Healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections (HA-COVID-19) during the 2020 epidemic and study factors which may promote or correlate with its incidence and transmission in a London Teaching Hospital Trust. Methods: Electronic laboratory, patient and staff self-reported sickness records were interrogated for the period 1st March to 18th April 2020. HA-COVID-19 was defined as symptom onset >14d of admission. Test performance of a single combined throat and nose swab (CTNS) for patient placement and the effect of delayed RNA positivity (DRP, defined as >48h delay) on patient outcomes was evaluated. The incidence of staff self-reported COVID-19 sickness absence, hospital bed occupancy, community incidence and DRP was compared HA-COVID-19. The incidence of other significant hospital-acquired bacterial infections (OHAI) was compared to previous years. Results: 58 HA-COVID-19 (7.1%) cases were identified. As compared to community-acquired cases, significant differences were observed in age (p=0.018), ethnicity (p<0.001) and comorbidity burden (p<0.001) but not in 30d mortality. CTNS negative predictive value was 60.3%. DRP was associated with greater mortality (p=0.034) and 34.5% HA-COVID-19 cases could be traced to delayed diagnosis in CA-COVID-19. Incidence of HA-COVID-19 correlated positively with DRP (R=0.7108) and staff sickness absence (R=0.7815). OHAI rates were similar to previous 2 years. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and isolation of COVID-19 would help reduce transmission. A single CTNS has limited value in segregating patients into positive and negative pathways.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirstin Khonyongwa","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Surabhi K Taori","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Ana Soares","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Nergish Desai","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Malur Sudhanva","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Silke Schelenz","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa A Curran","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Masami Inada","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kinya Abe","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mokrane Iguer-Ouada","author_inst":"AME Laboratory, Faculty of Nature and Life Sciences, Abderrahmane Mira University 06000 Bejaia, Algeria."},{"author_name":"Vittorio Gattini","author_inst":"University Hospital Pisana, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pietro Apostoli","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties, Radiological Sciences, and Public Health, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Spatari","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Dentistry Sciences and Morphological and Functional Imaging, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"},{"author_name":"- Working Group on SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italian healthcare workers","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20163287","rel_title":"The relationship between demographic, psychosocial and health-related parameters and the impact of COVID-19: a study of twenty-four Indian regions","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20163287","rel_abs":"Objectives: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has varied widely across nations and even in different regions of the same nation.

The relationship between these parameters and demographic, social, psychological and health-related indices in these states was examined using both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results: A variety of factors - state population, sex ratio, and burden of diarrhoeal disease and ischemic heart disease - were associated with measures of the impact of COVID-19 on bivariate analyses. On multivariate analyses, prevalence and crude mortality rate were both significantly and negatively associated with the sex ratio. Conclusions: These results suggest that the transmission and impact of COVID-19 in a given population may be influenced by a number of variables, with demographic factors showing the most consistent association.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ravi Philip Rajkumar","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research"},{"author_name":"Surabhi K Taori","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Ana Soares","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Nergish Desai","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Malur Sudhanva","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Silke Schelenz","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa A Curran","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Masami Inada","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kinya Abe","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mokrane Iguer-Ouada","author_inst":"AME Laboratory, Faculty of Nature and Life Sciences, Abderrahmane Mira University 06000 Bejaia, Algeria."},{"author_name":"Vittorio Gattini","author_inst":"University Hospital Pisana, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pietro Apostoli","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties, Radiological Sciences, and Public Health, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Spatari","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Dentistry Sciences and Morphological and Functional Imaging, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"},{"author_name":"- Working Group on SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italian healthcare workers","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.20162701","rel_title":"Estimates of the rate of infection and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease in a population sample from SE England","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.20162701","rel_abs":"Background: Understanding of the true asymptomatic rate of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is currently limited, as is understanding of the population-based seroprevalence after the first wave of COVID-19 within the UK. The majority of data thus far come from hospitalised patients, with little focus on general population cases, or their symptoms. Methods: We undertook enzyme linked immunosorbent assay characterisation of IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein of 431 unselected general-population participants of the TwinsUK cohort from South-East England, aged 19-86 (median age 48; 85% female). 382 participants completed prospective logging of 14 COVID-19 related symptoms via the COVID Symptom Study App, allowing consideration of serology alongside individual symptoms, and a predictive algorithm for estimated COVID-19 previously modelled on PCR positive individuals from a dataset of over 2 million. Findings: We demonstrated a seroprevalence of 12% (51participants of 431). Of 48 seropositive individuals with full symptom data, nine (19%) were fully asymptomatic, and 16 (27%) were asymptomatic for core COVID-19 symptoms: fever, cough or anosmia. Specificity of anosmia for seropositivity was 95%, compared to 88% for fever cough and anosmia combined. 34 individuals in the cohort were predicted to be Covid-19 positive using the App algorithm, and of those, 18 (52%) were seropositive. Interpretation: Seroprevalence amongst adults from London and South-East England was 12%, and 19% of seropositive individuals with prospective symptom logging were fully asymptomatic throughout the study. Anosmia demonstrated the highest symptom specificity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody response.

RNA-extraction step has been a major rate-limiting step in implementing high-throughput screening for COVID-19 during this pandemic. Moreover, clinical laboratories are facing several challenges that include cost, reagents, instrumentation, turn-around time, trained personnel, and supply-chain constraints to efficiently implement and sustain testing. Cognizant of these limitations, we evaluated the extraction-free methods described in the literature and have developed an innovative, simplified and easy protocol employing limited reagents to extract RNA for subsequent RT-PCR analysis. Nasopharyngeal-swab samples were subjected to the following individual conditions: 65{degrees}C for 15 minutes; 80{degrees}C for 5 minutes; 90{degrees}C for 5 minutes or 80{degrees}C for 1 minute, and processed for direct RT-PCR. These groups were also compared with a supplemental protocol adding isopropanol-ethanol-water elution steps followed by RT-PCR assay. The direct RT-PCR assay did not detect SARS-CoV-2 within the various temperature incubation only groups, whereas, the 90{degrees}C for 5 minutes-isopropanol-ethanol-water method was found to be comparable to the FDA-EUA method. Evaluation of the performance metrics for 100 clinical samples demonstrated a sensitivity of 94.2% and a specificity of 100%. The limit of detection was ascertained to be ~40 copies\/ml by absolute-quantification. The protocol presented for this assay employs limited reagents and yields results with high sensitivity. Additionally, it presents a simplified methodology that would be easier to implement in laboratories in limited resource countries in order to meet the high current COVID-19 testing needs.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikhil Shri Sahajpal","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Ashis K Mondal","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Allan Njau","author_inst":"Aga Khan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sudha Ananth","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Arvind Kothandaraman","author_inst":"PerkinElmer Inc."},{"author_name":"Madhuri Hegde","author_inst":"PerkinElmer Inc."},{"author_name":"Alka Chaubey","author_inst":"PerkinElmer"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Padala","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Vamsi Kota","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Caspary","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Mark Tompkins","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Ted M.

Our objective was to develop a decision model that supports prioritization of care from a utilitarian perspective, which is to minimize population health loss. Methods A cohort state-transition model was developed and applied to 43 semi-elective non-paediatric surgeries commonly performed in academic hospitals. Scenarios of delaying surgery from two weeks were compared with delaying up to one year, and no surgery at all. Model parameters were based on registries, scientific literature, and the World Health Organization global burden of disease study. For each surgery, the urgency was estimated as the average expected loss of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) per month. Results Given the best available evidence, the two most urgent surgeries were bypass surgery for Fontaine III\/IV peripheral arterial disease (0.23 QALY loss\/month, 95%-CI: 0.09-0.24) and transaortic valve implantation (0.15 QALY loss\/month, 95%-CI: 0.09-0.24). The two least urgent surgeries were placing a shunt for dialysis (0.01, 95%-CI: 0.005-0.01) and thyroid carcinoma resection (0.01, 95%-CI: 0.01-0.02): these surgeries were associated with a limited amount of health lost on the waiting list. Conclusion Expected health loss due to surgical delay can be objectively calculated with our decision model based on best available evidence, which can guide prioritization of surgeries to minimize population health loss in times of scarcity. This tool should yet be placed in the context of different ethical perspectives and combined with capacity management tools to facilitate large-scale implementation.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Gravesteijn","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Eline Krijkamp","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Jan Busschbach","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Geert Geleijnse","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Isabel Retel Helmrich","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Sophie Bruinsma","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Celine van Lint","author_inst":"Value Based Operation Room Triage team collaborators: Chris Bangma, Ivo Beetz, Patrick Bindels, Alexandra Brandt-Kerkhof, Danielle van Diepen, Clemens Dirven, T"},{"author_name":"Ernest van Veen","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Ewout Steyerberg","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Cornelis Verhoef","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Jan van Saase","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Hester Lingsma","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Robert Baatenburg de Jong","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"- Value Based Operation Room Triage team collaborators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Helin Sertkaya","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Thomas Maguire","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Edward Scourfield","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Ruth Bowyer","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Deborah Hart","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Aoife O'Byrne","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Steele","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Carolina Rosadas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Myra McClure","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joan Capedevila-Pujol","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Jonathan wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourseilin","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Matthew Brown","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Michael Malim","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"surgery"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20163212","rel_title":"Association between Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20163212","rel_abs":"Background In observational studies, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with an increased risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the prognosis of COVID-19 can affect nervous systems.

In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS CoV-2 infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which nineteen elderly residents were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Based on the increased susceptibility to viral-induced cytokine release syndrome inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population, the patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. Results: All the patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable and 18 out of 19 (94.7%) patients were discharged clinically recovered with negative RT-PCR at 13 days (median). One dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased in the first 24-48 hours in patients with high baseline values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminary assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients, which did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. Control subjects were well-matched regarding age, comorbidities and severity of the disease. Every three moderately ill patients treated with itolizumab, one admission in intensive care unit (ICU) was prevented. Discussion\/Conclusion: Itolizumab was well tolerated. Its effect is associated with a reduction and controlling IL-6 serum levels. Moreover, treated patients had a favorable clinical outcome, considering their poor prognosis. This treatment is associated significantly with a decrease the risk to be admitted in ICU and reduced 10 times the risk of death. This study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab, in combination with other antiviral and anticoagulant therapies, is associated with a reduction the COVID-19 disease worsening and mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19 and suggests its possible use in patients with cytokine release syndrome from other pathologies.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayra Ramos-Suzarte","author_inst":"Center of Molecular immunology"},{"author_name":"Yayquier Diaz","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Yordanis Martin","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Nestor Antonio Calderon","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"William Santiago","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Orlando Vinet","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Yulieski La O","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Jorge Perez","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Augusto Oyarzabal","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Yoan Perez","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Geidy Lorenzo","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Meylan Cepeda","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Danay Saavedra","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Zayma Mazorra","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Daymys Estevez","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Patricia Lorenzo-Luaces","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Carmen Valenzuela","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Armando Caballero","author_inst":"Arnaldo Milian Castro Universitary Hospital.

Recent reports have raised the concern that antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent patients may not be long lasting and thus even these individuals may require vaccination. Vaccine candidates currently in clinical testing have focused on the SARS-CoV-2 wild type spike (S) protein (S-WT) as the major antigen of choice and while pre-clinical and early clinical testing have shown that S elicits an antibody response, we believe the optimal vaccine candidate should be capable of inducing robust, durable T-cell responses as well as humoral responses. We report here on a next generation bivalent human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) vaccine capable of inducing immunity in patients with pre-existing adenovirus immunity, comprising both an S sequence optimized for cell surface expression (S-Fusion) and a conserved nucleocapsid (N) antigen designed to be transported to the endosomal subcellular compartment, with the potential to generate durable immune protection. Our studies suggest that this bivalent vaccine is optimized for immunogenicity as evidenced by the following findings: (i) The optimized S-Fusion displayed improved S receptor binding domain (RBD) cell surface expression compared to S-WT where little surface expression was detected; (ii) the expressed RBD from S-Fusion retained conformational integrity and recognition by ACE2-Fc; (iii) the viral N protein modified with an enhanced T-cell stimulation domain (ETSD) localized to endosomal\/lysosomal subcellular compartments for MHC I\/II presentation; and (iv) these optimizations to S and N (S-Fusion and N-ETSD) generated enhanced de novo antigen-specific B cell and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in antigen-naive pre-clinical models. Both the T-cell and antibody immune responses to S and N demonstrated a T-helper 1 (Th1) bias. The antibody responses were neutralizing as demonstrated by two independent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. Based on these findings, we are advancing this next generation bivalent hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine as our lead clinical candidate to test for its ability to provide robust, durable cell-mediated and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are ongoing to explore utilizing this vaccine construct in oral, intranasal, and sublingual formulations to induce mucosal immunity in addition to cell-mediated and humoral immunity. The ultimate goal of an ideal COVID-19 vaccine is to generate long-term T and B cell memory.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian Rice","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mohit Verma","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Annie Shin","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Lise Zakin","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Peter Sieling","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shiho Tanaka","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Helty Adisetiyo","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Justin Taft","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Roosheel Sandeep Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sofija Buta","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Martin-Fernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Brett Morimoto","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gabitzsch","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jeffrey T Safrit","author_inst":"NantKwest, Inc."},{"author_name":"Joseph Balint","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyle Dinkins","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patricia Spilman","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dusan Bogunovic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shahrooz Rabizadeh","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kayvan Niazi","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patrick Soon-Shiong","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Carolina Rosadas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Myra McClure","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joan Capedevila-Pujol","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Jonathan wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourseilin","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Matthew Brown","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Michael Malim","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.228213","rel_title":"No SARS-CoV-2 cross-neutralization by intravenous immunoglobulins produced from plasma collected before the 2020 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.228213","rel_abs":"The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is caused by a zoonotic coronavirus transmitted to humans, similar to earlier events.

Herein, we report the comprehensive and precise site-specific O-glycosylation landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, which were characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Following digestion using trypsin and trypsin\/Glu-C, and de-N-glycosylation using PNGase F, we determined the mucin-type (GalNAc-type) O-glycosylation pattern of S proteins, including unambiguous O-glycosites and the 6 most common O-glycans occupying them, via Byonic identification and manual validation. Finally, 43 O-glycosites were identified in the insect cell-expressed S protein. Most glycosites were modified by non-sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex(1). In contrast, 30 O-glycosites were identified in the human cell-expressed S protein S1 subunit. Most glycosites were modified by sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(2). Our results are the first to reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a mucin-type glycoprotein; clustered O-glycans often occur in the N- and the C-termini of the S protein, and the O-glycosite and O-glycan compositions vary with the host cell type. These site-specific O-glycosylation landscapes of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein are expected to provide novel insights into the viral binding mechanism and present a strategy for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanjun Zhao","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Mao","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yaohui Chen","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Liqiang Hu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jingqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Meng Gong","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jingqiu Cheng","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hao Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Julian Kwan","author_inst":"Center for Network Systems Biology, Departments of Biochemistry and Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Andrew Emili","author_inst":"Center for Network Systems Biology, Departments of Biochemistry and Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Richard D Cummings","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gabitzsch","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jeffrey T Safrit","author_inst":"NantKwest, Inc."},{"author_name":"Joseph Balint","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyle Dinkins","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patricia Spilman","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dusan Bogunovic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shahrooz Rabizadeh","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kayvan Niazi","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patrick Soon-Shiong","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Carolina Rosadas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Myra McClure","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joan Capedevila-Pujol","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Jonathan wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourseilin","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Matthew Brown","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Michael Malim","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.228890","rel_title":"EUAdb: a resource for COVID-19 test development","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.228890","rel_abs":"Due to the sheer number of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) cases, the prevalence of asymptomatic cases and the fact that undocumented cases appear to be significant for transmission of the causal virus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), there is an urgent need for increased SARS-CoV-2 testing capability that is both efficient and effective1. In response to the growing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in February, 2020, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) began issuing Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to laboratories and commercial manufacturers for the development and implementation of diagnostic tests1. So far, the gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection is the RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) test2. However, the authorized RT-qPCR test protocols vary widely, not only in the reagents, controls, and instruments they use, but also in the SARS-CoV-2 genes they target, what results constitute a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their limit of detection (LoD). The FDA has provided a web site that lists most of the tests that have been issued EUAs, along with links to the authorization letters and summary documents describing these tests1. However, it is very challenging to use this site to compare or replicate these tests for a variety of reasons. First, at least 12 of 18 tests for EUA submissions made prior to March 31, 2020, are not listed there. To our knowledge, no EUAs have been issued for these applications. Second, the data are not standardized and are only provided as longhand prose in the summary documents. Third, some details (e.g. primer sequences) are absent from several of the test descriptions. Fourth, for tests provided by commercial manufacturers, summary documents are completely missing. To address at least the first three issues, we have developed a database, EUAdb (EUAdb.org), that holds standardized information about EUA-issued tests and is focused on RT-qPCR diagnostic tests, or \"high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests\"1. By providing a standardized ontology and curated data in a relational architecture, we seek to facilitate comparability and reproducibility, with the ultimate goal of consistent, universal and high-quality testing nationwide. Here, we document the basics of the EUAdb data architecture and simple data queries. The source files can be provided to anyone who wants to modify the database for his\/her own research purposes. We ask that the original source of the files be made clear and that the database not be used in its original or modified forms for commercial purposes.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alyssa Woronik","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Henry W Shaffer","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Karin Kiontke","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Jon M Laurent","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ronald Zambrano","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jef D Boeke","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David H.A.

We have used a bioinformatic approach to aid in the design of an epitope peptide-based vaccine against the spike protein of the virus. Five antigenic B cell epitopes with viable antigenicity and a total of 27 discontinuous B cell epitopes were mapped out structurally in the spike protein for antibody recognition. We identified eight CD8+ T cell 9-mers along with 12 CD4+ T cell 14-15-mer as promising candidate epitopes putatively restricted by a large number of MHC-I and II alleles respectively. We used this information to construct an in silico chimeric peptide vaccine whose translational rate was highly expressed when cloned in pET28a (+) vector. The vaccine construct was predicted to elicit high antigenicity and cell-mediated immunity when given as a homologous prime-boost, with triggering of toll-like receptor 5 by the adjuvant linker. The vaccine was characterized by an increase in IgM and IgG and an array of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Upon in silico challenge with SARS-CoV-2, there was a decrease in antigen levels using our immune simulations. We therefore propose that potential vaccine designs consider this approach.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Onyeka S.

The positive single strand RNA genome of its causative agent, the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encodes all viral enzymes. In this work, we focus on one particular methyltransferase (MTase), nsp16, which in complex with nsp10 is capable of methylating the first nucleotide of a capped RNA strand at the 2'-O position. This process is part of a viral capping system and is crucial for viral evasion of the innate immune reaction. In light of recently discovered non-canonical RNA caps, we tested various dinucleoside polyphosphate-capped RNAs as substrates for nsp10-nsp16 MTase. We developed an LC-MS-based method and discovered five types of capped RNA (m7Gp3A(G)-, Gp3A(G)- and Gp4A-RNA) that are substrates of the nsp10-nsp16 MTase. Our technique is an alternative to the classical isotope labelling approach for measurement of 2'-O-MTase activity. Further, we determined the IC50 value of sinefungin (286 {+\/-} 66 nM) to illustrate the value of our approach for inhibitor screening.

Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a post-translocated SARS-CoV-2 RdRp core complex, comprising one nsp12, one separate nsp8(I) monomer, one nsp7-nsp8(II) subcomplex and a replicating RNA substrate. Compared with the recently reported SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complexes, the nsp8(I)\/nsp7 interface in this RdRp complex shifts away from the nsp12 polymerase. Further functional characterizations suggest that specific interactions between the nsp8(I) and nsp7, together with the rearrangement of nsp8(I)\/nsp7 interface, ensure the efficient and processive RNA synthesis by the RdRp complex. Our findings provide a mechanistic insight into how nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors regulate the polymerase activity of nsp12 and suggest a potential new intervention interface, in addition to the canonical polymerase active center, in RdRp for antiviral design.\n\nAuthor summarySince it was first discovered and reported in late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus is wreaking havoc around the world. Currently, no highly effective and specific antiviral drug is available for clinical treatment. Therefore, the threat of COVID-19 transmission necessitates the discovery of more effective antiviral strategies. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important antiviral drug target. Here, our cryo-EM structure of a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp\/RNA replicating complex reveals a previously uncharacterized overall shift of the cofactor nsp8(I)\/nsp7 interface, leading to its rearrangement. Through in vitro functional test, we found that the specific interactions on the interface are important to the efficient RNA polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. These observations let us to suggest this interface as a potential new drug intervention site, outside of the canonical polymerase active center, in RdRp for antiviral design. Our findings would provide new insights into regulatory mechanism of this novel SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, contribute to the design of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, and benefit the global public health.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Shi","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ming Chen","author_inst":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yang Yang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiyun Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Yangbo Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Bin Liu","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Daniel M Eze","author_inst":"University of Ibadan"},{"author_name":"Hao Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Julian Kwan","author_inst":"Center for Network Systems Biology, Departments of Biochemistry and Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Andrew Emili","author_inst":"Center for Network Systems Biology, Departments of Biochemistry and Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Richard D Cummings","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gabitzsch","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jeffrey T Safrit","author_inst":"NantKwest, Inc."},{"author_name":"Joseph Balint","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyle Dinkins","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patricia Spilman","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dusan Bogunovic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shahrooz Rabizadeh","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kayvan Niazi","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patrick Soon-Shiong","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Carolina Rosadas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Myra McClure","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joan Capedevila-Pujol","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Jonathan wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourseilin","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Matthew Brown","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Michael Malim","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.227470","rel_title":"Ad26-vector based COVID-19 vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike immunogen induces potent humoral and cellular immune responses","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.227470","rel_abs":"Development of effective preventative interventions against SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19 is urgently needed. The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g. prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S1) increased the ratio of neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively-folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-{gamma}. This optimized Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04436276).","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rinke Bos","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lucy Rutten","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Joan E.M. van der Lubbe","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mark J.G.

Circulating MT-DNA were sharply elevated in patients who eventually died, required ICU admission or intubation. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that high circulating MT-DNA levels is an independent risk factor for all of these outcomes after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. Additionally, we found that circulating MT-DNA has a similar or superior area-under-the curve when compared to clinically established measures of systemic inflammation, as well as emerging markers currently of interest as investigational targets for COVID-19 therapy. These results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels is a potential indicator for poor COVID-19 outcomes.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davide Scozzi","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Marlene Cano","author_inst":"Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Lina MA","author_inst":"Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Dequan Zhou","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Ji Hong Zhu","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Charles Goss","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Adriana Rauseo","author_inst":"Divisions of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Zhiyi Liu","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Valentina Peritore","author_inst":"Division of Thoracic Surgery, Department of medical-surgical science and translational medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Monica Rocco","author_inst":"Division of Anesthesiology, Department of medical-surgical science and translational medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alberto Ricci","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rachele Amodeo","author_inst":"Laboratory analysis-flow cytometry section, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Aimati","author_inst":"Laboratory analysis-flow cytometry section, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mohsen Ibrahim","author_inst":"Division Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, US; Division Thoracic Surgery, Department me"},{"author_name":"Ramsey Hachem","author_inst":"Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kreisel","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Philip A Mudd","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Hrishikesh S Kulkarni","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine; Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Lo"},{"author_name":"Andrew E Gelman","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery; Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri"},{"author_name":"Vellinga Jort","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Johannes PM Langedijk","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Roland C Zahn","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerome Custers","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hanneke Schuitemaker","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Joan Capedevila-Pujol","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Jonathan wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourseilin","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Matthew Brown","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Michael Malim","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.229377","rel_title":"Cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV structural protein antibodies against SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.229377","rel_abs":"There is currently a lack of biological tools to study the replication cycle and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19.

Here, we extensively characterized antibodies of the SARS-CoV structural proteins for their cross-reactivity, experimental utility, and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. We assessed a total of 10 antibodies (six for Spike, two for Membrane, and one for Nucleocapsid and Envelope viral protein). We evaluated the utility of these antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of assays, including immunofluorescence, ELISA, biolayer interferometry, western blots, and micro-neutralization. Remarkably, a high proportion of the antibodies we tested showed cross-reactivity, indicating a potentially generalizable theme of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These antibodies should help facilitate further research into SARS-CoV-2 basic biology. Moreover, our study provides critical information about the propensity of SARS-CoV antibodies to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and highlights its relevance in defining the clinical significance of such antibodies to improve testing and guide the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy A Bates","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Jules B Weinstein","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Scotland E Farley","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Hans C Leier","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"William B Messer","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Fikadu G Tafesse","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Adriana Rauseo","author_inst":"Divisions of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Zhiyi Liu","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Valentina Peritore","author_inst":"Division of Thoracic Surgery, Department of medical-surgical science and translational medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Monica Rocco","author_inst":"Division of Anesthesiology, Department of medical-surgical science and translational medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alberto Ricci","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rachele Amodeo","author_inst":"Laboratory analysis-flow cytometry section, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Aimati","author_inst":"Laboratory analysis-flow cytometry section, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mohsen Ibrahim","author_inst":"Division Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, US; Division Thoracic Surgery, Department me"},{"author_name":"Ramsey Hachem","author_inst":"Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kreisel","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Philip A Mudd","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"},{"author_name":"Hrishikesh S Kulkarni","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine; Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Lo"},{"author_name":"Andrew E Gelman","author_inst":"Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery; Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri"},{"author_name":"Vellinga Jort","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Johannes PM Langedijk","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Roland C Zahn","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerome Custers","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hanneke Schuitemaker","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Joan Capedevila-Pujol","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Jonathan wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourseilin","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Matthew Brown","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Michael Malim","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.28.20164012","rel_title":"A meta-review of systematic reviews and an updated meta-analysis on the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID19 infection","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.28.20164012","rel_abs":"Abstract Background There is an urgent need for an efficacious and safe treatment for COVID19. Several trials testing a variety of therapeutics are on-going. Some in-vitro studies found the anti-malarial drug chloroquine (CQ), and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are effective against COVID19. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials in humans have produced conflicting findings on the efficacy and safety of these drugs. Guidelines vary considerably and are hotly debated at political and scientific levels. Therefore, it has become necessary to provide a summary of the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in treating COVID19 infection, using an overview of the existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Objective To synthesize the findings presented in systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as to update the evidence using a meta-analysis in evaluating the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ with or without Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID19 infection. Methods The design of this meta-review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Systematic Reviews including harms checklist (PRIO-harms). A comprehensive search included several electronic databases in identifying all systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as experimental studies which investigated the efficacy and safety of CQ, HCQ with or without antibiotics as COVID19 treatment. Manual searches of the reference list of all included studies and a citation search of the top 20 papers supplemented the search. Findings from the systematic reviews and meta-analyses were reported using a structured summary including tables and forest plots. The updated meta-analysis of experimental studies was carried out using the distributional-assumption-free quality effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool for reviews and the MethodologicAl STandard for Epidemiological Research (MASTER) scale for the experimental studies. The main outcomes for both the meta-review and the updated meta-analysis were; mortality, transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), intubation or the need for mechanical ventilation, worsening of illness, viral clearance and the occurrence of adverse events. Results A total of 13 reviews with 40 primary studies comprising 113,000 participants were included. Most of the primary studies were observational (n=27) and the rest were experimental studies. Two meta-analyses reported a high risk of mortality with similar ORs of 2.5 for HCQ with Azithromycin. However, four other meta-analyses reported contradictory results with two reporting a high risk of mortality (OR ~ 2.2 to 3.0) and the other two reporting no significant association between HCQ with mortality. Most reviews reported that HCQ with or without Azithromycin had no significant effect on virological cure, disease exacerbation or the risk of transfer to the ICU, need for intubation or mechanical ventilation. After exclusion of studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria, the updated meta-analysis contained eight experimental studies (7 RCTs and 1 quasi-experimental trial), with a total of 5279 participants of whom 1856 were on either CQ\/HCQ or combined with Azithromycin. CQ\/HCQ with or without Azithromycin was significantly associated with a higher risk of adverse events (RR 5.7, 95%CI 2.4-13.7, I2 =55%, n = 5 studies). HCQ was not effective in reducing mortality (RR 1.0, 95%CI 1.0-1.2, I2 =0%, n=6 studies), transfer to the ICU, intubation or need for mechanical ventilation (RR 1.1, 95%CI 0.9-1.4, I2 =0%, n=3 studies) virological cure (RR 1.0, 95%CI 0.9-1.2, I2 =55%, n=5 studies) nor disease exacerbation (RR 1.2, 95%CI 0.3-5.0, I2 =29%, n=3 studies). Conclusion There is conclusive evidence that CQ and HCQ, with or without Azithromycin are not effective in treating COVID-19 or its exacerbation.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tawanda Chivese","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Omran A.H.
