We evaluated the protective activity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a pre-fusion stabilized spike protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge studies with Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of systemic and mucosal IgA and T cell responses, completely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and likely confers sterilizing immunity in most animals. Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, and curtailing pandemic spread.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed O Hassan","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Natasha M Kafai","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Igor P Dmitriev","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Julie M Fox","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Brittany Smith","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Ian B Harvey","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Rita E Chen","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Emma S Winkler","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Alex W Wessel","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Elena Kashentseva","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Broc T McCune","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Adam L Bailey","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Zhao","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Laura A VanBlargan","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Yanan Dai","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Meisheng Ma","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Lucas J Adams","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Swathi Shrihari","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Yixuan J Hou","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schaefer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Arthur S Kim","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Shamus P Keeler","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Daniela Weiskopf","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Michael J Holtzman","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Daved H Fremont","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"David T Curiel","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.206847","rel_title":"Longitudinal analysis of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in convalescent plasma donors","rel_date":"2020-07-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.206847","rel_abs":"Hema-Quebec, the blood supplier in the Province of Quebec, Canada, collects and tests convalescent plasma used in a clinical trial to determine the clinical efficacy of this product for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. So far, we have collected 1159 plasma units from 282 COVID-19 convalescent donors. The presence of antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in convalescent donors was established at the first donation. Seropositive donors were asked to donate additional plasma units every six days. Until now, 15 donors have donated at least four times and, in some cases, up to nine times. This allowed us to perform a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in these repeat donors, with the first donation occurring 33-77 days after symptoms onset and donations up to 71-114 days after symptoms onset thereafter. In all donors, the level of antibodies remained relatively stable up to about 76 days after symptoms onset but then started to decrease more rapidly to reach, in some convalescent donors, a seronegative status within 100-110 days after symptoms onset. The decline in anti-RBD antibodies was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the numbers of days after symptoms onset (r = 0.821). This suggests that de novo secretion of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies by short-lived plasma cells stopped about 2-3 months after disease onset, an observation that has important implications for convalescent plasma collection and seroprevalence studies undertaken several months after the peak of infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9e Perreault","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Tony Tremblay","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Marie-Jos\u00e9e Fournier","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Drouin","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussi\u00e8res","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Pr\u00e9vost","author_inst":"CRCHUM \/ Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"},{"author_name":"Antoine Lewin","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Philippe B\u00e9gin","author_inst":"CHU Ste-Justine"},{"author_name":"Andr\u00e9s Finzi","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"},{"author_name":"Ren\u00e9e Bazin","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Elena Kashentseva","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Broc T McCune","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Adam L Bailey","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Zhao","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Laura A VanBlargan","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Yanan Dai","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Meisheng Ma","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Lucas J Adams","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Swathi Shrihari","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Yixuan J Hou","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schaefer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Arthur S Kim","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Shamus P Keeler","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Daniela Weiskopf","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Michael J Holtzman","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Daved H Fremont","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"David T Curiel","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.204339","rel_title":"Mutational dynamics and transmission properties of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events in Austria","rel_date":"2020-07-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.204339","rel_abs":"Superspreading events shape the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we provide a national-scale analysis of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in Austria, a country that played a major role for virus transmission across Europe and beyond. Capitalizing on a national epidemiological surveillance system, we performed deep whole-genome sequencing of virus isolates from 576 samples to cover major Austrian SARS-CoV-2 clusters. Our data chart a map of early viral spreading in Europe, including the path from low-frequency mutations to fixation. Detailed epidemiological surveys enabled us to calculate the effective SARS-CoV-2 population bottlenecks during transmission and unveil time-resolved intra-patient viral quasispecies dynamics. This study demonstrates the power of integrating deep viral genome sequencing and epidemiological data to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 spreads through populations.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra Popa","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jakob-Wendelin Genger","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Michael Nicholson","author_inst":"Department of Data Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

Novel coronavirus or SARS-COV-2 strain is responsible for COVID-19 and it has already shown the deadly nature of respiratory disease by threatening the health of millions of lives across the globe. Clinical study reveals that a COVID-19 infected person may experience dry cough, muscle pain, headache, fever, sore throat and mild to moderate respiratory illness. At the same time, it affects the lungs badly with virus infection. So, the lung can be a prominent internal organ to diagnose the gravity of COVID-19 infection using X-Ray and CT scan images of chest. Despite having lengthy testing time, RT-PCR is a proven testing methodology to detect coronavirus infection. Sometimes, it might give more false positive and false negative results than the desired rates. Therefore, to assist the traditional RT-PCR methodology for accurate clinical diagnosis, COVID-19 screening can be adopted with X-Ray and CT scan images of lung of an individual. This image based diagnosis will bring radical change in detecting coronavirus infection in human body with ease and having zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates. This paper reports a convolutional neural network (CNN) based multi-image augmentation technique for detecting COVID-19 in chest X-Ray and chest CT scan images of coronavirus suspected individuals. Multi-image augmentation makes use of discontinuity information obtained in the filtered images for increasing the number of effective examples for training the CNN model. With this approach, the proposed model exhibits higher classification accuracy around 95.38% and 98.97% for CT scan and X-Ray images respectively. CT scan images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 94.78% and specificity of 95.98%, whereas X-Ray images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 99.07% and specificity of 98.88%. Evaluation has been done on publicly available databases containing both chest X-Ray and CT scan images and the experimental results are also compared with ResNet-50 and VGG-16 models.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kiran Purohit","author_inst":"NIT Durgapur"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Kesarwani","author_inst":"NIT Durgapur"},{"author_name":"Dakshina Ranjan Kisku","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Durgapur"},{"author_name":"Mamata Dalui","author_inst":"NIT Durgapur"},{"author_name":"Daniela Schmid","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Stephan W Aberle","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Benedikt Agerer","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alexander Lercher","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lukas Endler","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Veterinary Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henrique Colaco","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mark Smyth","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Michael Schuster","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miguel Grau","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Francisco Martinez Jimenez","author_inst":"IRB"},{"author_name":"Oriol Pich","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Wegene Tamire Borena","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Medical University Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Erich Pawelka","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zsofia Keszei","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Senekowitsch","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jan Laine","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberle","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Monika Redlberger-Fritz","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Mario Karolyi","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zoufaly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sabine Maritschnik","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Martin Borkovec","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Peter Hufnagl","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Manfred Nairz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Guenter Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Michael T.

Furthermore, with its increasing incidence, more has been learned about the risk factors that can make certain groups more at risk of contracting the disease or have worse outcomes. We aim to identify any discrepancy in the hospitalization rate by race\/ethnicity of patients who tested positive for COVID-19, and through this, analyze the risks of these groups in an effort to call out for attention to the circumstances that make them more vulnerable and susceptible to disease. Observations: Analysis indicates that patients identified as non-Hispanic White and Asian\/Pacific Islander in hospital admission data are underrepresented in COVID-19 admissions. Patients identified as non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic\/Latino, and American Indian have a disproportionate burden of hospital admissions, suggesting an increased risk of more severe disease. Conclusions and Relevance: There is a disproportionate rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations found among non-Hispanic Blacks. Further investigation is imperative to identify and remediate the reason(s) for increased vulnerability to COVID-19 infections requiring hospital admission. These efforts would likely reduce the COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the non-Hispanic Black population.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Violeta Alvarez Retamales","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield IL"},{"author_name":"Oswaldo Madrid Suarez","author_inst":"Universidad Central de Venezuela, Luis Razetti School of Medicine.

Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients. Methods Blood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symtom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28\/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR 19.6-42.4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0.41, p < 0.05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF. Conclusions These data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phases.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Quan-Xin Long","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Jun Deng","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-Zhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gui-Ji Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chang-Long He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lu-Yi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie-Li Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ai-Long Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miguel Grau","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Francisco Martinez Jimenez","author_inst":"IRB"},{"author_name":"Oriol Pich","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Wegene Tamire Borena","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Medical University Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Erich Pawelka","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zsofia Keszei","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Senekowitsch","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jan Laine","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberle","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Monika Redlberger-Fritz","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Mario Karolyi","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zoufaly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sabine Maritschnik","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Martin Borkovec","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Peter Hufnagl","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Manfred Nairz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Guenter Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Michael T.

Using the per capita number of new cases as a proxy for the abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the number of deaths as a measure of virulence, the dynamics of the pandemic and the outcomes emerging from it are examined for three locations (England, Italy and New York State). The data are analysed with a new version of a population dynamics model that combines exponential\/logistic growth with time-varying carrying capacity, allowing predictions of persistence or extinction of the virus. In agreement with coevolutionary theory, the model suggests a transition from exponential virus growth to low abundance, coupled with reduced virulence, during colonisation of the alternate human host. The structure of the model allows a straightforward assessment of key parameters, which can be contrasted with standard epidemiological models and interpreted with respect to ecological and evolutionary processes and isolation policies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Gillman","author_inst":"University of Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Nuno Crokidakis","author_inst":"Universidade Federal Fluminense"},{"author_name":"Hai-Jun Deng","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-Zhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gui-Ji Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chang-Long He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lu-Yi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie-Li Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ai-Long Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miguel Grau","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Francisco Martinez Jimenez","author_inst":"IRB"},{"author_name":"Oriol Pich","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Wegene Tamire Borena","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Medical University Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Erich Pawelka","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zsofia Keszei","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Senekowitsch","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jan Laine","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberle","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Monika Redlberger-Fritz","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Mario Karolyi","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zoufaly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sabine Maritschnik","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Martin Borkovec","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Peter Hufnagl","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Manfred Nairz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Guenter Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Michael T.

Alteration of the microbiome was divergent between the respiratory tract and gut, albeit the dysbiosis was dominated by genus Pseudomonas and sustained for up to 25-58 days in different individuals. The respiratory microbiome distortion persisted in 7\/8 children for at least 19-24 days after discharge from the hospital.

COVID-19 seroprevalence data has been scarce, especially in less developed countries with a relatively low infection rate. METHODS. A locally developed rapid IgM\/IgG test kit was used for screening hospital staff in Ranong hospital which located in a province with zero COVID-19 prevalence in Thailand from April 17 to May 17, 2020. A total of 844 participants were tested; 82 of which were tested twice with one month apart. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002) RESULTS. Overall, 0.8% of the participants (7 of 844) had positive immunoglobulin M (IgM), none had positive immunoglobulin G (IgG). Female staffs seemed to have higher IgM seropositive than male staffs (1.0% vs. 0.5%). None of the participants with a history of travel to the high-risk area or a history of close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case had developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among 844 staff, 811 had no symptom and six of them developed IgM seropositive (0.7%) while 33 had minor symptoms and only one of them developed IgM seropositive (3.0%). No association between IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2 status and gender, history of travel to a high-risk area, history of close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case, history of close contact with suspected COVID-19 case, presence of symptoms within 14 days, or previous PCR status was found. None of the hospital staff developed IgG against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION. COVID-19 antibody test could detect a substantial number of hospital staffs who could be potential silent spreaders in a province with zero COVID-19 case. Antibody testing should be encouraged for mass screening, especially in asymptomatic healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tanawin Nopsopon","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Krit Pongpirul","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Korn Chotirosniramit","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wutichai Jakaew","author_inst":"Ranong Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chuenkhwan Kaewwijit","author_inst":"Ranong Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sawan Kanchana","author_inst":"Ranong Hospital"},{"author_name":"Narin Hiransuthikul","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jin Xu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Chiyu Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ai-Long Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miguel Grau","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Francisco Martinez Jimenez","author_inst":"IRB"},{"author_name":"Oriol Pich","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Wegene Tamire Borena","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Medical University Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Erich Pawelka","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zsofia Keszei","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Senekowitsch","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jan Laine","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberle","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Monika Redlberger-Fritz","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Mario Karolyi","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zoufaly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sabine Maritschnik","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Martin Borkovec","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Peter Hufnagl","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Manfred Nairz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Guenter Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Michael T.

All but one of these introductions came from non-Chinese sources, suggesting that border closure with China has helped delay establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in Russia. These introductions resulted in at least 9 distinct Russian lineages corresponding to domestic transmission. A notable transmission cluster corresponded to a nosocomial outbreak at the Vreden hospital in Saint Petersburg; phylodynamic analysis of this cluster reveals multiple (2-4) introductions each giving rise to a large number of cases, with a high initial effective reproduction number of 3.7 (2.5-5.0).","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrey B Komissarov","author_inst":"Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza, Russia"},{"author_name":"Ksenia R Safina","author_inst":"Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Russia"},{"author_name":"Sofya K Garushyants","author_inst":"A.A.

The aim of this work is to estimate the true number of SARS-CoV-2 (detected and undetected) infections in several European Countries. The question being asked is: How many cases have actually occurred? Methods: We propose an upper bound estimator under cumulative data distributions, in an open population, based on a day-wise estimator that allows for heterogeneity. The estimator is data-driven and can be easily computed from the distributions of daily cases and deaths. Uncertainty surrounding the estimates is obtained using bootstrap methods. Results: We focus on the ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases at April 17th. Differences arise at the Country level, and we get estimates ranging from the 3.93 times of Norway to the 7.94 times of France. Accurate estimates are obtained, as bootstrap based intervals are rather narrow. Conclusions: Many parametric or semi-parametric models have been developed to estimate the population size from aggregated counts leading to an approximation of the missed population and\/or to the estimate of the threshold under which the number of missed people cannot fall (i.e. a lower bound). Here, we provide a methodological contribution introducing an upper bound estimator and provide reliable estimates on the dark number, i.e. how many undetected cases are going around for several European Countries, where the epidemic spreads differently.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Irene Rocchetti","author_inst":"Statistical Office"},{"author_name":"Dankmar Boehning","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Heinz Holling","author_inst":"University of Muenster"},{"author_name":"Antonello Maruotti","author_inst":"Libera Universit\u00e0 Ss Maria Assunta"},{"author_name":"Chandra Mohan","author_inst":"Government of Tamil Nadu, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"S Neelima","author_inst":"Guntur Medical College, Andhra Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"K.

Results Median age was 3.9 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.3-12.9 years], 36% (162\/451) were under 12 months old, and 57% (256\/450) were male. 56% (224\/401) were White, 12% (49\/401) South Asian and 10% (40\/401) Black. 43% (195\/451) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A muco-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, closely mirroring the WHO MIS-C criteria. 17% of children (72\/431) were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis this was associated with age under one month odds ratio 5.05 (95% confidence interval 1.69 to 15.72, p=0.004), age 10 to 14 years OR 3.11 (1.21 to 8.55, p=0.022) and Black ethnicity OR 3.02 (1.30 to 6.84, p=0.008). Three young people died (0.7 %, 3\/451) aged 16 to 19 years, all of whom had profound comorbidity. Twelve percent of children (36\/303) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Those meeting MIS-C criteria were older, (median age 10.8 years ([IQR 8.4-14.1] vs 2.0 [0.2-12.6]), p<0.001) and more likely to be of non-White ethnicity (70% (23\/33) vs 43% (101\/237), p=0.005). Children with MIS-C were four times more likely to be admitted to critical care (61% (22\/36) vs 15% (40\/267, p<0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with headache (45% (13\/29) vs 11% (19\/171), p<0.001), myalgia (39% (11\/28) vs 7% (12\/170), p<0.001), sore throat (37% (10\/27) vs (13% (24\/183, p = 0.004) and fatigue (57% (17\/30) vs 31% (60\/192), p =0.012) than children who did not and to have a platelet count of less than 150 x109\/L (30% (10\/33) vs 10% (24\/232), p=0.004). Conclusions Our data confirms less severe covid-19 in children and young people than in adults and we provide additional evidence for refining the MIS-C case definition. The identification of a muco-enteric symptom cluster also raises the suggestion that MIS-C is the severe end of a spectrum of disease.

Objectives: To assess outcomes following COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those without in a contemporaneous age, sex and comorbidity matched population. Methods: An international multicentre audit of patients with a prior diagnosis of ILD admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 1 May 2020 was undertaken and compared with patients, without ILD obtained from the ISARIC 4C cohort, admitted with COVID-19 over the same period. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary analysis distinguished IPF from non-IPF ILD and used lung function to determine the greatest risks of death. Measurements and Main Results: Data from 349 patients with ILD across Europe were included, of whom 161 were admitted to hospital with laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID-19 and eligible for propensity-score matching. Overall mortality was 49% (79\/161) in patients with ILD with COVID-19. After matching ILD patients with COVID-19 had higher mortality (HR 1.60, Confidence Intervals 1.17-2.18 p=0.003) compared with age, sex and co-morbidity matched controls without ILD. Patients with a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of <80% had an increased risk of death versus patients with FVC [&ge;]80% (HR 1.72, 1.05-2.83). Furthermore, obese patients with ILD had an elevated risk of death (HR 1.98, 1.13-3.46). Conclusions: Patients with ILD are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, particularly those with poor lung function and obesity. Stringent precautions should be taken to avoid COVID-19 in patients with ILD.","rel_num_authors":70,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gisli Jenkins","author_inst":"University of

Here, we show results from the first in-human trials using non-invasive ultrasound stimulation of the spleen to reduce cytokine release in the context of both an acute response in healthy subjects and a chronic inflammatory condition in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Splenic ultrasound results in a reduction in TNF serum levels, as well as IL-1B; and IL-8 transcript levels in monocytes. There is also a down regulation of pathways involved in TNF and IL-6 production, and IFNgamma- and NFKB-regulated genes. Many of these cytokines or pathways are upregulated in COVID-19 patients. There is also a reduction in chemokine transcript levels and other components of the chemotactic response, suggesting that reduction of cellular migration may contribute to the therapeutic effects of ultrasound. There is no inhibition of the adaptive immune response with ultrasound treatment relating to antibody production. This is consistent with a pre-clinical animal model where enhanced antibody production was achieved with splenic ultrasound. Therefore, this new splenic ultrasound approach has the potential to treat acute and chronic hyper-inflammatory diseases, as it lowers cytokine levels without disrupting the normal adaptive immune response. Portable ultrasound technologies are currently being developed and translated to the clinic to treat various inflammatory disorders, with more recent efforts directed towards combatting the hyperinflammation or cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel Stegeman Graham","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Daniel P Zachs","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Victoria Cotero","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Catherine DAgostino","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Despoina Ntiloudi","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Claire RW Kaiser","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"John Graf","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Kirk Wallace","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Coleman","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research,"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Ashe","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"John Pellerito","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kevin J Tracey","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Bryce Binstadt","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta S Chavan","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stavros Zanos","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Puleo","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Erik Peterson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Hubert H Lim","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Louise Crowley","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Davinder Dosanjh","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Christine Fiddler","author_inst":"Cambridge Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0AY, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian A Forrest","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4LP, UK."},{"author_name":"Peter George","author_inst":"Royal Brompton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Gibbons","author_inst":"South West Peninsula ILD Network, Royal Devon & Exeter Foundation NHS Trust Barrack Road, Exeter EX2 5DW, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Groom","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London W12 0HS, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Haney","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Simon Hart","author_inst":"Respiratory Research Group, Hull York Medical School, Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, UK, HU16 5JQ"},{"author_name":"Emily Heiden","author_inst":"University Hospitals Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Henry","author_inst":"Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ling-Pei Ho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hoyles","author_inst":"Oxford Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Killian Hurley","author_inst":"Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Mark Jones","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre & Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Jones","author_inst":"Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis"},{"author_name":"Maria Kokosi","author_inst":"Guys and St Thomas' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Kreuter","author_inst":"Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Pneumology, Thoraxklinik, University of Heidelberg, Germany and German Center for Lung Research, 69126 Heidelber"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Method: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the North Memorial Health Hospital, Robbinsdale, MN, USA Results: Three patients (two men and one woman, aged 38 - 63) presented with fatigue, cough and fever leading to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 infection requiring intubation and ventilatory support. Two patients were unresponsive, one with strong eye deviation to the left and the third patient had severe diffuse weakness. MRI in all patients showed findings consistent with ADEM. CSF showed elevated protein in all patients with normal cell count and no evidence of infection, including negative COVID-19 PCR. All three of the patients received Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19. All patients were treated with intravenous corticosteroids and improved, although two responded minimally. Two patients treated with IVIG showed no further improvement. Conclusion: Neurological complications from COVID-19 are being rapidly recognized. Our three cases highlight the occurrence of ADEM as a postinfectious\/immune mediated complication of COVID-19 infection, which may be responsive to corticosteroid treatment. Early recognition of this complication and treatment is important to avoid long term complications.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michaela McCuddy","author_inst":"Department of Family Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Praful Kelkar","author_inst":"Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhao","author_inst":"Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology"},{"author_name":"David Wicklund","author_inst":"Minneapolis Radiology"},{"author_name":"Despoina Ntiloudi","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Claire RW Kaiser","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"John Graf","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Kirk Wallace","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Coleman","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research,"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Ashe","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"John Pellerito","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kevin J Tracey","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Bryce Binstadt","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta S Chavan","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stavros Zanos","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Puleo","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Erik Peterson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Hubert H Lim","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Louise Crowley","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Davinder Dosanjh","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Christine Fiddler","author_inst":"Cambridge Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0AY, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian A Forrest","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4LP, UK."},{"author_name":"Peter George","author_inst":"Royal Brompton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Gibbons","author_inst":"South West Peninsula ILD Network, Royal Devon & Exeter Foundation NHS Trust Barrack Road, Exeter EX2 5DW, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Groom","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London W12 0HS, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Haney","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Simon Hart","author_inst":"Respiratory Research Group, Hull York Medical School, Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, UK, HU16 5JQ"},{"author_name":"Emily Heiden","author_inst":"University Hospitals Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Henry","author_inst":"Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ling-Pei Ho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hoyles","author_inst":"Oxford Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Killian Hurley","author_inst":"Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Mark Jones","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre & Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Jones","author_inst":"Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis"},{"author_name":"Maria Kokosi","author_inst":"Guys and St Thomas' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Kreuter","author_inst":"Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Pneumology, Thoraxklinik, University of Heidelberg, Germany and German Center for Lung Research, 69126 Heidelber"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Classified as essential, such workers cannot shelter at home. Therefore, knowledge and preventive behaviors are important to reduce COVID-19 spread in the community. (2) Methods: Respondents for 67 families with at least one farmworker (FWF) and 38 comparable families with no farmworkers (non-FWF) in North Carolina completed a telephone survey in May, 2020. The survey queried knowledge of COVID-19, perceptions of its severity, self-efficacy, and preventive behaviors. Detailed data were collected to document household members' social interaction and use of face coverings. (3) Results: Knowledge of COVID-19 and prevention methods was high in both groups, as was its perceived severity. Non-FWF had higher self-efficacy for preventing infection. Both groups claimed to practice preventive behaviors, though FWF emphasized social avoidance and non-FWF emphasized personal hygiene. Detailed social interactions showed high rates of inter-personal contact at home, at work, and in the community with more mask use in non-FWF than FWF. (4) Conclusions: Despite high levels of knowledge and perceived severity for COVID-19, these immigrant families were engaged in frequent interpersonal contact that could expose community members and themselves to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara A.

The world average for the coefficient that linearises the level of transmission with respect to the OxCGRT stringency index is s= 0.01{+\/-}0.0017 (95%C.I.). The corresponding South African coefficient is s= 0.0078{+\/-}0.00036 (95%C.I.), compatible with the world average. Here, we implement the stringency index for the recently announced 5-tier regulatory alert system. Predictions are made for the spread of the virus for each alert level. Assuming constant rates of recovery and mortality, it is essential to increase s. For the system to remain sub-critical, the rate with which s increases should outpace that of the decrease of the stringency index. Monitoring of s becomes essential to controlling the post-lockdown phase. Data from the Gauteng province obtained in May 2020 has been used to re-calibrate the model, where s was found increase by 20% with respect to the period before lockdown. Predictions for the province are made in this light.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Finn D Stevenson","author_inst":"University of Witwaterstrand"},{"author_name":"Bruce Mellado","author_inst":"University of Witwaterstrand"},{"author_name":"Joshua Choma","author_inst":"University of Witwaterstrand"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Lieberman","author_inst":"University of Witwaterstrand"},{"author_name":"F\u00e1bio Corr\u00eaa","author_inst":"Rhodes University"},{"author_name":"Salah-Eddine Dahbi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Hayashi","author_inst":"University of Witwaterstrand"},{"author_name":"Kgomotso Monnakgotla","author_inst":"University of Witwaterstrand"},{"author_name":"Jacques Naude","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Ruan","author_inst":"University of Witwaterstrand"},{"author_name":"Caroline Maslo","author_inst":"Netcare Hospital Division"},{"author_name":"Kevin J Tracey","author_inst":"Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Bryce Binstadt","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta S Chavan","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stavros Zanos","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Puleo","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Erik Peterson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Hubert H Lim","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Louise Crowley","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Davinder Dosanjh","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Christine Fiddler","author_inst":"Cambridge Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0AY, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian A Forrest","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4LP, UK."},{"author_name":"Peter George","author_inst":"Royal Brompton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Gibbons","author_inst":"South West Peninsula ILD Network, Royal Devon & Exeter Foundation NHS Trust Barrack Road, Exeter EX2 5DW, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Groom","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London W12 0HS, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Haney","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Simon Hart","author_inst":"Respiratory Research Group, Hull York Medical School, Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, UK, HU16 5JQ"},{"author_name":"Emily Heiden","author_inst":"University Hospitals Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Henry","author_inst":"Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ling-Pei Ho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hoyles","author_inst":"Oxford Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Killian Hurley","author_inst":"Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Mark Jones","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre & Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Jones","author_inst":"Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis"},{"author_name":"Maria Kokosi","author_inst":"Guys and St Thomas' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Kreuter","author_inst":"Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Pneumology, Thoraxklinik, University of Heidelberg, Germany and German Center for Lung Research, 69126 Heidelber"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

We therefore performed a SARS-CoV-2 seropraevalence-study in students and teachers to assess their role in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methods: Students grade 8-11 and their teachers in 13 secondary schools in eastern Saxony, Germany, were invited to participate in the SchoolCoviDD19 study. Blood samples were collected between May 25th and June 30th, 2020. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were assed using chemiluminescence immunoassay technology and all samples with a positive or equivocal test result were re-tested with two additional serological tests. Findings: 1538 students and 507 teachers participated in this study. The seropraevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 0.6%. Even in schools with reported Covid-19 cases before the Lockdown of March 13th no clusters could be identified. 23\/24 participants with a household history of COVID-91 were seronegative. By using a combination of three different immunoassays we could exclude 16 participants with a positive or equivocal results after initial testing. Interpretation: Students and teachers do not play a crucial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a low prevalence setting. Transmission in families occurs very infrequently, and the number of unreported cases is low in this age group, making school closures not appear appropriate as a strategy in this low prevalence settings.

High number of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are available in different formats, detect different types of antibodies, and use different target proteins. Sensitivity of these tests varies and could be also related to clinical symptoms and testing time. Methods. Serum samples from 97 COVID-19 patients and 100 controls were tested with 9 antibody tests (SNIBE, Epitope, Euroimmun, Roche, Abbott, DiaSorin, Biosensor, LIPS N, and LIPS S-RBD). The results were analyzed in context of clinical data. Findings. Positivity rate was of tests was following: N-LIPS test (91.8% cases), Epitope (85.6%), Abbott and in-house LIPS S-RBD (both 84.5%), Roche (83.5%), Euroimmun (82.5%), DiaSorin (81.4%), SNIBE (70.1%), and Biosensor (64.9%). Agreement between tests varied (71-95%). Correlation between patient symptoms score and antibody value was test-dependent: varied from strongest in LIPS N (rho=0.41; p<0.001) to nonsignificant (LIPS S-RBD). Testing time from symptoms influenced sensitivity in some tests more than anothers. Interpretation. Sensitivity of tests varied highly and combination of different tests may improve it. Relation of results to symptoms and testing time was test-dependent. Thus, some antibody tests seems to be more sensitive to detect antibodies early and in asymptomatic patients than others. Funding.

However, in spite of extensive discussions, very few places have even attempted to implement it. We evaluated the efficacy of widespread testing in creating a safe workplace in our healthcare community including staff and patients. Furthermore, we assessed the rate of new infections in patients undergoing electrophysiology (EP) procedure, to see if identification and exclusion of positive cases facilitated establishment of a risk-free operating environment. Methods: Universal testing was conducted in subjects with no symptoms of COVID-19 including patients and their caregivers and staff in our electrophysiology units along with the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) staff (n=1670) Results: Of 1670, 758 (45.4%) were EP patients, and the remaining 912 were caregivers, EMS staff and hospital staff from EP clinic and lab. Viral-RNA test revealed 64 (3.8%) positives in the population. A significant increase in the rate of positives was observed from April to June, 2020 (p=0.02). Procedures of positive cases (n=31) were postponed until they tested negative at retesting on day 14. Staff testing positive (n=33) were retested before going back to work after 2 weeks. Because of suspected exposure, 67 staff were retested and source was traced. No new infections were reported in patients during the hospital stay or within 2-weeks after the procedure. Conclusion: Universal testing to identify positive cases was helpful in creating and maintaining a safe working environment without exposing patients and staff to new infections in the EP unit at the hospital.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanghamitra Mohanty","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy","author_inst":"Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute"},{"author_name":"Chintan Trivedi","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Bryan MacDonald","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Angel Mayedo","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Domenico G Della Rocca","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Gopinathannair","author_inst":"Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute"},{"author_name":"Gerald J Gallinghouse","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Luigi Di Biase","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Rodney Horton","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Robert Canby","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute"},{"author_name":"Andrea Natale","author_inst":"Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute, St."},{"author_name":"Bryce Binstadt","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Sangeeta S Chavan","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stavros Zanos","author_inst":"North Shore University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Puleo","author_inst":"General Electric Research"},{"author_name":"Erik Peterson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Hubert H Lim","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Louise Crowley","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Davinder Dosanjh","author_inst":"Birmingham Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Christine Fiddler","author_inst":"Cambridge Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0AY, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian A Forrest","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4LP, UK."},{"author_name":"Peter George","author_inst":"Royal Brompton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Gibbons","author_inst":"South West Peninsula ILD Network, Royal Devon & Exeter Foundation NHS Trust Barrack Road, Exeter EX2 5DW, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Groom","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London W12 0HS, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Haney","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Simon Hart","author_inst":"Respiratory Research Group, Hull York Medical School, Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, UK, HU16 5JQ"},{"author_name":"Emily Heiden","author_inst":"University Hospitals Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Henry","author_inst":"Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ling-Pei Ho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hoyles","author_inst":"Oxford Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Killian Hurley","author_inst":"Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Mark Jones","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre & Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Jones","author_inst":"Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis"},{"author_name":"Maria Kokosi","author_inst":"Guys and St Thomas' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Kreuter","author_inst":"Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Pneumology, Thoraxklinik, University of Heidelberg, Germany and German Center for Lung Research, 69126 Heidelber"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Design: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D for ARI prevention using a random effects model. Pre-specified sub-group analyses were done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration or dosing regimen. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Standard RCT Number (ISRCTN) registry from inception to May 2020. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies: Double-blind RCTs of supplementation with vitamin D or calcidiol, of any duration, were eligible if they were approved by a Research Ethics Committee and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and pre-specified as an efficacy outcome. Results: We identified 40 eligible RCTs (total 30,956 participants, aged 0 to 95 years). Data were obtained for 29,841 (96.5%) of 30,909 participants in 39 studies. For the primary comparison of vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo, the intervention reduced risk of ARI overall (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98; P for heterogeneity 0.009). No statistically significant effect of vitamin D was seen for any of the sub-groups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration. However, protective effects were seen for trials in which vitamin D was given using a daily dosing regimen (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93); at daily dose equivalents of 400-1000 IU (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89); and for a duration of [&le;]12 months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08). Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed as being low for all but two trials. A funnel plot showed asymmetry, suggesting that small trials showing non-protective effects of vitamin D may have been omitted from the meta-analysis. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation was safe and reduced risk of ARI, despite evidence of significant heterogeneity across trials. The overall effect size may have been over-estimated due to publication bias. Protection was associated with administration of daily doses of 400-1000 IU vitamin D for up to 12 months. The relevance of these findings to COVID-19 is not known and requires investigation.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Jolliffe","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Camargo Jr.","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"John Sluyter","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Mary Aglipay","author_inst":"St Michael's Hospital, Toronto"},{"author_name":"John Aloia","author_inst":"Winthrop University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter Bergman","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Camilla Damsgaard","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Gal Dubnov-Raz","author_inst":"Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Susanna Esposito","author_inst":"University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Davaasambuu Ganmaa","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Clare Gilham","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adit Ginde","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Cameron Grant","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Chris Griffiths","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Hibbs","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wim Janssens","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Anuradha Vaman Khadilkar","author_inst":"Hirabai Cowasji Jehangir Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ilkka Laaksi","author_inst":"University of Tampere"},{"author_name":"Margaret T Lee","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mark Loeb","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Jonathon Maguire","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"David T Mauger","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Pawel Majak","author_inst":"University of Lodz"},{"author_name":"Semira Manaseki-Holland","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"David Murdoch","author_inst":"University of Otago"},{"author_name":"Akio Nakashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachel E Neale","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Christine Rake","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Judith Rees","author_inst":"Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth"},{"author_name":"Jenni Rosendahl","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Robert Scragg","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Shah","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Shimizu","author_inst":"FANCL Corporation, Yokohama"},{"author_name":"Steve Simpson-Yap","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Geeta Trilok Kumar","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitsuyoshi Urashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adrian R Martineau","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

We quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load from participants with a diverse range of COVID-19 severity, including those requiring hospitalization, outpatients with mild disease, and individuals with resolved infection. SARS-CoV-2 plasma RNA was detected in 27% of hospitalized participants and 13% of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Amongst the participants hospitalized with COVID-19, higher prevalence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load was associated with worse respiratory disease severity, lower absolute lymphocyte counts, and increased markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially plasma viremia, were associated with increased risk of mortality. SARS-CoV-2 viral load may aid in the risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 and its role in disease pathogenesis should be further explored.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesse M Fajnzylber","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"James Regan","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Kendyll Coxen","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Heather Corry","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Colline Wong","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Rosenthal","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Daniel Worrall","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Francoise Giguel","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Alicja Piechocka-Trocha","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Fischinger","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Andrew Chan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Keith T Flaherty","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Hall","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Michael Dougan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Edward T Ryan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gillespie","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rida Chishti","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Yijia Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Jilg","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Dusan Hanidziar","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rebecca M Baron","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Baden","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Athe M Tsibris","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Katrina A Armstrong","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Kuritzkes","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Bruce D Walker","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Howard"},{"author_name":"Xu Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"- Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Shah","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Shimizu","author_inst":"FANCL Corporation, Yokohama"},{"author_name":"Steve Simpson-Yap","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Geeta Trilok Kumar","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitsuyoshi Urashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adrian R Martineau","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

This study aims to evaluate public's perceived importance of the NPIs imposed for COVID-19 control in personal and public health protection in Greece. Methods: This cross-sectional online study, enrolled 657 adult participants from the general Greek population in order to assess their beliefs and evaluate possible factors that influence their perceptions as regards NPI importance in personal and public health protection. Results: Overall, Greeks considered NPIs important for health protection. The participants who were less likely to consider NPIs important were men (OR versus females=1.64, 95% CI:1.15 to 2.36, p=0.007), people younger than 40 years old (OR between ages over 40 versus ages below 40=0.48, 95% CI:0.34 to 0.68, p<0.001), and people who did not chose the Hellenic National Public Health Organization (EODY) to get informed about COVID-19 (OR of EODY versus other sources of information = 0.65, 95% CI:0.46-0.92, p= 0.014). Conclusions: This study profiled Greek people who do and do not consider NPIs important, mainly as of their demographic features. Focused communicational strategies in certain population subgroups are recommended.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eleni C.

We aimed to assess whether the newly created models reproduce the full spectrum of humans COVID-19. Methods: We searched the Medline, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research published in English from January 1, to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND, animal models, hamsters, nonhuman primates, macaques, rodent, mice, rats, ferrets, rabbits, cats, and dogs. Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal models of COVID-19. Findings: 13 peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met inclusion criteria. The animals used were nonhuman primates (n=13), mice (n=7), ferrets (n =4), hamsters (n= 4), and cats (n =1). All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology and full recovery. Older animals displayed relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in Rhesus macaques, hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled cytokine storm or coagulopathy. Conclusions: Most of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild pattern of human COVID-19 with full recovery phenotype. No severe illness associated with mortality was observed, suggesting a wide gap between COVID-19 in humans and animal models.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Salleh N Ehaideb","author_inst":"Experimental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center\/King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdulaziz Med"},{"author_name":"Mashan L Abdullah","author_inst":"Experimental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center\/King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdulaziz Med"},{"author_name":"Bisher Abuyassin","author_inst":"Experimental Medicine Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center\/King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdulaziz Med"},{"author_name":"Abderrezak Bouchama","author_inst":"King Abdullah International Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Nikolovienis","author_inst":"University of West Attica"},{"author_name":"Despina Kardara","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Chrissoula C.

In the absence of effective treatments or a vaccine, peace of mind will come only with community-based SARS-CoV-2 screening, where many people are tested on a regular basis. However, recent models show that short sample-to-answer turnaround time will be a critical property of effective screening strategies (Larremore et al., 2020). Here, we describe an RT-LAMP test for SARS-CoV-2 in raw saliva that takes about 45 minutes from sample to answer and requires only simple equipment (pipettes and a heating source). The assay has a limit of detection of 100 virions per microliter, and targets two separate regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. By combining rapid sample-to-answer turnaround time with the use of saliva, our RT-LAMP assay provides a low-complexity, portable, and robust system for real-time community screening.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas R.

These diseases include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. With the current (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, it is critical to delineate appropriate contextual respiratory protection for HCWs. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) as part of respiratory protection versus another device (egN95\/FFP2) on HCW infection rates and contamination. Methods Our primary outcomes included HCW infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Ebola or MERS when utilizing PAPR. We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently screened all citations, full-text articles, and abstracted data. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Where applicable, we constructed Evidence Profile (EP) tables for each individual outcome. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each outcome was classified according to the GRADE system. Results We identified 689 studies during literature searches. We included 10 full text studies. A narrative synthesis was provided. Two on-field studies reported no difference in the rates of healthcare workers performing airway procedures during care of critical patients with SARS-CoV-2. A single simulation trial reported a lower level of cross-contamination of participants using PAPR compared to alternative respiratory protection. There is moderate quality evidence that PAPR use is associated with greater heat tolerance but lower scores for mobility and communication ability. We identified a trend toward greater self-reported wearer comfort with PAPR technology in low quality observational simulation studies. Conclusion Field observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment. Greater heat tolerance accompanied by lower scores of mobility and audibility in PAPR were identified . Further pragmatic studies are needed in order to delineate actual effectiveness and provider satisfaction with PAPR technology. Please note: Protocol for this review was prospectively registered with the International Register of Systematic Reviews identification number CRD42020184724.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Licina","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Silvers","author_inst":"Monash Health"},{"author_name":"Rhonda Stuart","author_inst":"Monash Health"},{"author_name":"Camille L.

Detailed hospital-level information on patient characteristics, outcomes and capacity strain are currently scarce but would guide clinical decision-making and inform prioritisation and planning. Methods We aimed to determine factors associated with hospital mortality and describe hospital and ICU strain by conducting a prospective cohort study at a tertiary academic centre in London, UK. We included adult patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and followed them up until hospital discharge or 30 days. Baseline factors that are associated with hospital mortality were identified via semi-parametric and parametric survival analyses. Results Our study included 429 patients; 18% of them were admitted to ICU, 52% met criteria for ICU outreach team activation and 61% had treatment limitations placed during their admission. Hospital mortality was 26% and ICU mortality was 34%. Hospital mortality was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, history of chronic kidney disease, increasing baseline C-reactive protein level and dyspnoea at presentation. COVID-19 resulted in substantial ICU and hospital strain, with up to 9 daily ICU admissions and 41 daily hospital admissions, to a peak census of 80 infected patients admitted in ICU and 250 in the hospital. Management of such a surge required extensive reorganisation of critical care services with expansion of ICU capacity from 69 to 129 beds, redeployment of staff from other hospital areas and coordinated hospital-level effort. Conclusions COVID-19 is associated with a high burden of mortality for patients treated on the ward and the ICU and required substantial reconfiguration of critical care services. This has significant implications for planning and resource utilization.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Savvas Vlachos","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Adrian Wong","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Victoria Metaxa","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sergio Canestrini","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Carmen Lopez Soto","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jimstan Periselneris","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kai Lee","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tanya Patrick","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Christopher Stovin","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Katrina Abernethy","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Budoor Albudoor","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rishi Banerjee","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fatimah Juma","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sara Al-Hashimi","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ritesh Maharaj","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gillespie","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rida Chishti","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Yijia Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Jilg","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Dusan Hanidziar","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rebecca M Baron","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Baden","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Athe M Tsibris","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Katrina A Armstrong","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Kuritzkes","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Bruce D Walker","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Howard"},{"author_name":"Xu Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"- Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Shah","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Shimizu","author_inst":"FANCL Corporation, Yokohama"},{"author_name":"Steve Simpson-Yap","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Geeta Trilok Kumar","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitsuyoshi Urashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adrian R Martineau","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Both cough and sneeze based droplets or aerosols encapsulated COVID-19 particles are responsible for air borne transmission of this virus and caused unexpected escalation and high mortality worldwide. Current study intends to investigate correlation of COVID-19 epidemic with meteorological parameters particularly, temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed along with population size. Data set of COVID-19 for highly infected cities of Pakistan was collected from the official website of National Institute of health (NIH). Spearman rank (rs) correlation coefficient test employed for data analysis revealed significant correlation between temperature minimum (TM), temperature average (TA), wind speed (WS) and population size (PS) with COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to analyze the sensitivity of TA, WS, and PS on transmission rate of COVID-19 in selected cities of Pakistan. The results obtained for sensitivity and specificity analysis for all selected parameters signifies sensitivity and direct correlation of COVID-19 transmission with temperature variation, WS and PS. Positive correlation and strong association of PS parameter with COVID-19 pandemic suggested need of more strict actions and control measures for highly populated cities. These findings will be helpful for health regulatory authorities and policymakers to take specific measures to combat COVID-19 epidemic in Pakistan.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Iram Shahzadi","author_inst":"College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54000, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Anum Shahzadi","author_inst":"College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54000, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Junaid Haider","author_inst":"Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sadia Naz","author_inst":"Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tianjin 300308, China"},{"author_name":"Rai M Aamir","author_inst":"Institute of Food and Nutritional Sciences, PMAS-Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi, 46300, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ali Haider","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, 54000, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Hafiz Rizwan Sharif","author_inst":"University Institute of Diet and Nutritional Sciences, The University of Lahore, Gujrat campus, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Imran Mahmood Khan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, 214122, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ikram","author_inst":"Government College University Lahore"},{"author_name":"Katrina Abernethy","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Budoor Albudoor","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rishi Banerjee","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fatimah Juma","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sara Al-Hashimi","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ritesh Maharaj","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gillespie","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rida Chishti","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Yijia Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Jilg","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Dusan Hanidziar","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rebecca M Baron","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Baden","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Athe M Tsibris","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Katrina A Armstrong","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Kuritzkes","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Bruce D Walker","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Howard"},{"author_name":"Xu Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"- Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Shah","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Shimizu","author_inst":"FANCL Corporation, Yokohama"},{"author_name":"Steve Simpson-Yap","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Geeta Trilok Kumar","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitsuyoshi Urashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adrian R Martineau","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

METHODS Chest CT scans and X-Ray images collected from different centers and institutions were downloaded and combined together. Images were separated by patient and 66% of the patients were used to develop and train AI image-based classifiers. Then, the AI automated classifiers were evaluated on a separate set of patients (the remaining 33% patients). RESULTS (Chest X-Ray) Five different data sources were combined for a total of N=9,841 patients (1,733 with covid-19, 810 with bacterial tuberculosis and 7,298 healthy patients). The test sample size was N=3,528 patients. The best AI method reached an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for covid-19 detection of 99%, with a detection rate of 96.4% at 1.0% false positive rate. RESULTS (Chest CT scans) Two different data sources were combined for a total of N=363 patients (191 having covid-19 and 172 healthy patients). The test sample size was N=121 patients. The best AI method reached an AUC for covid-19 detection of 90.9%, with a detection rate of 90.6% at 24.6% false positive rate. CONCLUSIONS Computer aided automatic covid-19 detection from chest X-ray images showed promising results to be used as screening tool during the covid-19 outbreak. The developed method may help to manage patients better in case access to PCR testing is not possible or to detect patients with symptoms missed in a first round of PCR testing. The method will be made available online (www.quantuscovid19.org). These results merit further evaluation collecting more images. We hope this study will allow us to start such collaborations.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xavier P Burgos-Artizzu","author_inst":"Transmural Biotech"},{"author_name":"Anum Shahzadi","author_inst":"College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54000, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Junaid Haider","author_inst":"Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sadia Naz","author_inst":"Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tianjin 300308, China"},{"author_name":"Rai M Aamir","author_inst":"Institute of Food and Nutritional Sciences, PMAS-Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi, 46300, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ali Haider","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, 54000, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Hafiz Rizwan Sharif","author_inst":"University Institute of Diet and Nutritional Sciences, The University of Lahore, Gujrat campus, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Imran Mahmood Khan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, 214122, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ikram","author_inst":"Government College University Lahore"},{"author_name":"Katrina Abernethy","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Budoor Albudoor","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rishi Banerjee","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fatimah Juma","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sara Al-Hashimi","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ritesh Maharaj","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gillespie","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rida Chishti","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Yijia Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Jilg","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Dusan Hanidziar","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Rebecca M Baron","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Baden","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Athe M Tsibris","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Katrina A Armstrong","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Kuritzkes","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Bruce D Walker","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and Howard"},{"author_name":"Xu Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"- Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Shah","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Shimizu","author_inst":"FANCL Corporation, Yokohama"},{"author_name":"Steve Simpson-Yap","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Geeta Trilok Kumar","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitsuyoshi Urashima","author_inst":"Jikei University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adrian R Martineau","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Laura Mackay","author_inst":"Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Northumbria Way, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Cramlington, NE23 6NZ"},{"author_name":"Siva Mahendran","author_inst":"Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.
