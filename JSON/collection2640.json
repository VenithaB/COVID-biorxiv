Methods We compared five testing strategies: 1) PCR-severe-only: PCR testing only patients with severe\/critical symptoms; 2) Self-screen: PCR-severe-only plus self-assessment of COVID-19-consistent symptoms with self-isolation if positive; 3) PCR-any-symptom: PCR for any COVID-19-consistent symptoms with self-isolation if positive; 4) PCR-all: PCR-any-symptom and one-time PCR for the entire population; and, 5) PCR-all-repeat: PCR-all with monthly re-testing. We examined effective reproduction numbers (Re, 0.9-2.0) at which policy conclusions would change. We used published data on disease progression and mortality, transmission, PCR sensitivity\/specificity (70\/100%) and costs. Model-projected outcomes included infections, deaths, tests performed, hospital-days, and costs over 180-days, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, $\/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). Results In all scenarios, PCR-all-repeat would lead to the best clinical outcomes and PCR-severe-only would lead to the worst; at Re 0.9, PCR-all-repeat vs. PCR-severe-only resulted in a 63% reduction in infections and a 44% reduction in deaths, but required >65-fold more tests\/day with 4-fold higher costs. PCR-all-repeat had an ICER <$100,000\/QALY only when Re[&ge;]1.8. At all Re values, PCR-any-symptom was cost-saving compared to other strategies. Conclusions Testing people with any COVID-19-consistent symptoms would be cost-saving compared to restricting testing to only those with symptoms severe enough to warrant hospital care. Expanding PCR testing to asymptomatic people would decrease infections, deaths, and hospitalizations. Universal screening would be cost-effective when paired with monthly retesting in settings where the COVID-19 pandemic is surging.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anne M Neilan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elena Losina","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Audrey C.

We find that differences in the age structure of the population and the age-specific prevalence of COVID-19 explain nearly 90% of the geographical variation in population IFR. Consequently, protecting vulnerable age groups could substantially reduce the incidence of mortality.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew T Levin","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"William P.

Risk factors for a severe disease course for young COVID-19 patients and possibly non-linear influences remain unknown. Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, collected retrospectively from Jan 24th to Mar 27th, were analyzed. Clinical, demographic, treatment and laboratory data were collected from patients' medical records. Uni- and multivariable analysis using logistic regression and random forest, with the latter allowing the study of non-linear influences, were performed to investigate and exploit the clinical characteristics of a severe disease course. Results A total of 762 young patients (median age 47 years, interquartile ranges [IQR] 38 - 55, range 16 - 60; 55.9% female) were included, as well as 714 elderly patients as a comparison group. Among the young patients, 362 (47.5%) had a severe\/critical disease course and the mean age was significantly higher in the severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup (59.3 vs. 56.0, Student's t-test: p < 0.001). The uni- and multivariable analysis suggested that several covariates such as elevated levels of ASS, CRP and LDH, and decreased lymphocyte counts are influential on disease severity independent of age. Elevated levels of complement C3 (odds ratio [OR] 15.6, 95% CI 2.41-122.3; p=0.039) are particularly associated with the risk for the development of severity specifically in young patients, where no such influence seems to exist for elderly patients. Additional analysis suggests that the influence of complement C3 in young patients is independent of age, gender, and comorbidities. Variable importance values and partial dependence plots obtained using random forests delivered additional insights, in particular indicating non-linear influences of risk factors on disease severity. Conclusion In young patients with COVID-19, the levels of complement C3 correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weiting Cheng Sr.","author_inst":"Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Roman Hornung","author_inst":"Ludwig-Maximillian-University Munchen Institute of Medical Information, Biometry and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Kai Xu","author_inst":"Tongji hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"Ludwig-Maximilian-Univeristy Munchen Institute of Medical Information, Biometry and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Seamus P.

SARS-CoV-2 follows a highly variable course and it is becoming more evident that individuals immune system has a decisive influence on the progression of the disease. However, the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 mediate disease pathogenesis are largely unknown. Only a few host transcriptional responses in COVID-19 have been reported so far from the Western world, but no such data has been generated from the South-Asian region yet to correlate the conjectured lower fatality around this part of the globe. In this context, we aimed to perform the transcriptomic profiling of the COVID-19 patients from Bangladesh along with the reporting of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from these patients. Moreover, we performed a comparative analysis to demonstrate how differently the various SARS-CoV-2 infection systems are responding to the viral pathogen. We detected a unique missense mutation at 10329 position of ORF1ab gene, annotated to 3C like proteinase, which is found in 75% of our analyzed isolates; but is very rare globally. Upon the functional enrichment analyses of differentially modulated genes, we detected a similar host induced response reported earlier; this response was mainly mediated by the innate immune system, interferon stimulation, and upregulated cytokine expression etc. in the Bangladeshi patients. Surprisingly, we did not perceive the induction of apoptotic signaling, phagosome formation, antigen presentation and production, hypoxia response within these nasopharyngeal samples. Furthermore, while comparing with the other SARS-CoV-2 infection systems, we spotted that lung cells trigger the more versatile immune and cytokine signaling which was several folds higher compared to our reported nasopharyngeal samples. We also observed that lung cells did not express ACE2 in a very high amount as suspected, however, the nasopharyngeal cells are found overexpressing ACE2. But the amount of DPP4 expression within the nasal samples was significantly lower compared to the other cell types. Surprisingly, we observed that lung cells express a very high amount of integrins compared to the nasopharyngeal samples, which might suggest the putative reasons for an increased amount of viral infections in the lungs. From the network analysis, we got clues on the probable viral modulation for the overexpression of these integrins. Our data will provide valuable insights in developing potential studies to elucidate the roles of ethnicity effect on the viral pathogenesis, and incorporation of further data will enrich the search of an effective therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abul B.M.M.K.

Serological assays may improve disease management when appropriately used, for better understanding the antibody responses mounted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and for assessing its real prevalence. Although testing the whole population is impratical, well-designed serosurveys in selected subpopulations in specific risk groups may provide valuable information. Aim: we evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers who underwent molecular testing with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the main hospitals of the Veneto Region by measuring specific antibodies (Abs). Methods: both IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 S-antigen and N-protein were measured using a validated chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) called Maglumi 2000 Plus (New Industries Biomedical EngineeringCo., Ltd [Snibe], Shenzhen, China) Results: A total of 8285 health care workers were tested. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) were detectable in 378 cases (4.6%, 95% CI 4.1-5.0%). Seroconversion was observed in 4.4% women and 5% men, but the difference was not significant. Although detectable antibodies were found in all severe COVID-19 patients (100%), lower seropositivity was found in mild disease (83%) and the lowest prevalence (58%) was observed in asymptomatic subjects. Conclusion: Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance for understanding the rate of population that has already developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The present study has the statistical power to define precisely the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of health workers in our region, with its prevalence (4.6%) reflecting a relatively low circulation. Symptomatic individuals or those hospitalized for medical care were 100% antibody positive, whilst Abs were only detectable in 58% of asymptomatic carriers.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Plebani","author_inst":"University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Andrea Padoan","author_inst":"university of padova"},{"author_name":"Ugo Fedeli","author_inst":"Azienda Zero, regione Veneto"},{"author_name":"Elena Schievano","author_inst":"Azienda Zero, regione Veneto"},{"author_name":"Elena Vecchiato","author_inst":"Azienda Zero, regione veneto"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lippi","author_inst":"Universita di Verona"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Lo Cascio","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Verona"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

Components of such a strategy include individuals tested because they self-select or are recommended for testing by a health care provider for their own health care; individuals tested because they belong to a high-risk group where testing serves to disrupt transmission; and, finally, individuals randomly selected for testing from the university community population as part of a proactive community testing, or surveillance, program. The proactive community testing program is predicated on a mobile device application that asks individuals to self-monitor COVID-like symptoms daily. The goals of this report are (i) to provide a framework for estimating prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the university community wherein proactive community testing is a major component of the overall strategy, (ii) to address the issue of how many tests should be performed as part of the proactive community testing program, and (iii) to consider how effective proactive community testing will be for purposes of detection of new disease clusters. We argue that a comprehensive prevalence estimate informed by all testing done of the university community is a good metric to obtain a global picture of campus SARS-CoV-2 infection rates at a particular point in time and to monitor the dynamics of infection over time, for example, estimating the population-level reproductive number, R0). Importantly, the prevalence metric can be useful to campus leadership for decision making. One example involves comparing campus prevalence to that in the broader off-campus community. We also show that under some reasonable assumptions, we can obtain valid statements about the comprehensive prevalence by only testing symptomatic persons in the proactive community testing component. The number of tests performed for individual-level and high-risk group-level needs will depend on the disease dynamics, individual needs, and testing availability. For purposes of this report, we assume that, for these groups of individuals, inferential precision --- that is, the accuracy with which we can estimate the true prevalence from testing a random sample of individuals --- does not drive decisions on the number of tests. On the other hand, for proactive community testing, the desired level of inferential precision {in a fixed period of time can be used to justify the number of tests to perform {in that period. For example, our results show that, if we establish a goal of ruling out with 98\\% confidence a background prevalence of 2\\% {in a given week, and the actual prevalence is 1\\% among those eligible for proactive community testing, we would need to test 835 randomly-selected symptomatics (i.e., those presenting with COVID-like symptoms) per week via the proactive community testing program in a campus of 80k individuals. In addition to justifying decisions about the number of tests to perform, inferential precision can formalize the intuition that testing of symptomatic individuals should be prioritized over testing asymptomatic individuals in the proactive community testing program.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul J Rathouz","author_inst":"U of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Calder","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"George Barbastathis","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elena Schievano","author_inst":"Azienda Zero, regione Veneto"},{"author_name":"Elena Vecchiato","author_inst":"Azienda Zero, regione veneto"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lippi","author_inst":"Universita di Verona"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Lo Cascio","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Verona"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

These deaths are widely attributed directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic. This surge in death necessitates a matched health system response to relieve serious health related suffering at the end of life (EoL) and achieve a dignified death, through timely and appropriate expertise, medication and equipment. Identifying the human and material resource needed relies on modelling resource and understanding anticipated surges in demand. Methods A Discrete Event Simulation model designed in collaboration with health service funders, health providers, clinicians and modellers in the South West of England was created to estimate the resources required during the COVID-19 pandemic to care for deaths from COVID-19 in the community for a geographical area of nearly 1 million people. While our analysis focused on the UK setting, the model is flexible to changes in demand and setting. Results The model predicts that a mean of 11.97 hours (0.18 hours Standard Error (SE), up to a max of 28 hours) of additional community nurse time, up to 33 hours of care assistant time (mean 9.17 hours, 0.23 hours SE), and up to 30 hours additional care from care assistant night-sits (mean of 5.74 hours per day, 0.22 hours SE) will be required per day as a result of out of hospital COVID-19 deaths. Specialist palliative care demand is predicted to increase up to 19 hours per day (mean of 9.32 hours per day, 0.12 hours SE). An additional 286 anticipatory medicine bundles or \"just in case\" prescriptions per month will be necessary to alleviate physical symptoms at the EoL care for patients with COVID-19: an average additional 10.21 bundles (0.06 SE) of anticipatory medication per day.

Conclusion Modelling provides essential data to prepare, plan and deliver a palliative care pandemic response tailored to local work patterns and resource.

The Ministry of Public Health in Qatar has developed an emergency action plan to respond to the outbreak with the Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) as a main component of that response. Aim: The aim of this review is to understand and document the Impact of COVID 19 on PHCC in Qatar in terms of response, modifications of services and introduction of new alternatives Methodology: A retrospective data analysis was conducted for all the COVID-19 swabbing activities and for all the utilization services volume across the PHCC health centers between January 2018 and May 2020. Results: PHCC allocated testing sites for COVID-19 resulted in conducting 54824 swabs with 11455 positive cases and positivity rate of 20.8% between 14th of March and 15th of June 2020. The overall PHCC services utilization declined with overall reduction of 50% in April 2020. Alternative virtual and remote services were provided, telemedicine was introduced, and it made up 50% of the consultation volumes for April 2020. Home refill delivery medications managed to provide a total of 20920 delivered prescriptions by end of May 2020. Conclusion and recommendations: To decrease the risk of infection to the patients and health care workers, PHCC in Qatar cancelled the appointments for some high-risk population. However, PHCC introduced virtual remote services that managed to make up for the in-person utilization volume and reflected acceptance in patients behaviours. PHCC continued in detecting positive COVID-19 cases among its targeted communities. keywords: COVID-19, Qatar, Primary care, Service Utilization, Teleconsultation","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Mariam Abdulmalik","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Samya Al Abdulla","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Haj Bakri","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"John Gibb","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Mujeeb Kandy","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

We assessed anxiety using general anxiety disorder (GAD) scale and assessed participants risk perceptions regarding severity of the outbreak. Of the 1,017 participants, 23% reported moderate to severe anxiety (GAD score above 10). A high proportion reported perceived likelihood of ICU admission (46%) and death (30%) upon getting COVID-19. Results from path analysis showed that younger participants, those with chronic conditions, those living with children and low perceived trust in government response to COVID-19 had a significantly higher anxiety mediated by their perceived risk of dying upon getting COVID-19. These results highlight the need for management of anxiety through adequate and effective risk communication for the general public.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chetna Malhotra","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Isha Chaudhry","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Semra Ozdemir","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Irene Teo","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Eric A Finkelstein","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mujeeb Kandy","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

Methods: Systematic review of randomised trials that compared a community-based hand hygiene intervention (soap and water, or sanitiser) with a control, or trials that compared sanitiser with soap and water, and measured outcomes of ARI, ILI, or laboratory-confirmed influenza or related consequences. Searches were conducted in CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and trial registries (April 2020) and data extraction completed by independent pairs of reviewers. Results: Eighteen trials were included. When meta-analysed, three trials of soap and water versus control found a non-significant increase in ARI events (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.23, 95%CI 0.78-1.93); six trials of sanitiser versus control found a significant reduction in ARI events (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.71-0.89). When hand hygiene dose was plotted against ARI relative risk, no clear dose-response relationship was observable. Four trials were head-to-head comparisons of sanitiser and soap and water but too heterogeneous to pool: two found a significantly greater reduction in the sanitiser group compared to the soap group; two found no significant difference between the intervention arms. Conclusion: Adequately performed hand hygiene, with either soap or sanitiser, reduces the risk of ARI virus transmission, however direct and indirect evidence suggest sanitiser might be more effective in practice.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffmann","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Mina Bakhit","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Natalia Krzyzaniak","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Anna Scott","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

Here, the co-expression network was constructed by mapping the well-known ACE2, TMPRSS2 and host susceptibility genes implicated in COVID-19 GWAS onto a cornea, retinal pigment epithelium and lung. We found a significant co-expression module of these genes in the cornea, revealing that cornea is potential extra-respiratory entry portal of SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, both co-expression and interaction networks show a significant enrichment in mitochondrial function, which are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis, inflammation and innate immune response. We identified a corneal mitochondrial susceptibility module (CMSM) of 14 mitochondrial genes by integrating ACE2 co-expression cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Gene ECSIT, as a cytosolic adaptor protein involved in inflammatory responses, exhibits the strongest correlation with ACE2 in CMSM, which has shown to be an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Our co-expression and protein interaction network analysis uncover that the mitochondrial function related genes in cornea contribute to the dissection of COVID-19 susceptibility and potential therapeutic interventions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jian Yuan","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"dandan Fan","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhengbo Xue","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jia Qu","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianzhong Su","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

The purpose of this research is to develop an epidemi- ological model that allow to estimate the number of unknown\/asymptomatic cases in a given area. The SEIAMPR system, a novel simulation based model for COVID-19 is designed and implemented in Python. The intuition of the model is simple: about 80% of COVID-19 infected people evolve as asymptomatic or with a mild clinical course, many of them remain unknown to the authorities, some of them including those in critical conditions are eventually detected and classified as positive cases. The simulator reproduces this process using an adaptive method integrated with official data. The simulator has been used for modelling the outbreak in 21 regions in Italy. The positive effects of lockdown policies are demonstrated: unknown ac- tive cases 12 days after the lockdown (March the 21th) ranged from 284101 to 374038, e.g. many more than all the official cases in Italy, reducing to 10213\/20949 the reopening day. The number of unknown active cases at the beginning of June in the Lombardia region ranged from 6813 to 13390 de- manding particular attention. SEIAMPR is simple to tune and integrate with official data, it emerges as an up-and-coming tool for reporting the effect of lockdown measures, the impact of the disease on the population, and the remaining unknown active cases for evaluating the timing of exit strategies.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mauro Gaspari","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"dandan Fan","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhengbo Xue","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jia Qu","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianzhong Su","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

Design: Cross-sectional e-survey study. Setting: African countries Participants: Cardiologists Primary and Secondary outcomes measures: The primary outcome was the change in service delivery in African cardiology units during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary outcomes were the satisfaction of cardiologists with regards to the workload and factors associated with this satisfaction. Results: There was a significant reduction in working time and the number of patients consulted by week during this pandemic (p<0.001). In general, there was a decrease in the overall activities in cardiovascular care delivery. The majority of cardiology services (76.5%) and consulting programs (85%) were adjusted to the pandemic. Only half of the participants were satisfied with their workload. Reconfiguration of the consultation schedule was associated with a reduced satisfaction of participants (p=0.02). Conclusions: COVID-19 is associated with an overall reduction in cardiology services rendered in Africa. Since the cardiovascular burdens continue to increase in this part of the World and the risk of cardiovascular complications linked to SARS COV2 remains unchanged cardiology, departments in Africa should anticipate a significant surge of cardiology services demanded by patients after the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chris Nadege Nganou-Gnindjio","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Mazou Ngou Temgoua","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Liliane Mfeukeu Kuate","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Clovis Nkoke","author_inst":"Internal Medicine depatment, Buea"},{"author_name":"Joel Noutakdie Tochie","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Valerie Ndobo-Kue","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Amalia Owona-Nsiaguam","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Jerome Boombhi","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Richie Kipenge","author_inst":"Lubumbashi University Clinics, DRCongo"},{"author_name":"Urbain Huba","author_inst":"University Teaching Hospital, Yalgado Ouedraogo, Burkina faso"},{"author_name":"Malick Kane","author_inst":"National University Teaching Hospital, Fann, Senegal"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Taha el Jirari","author_inst":"National University Teaching Hospital, Fann, Senegal"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Ndongo-Amougou","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Ba Hamadou","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Alain Menanga","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Samuel Kingue","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Andrea L.

Based on data from official sources, we performed a new epidemiological analysis of the development of the pandemic in 23 countries on the American continent as of May 23, 2020. Our results confirm our previous finding, further showing that the incidence of COVID-19 on the American continent decreases significantly starting at 1,000 m above sea level (masl). Moreover, epidemiological modeling indicates that the virus transmission rate capacity is lower in the highlands (>1,000 masl) than in the lowlands (<1,000 masl). Finally, evaluating the differences in the recovery percentage of patients, the death-to-case ratio, and the theoretical fraction of undiagnosed cases, we found that the severity of COVID-19 is also decreased above 1,000 m.

Early efforts to predict hospital bed needs focused on deriving predictions from SIR models, largely at the level of countries, provinces, or states. In the United States, these models rely on data reported by state health agencies. However, predictive disease and hospitalization dynamics at the state level are complicated by geographic variation in disease parameters. In addition it is difficult to make forecasts early in a pandemic due to minimal data. However, Bayesian approaches that allow models to be specified with informed prior information from areas that have already completed a disease curve can serve as prior estimates for areas that are beginning their curve. Here, a Bayesian non-linear regression (Weibull function) was used to forecast cumulative and active COVID-19 hospitalizations for South Dakota, USA. As expected, early forecasts were dominated by prior information, which was derived from New York City. Importantly, hospitalization trends also differed within South Dakota due to early peaks in an urban area, followed by later peaks in other rural areas of the state.

We test the two most widely available ALS tumbler models, the UTF75N and UT075N, and show that if our procedure is carefully followed, the masks will be subject to suitably high and stable temperatures for decontamination; in particular the masks will be heated to at least 80C for at least 65 min. For the mask models 3M 1860, 3M 8511, and Halyard 62126, we establish that they pass quantitative fit tests and retain sufficient filtration performance after three cycles of our decontamination procedure. All masks used in this study were new and uncontaminated: the evidence for the levels of biological inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 is provided by [1]. While the protocol outlined here is currently specific to certain tested dryer models, this equipment is widely available, with machines estimated to be within 15 minutes of most US hospitals. Models from other manufacturers may also be appropriate for this decontamination method, though we stress the need for explicit testing on alternative models before use.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuri D.

To this purpose, twenty full length genomes were collected from patients addressing to several Lombard hospitals from February 20th to April 4th, 2020. The obtained genome assemblies, available on the GISAD database and performed at the Referral Center for COVID-19 diagnosis, identified 2 main monophyletic clades, containing 9 and 52 isolates, respectively. The molecular clock analysis estimated a clusters divergence approximately one month before the first patient identification, supporting the hypothesis that different SARS-CoV-2 strains spread all over the world at different time, but their presence became evident only in late February along with Italian epidemic emergence. Therefore, the epidemiological reconstruction carried out by this work highlights multiple inputs of the virus into its initial circulation in Lombardy Region.

To determine whether D614G mediates neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 Spike on their surface. In all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization. The G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies against the receptor binding domain and by convalescent sera from people known to be infected with either the D614 or G614 form of the virus. These results indicate that a gain in infectivity provided by D614G came at the cost of making the virus more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies, and that the mutation is not expected to be an obstacle for current vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Drew Weissman","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Mohamad-Gabriel Alameh","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Tushan de Silva","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Paul Collini","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Hailey Hornsby","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Brown","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Celia C LaBranche","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Robert J Edwards","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Laura Sutherland","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sampa Santra","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Mansouri","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sophie Gobeil","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Charlene McDanal","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Norbert Pardi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"LANL"},{"author_name":"Paulo J.C.

Numerous factors may influence an individuals willingness to report these symptoms. Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic Objective To determine which factors influence symptom reporting during an emerging infectious disease outbreak Methods We conducted a rapid review of the evidence. We included papers based on primary research, published in peer-reviewed journals, written in English, included factors associated with symptom reporting or accessing healthcare, and related to a major public health incident involving an infectious disease outbreak Results Five themes were identified as facilitators of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare (accurate and informative communication, symptom severity, concern about exposure, ease of access, and relationship with the healthcare provider). Seven themes were identified as barriers of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare (lack of knowledge, fear, stigmatization, invasion of privacy, low concerns about symptoms, economics, and practicalities of attending a healthcare facility) Discussion If contract tracing services are to be effective, members of the public need to have the capability, opportunity and motivation to use them. The themes identified should be used to evaluate the information provided to the public about such a service, the routes of access, and the underlying polices relating to the service, in order to ensure that as many people as possible with relevant symptoms will make contact","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrice Carter","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Odette Megnin-Viggars","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gideon James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Collini","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Hailey Hornsby","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Brown","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Celia C LaBranche","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Robert J Edwards","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Laura Sutherland","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sampa Santra","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Mansouri","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sophie Gobeil","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Charlene McDanal","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Norbert Pardi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"LANL"},{"author_name":"Paulo J.C.

The \"infection-rate\" is calculated from the rate at which an infected person approaches an uninfected susceptible individual, i.e. a potential recipient of the disease, up to a distance p, where the value of p may lie between pmin[&le;]p[&le;]pmax. We consider a situation with a total population of N individuals, living in an area A, x(t) amongst them being infected while xd(t) = {beta}'x(t) is the number that has died in the course of transmission and evolution of the epidemic. The evolution is developed under the conditions (1) a faction (t) of the [N-x(t)-xd(t)] uninfected individuals and (2) a {beta}(t) fraction of the x(t) infected population are quarantined, while the \"source-events\" that spread the infection are considered to occur with frequency {upsilon}. The processes of contact and transmission are considered to be Markovian. Transmission is assumed to be inhibited by several processes like the use of \"masks\", \"hand washing or use of sanitizers\" while \"physical distancing\" is described by p. The evolution equation for x(t) is a Riccati - type differential equation whose coefficients are time-dependent quantities, being determined by an interplay between the above parameters. A formal solution for x(t) is presented, for a \"graded lockdown\" with the parameters, 0[&le;](t), {beta}(t)[&le;]1 reaching their respective saturation values in time scales, {tau}1, {tau}2 respectively, from their initial values (0)={beta}(0)=0. The growth is predicted for several BBMP wards in Bengaluru and in urban centers in Chikkaballapur district, as an illustrative case. The above selections serve as model cases for high, moderate and thin population densities. It is seen that the evolution of [x(t)\/N] with time depends upon (a) the initial time scale of evolution, (b) the time scale of cure and (c) on the time dependence of the Lockdown function Q(t) = {[1-(t)]{middle dot}[1-{beta}(t)]}. The formulae are amenable to simple computations and show that in order to curb the spread one must ensure that Q({infty}) must be below a critical value and the vigilance has to be continued for a long time (at least 100 to 150 days) after the decay starts,to avoid all chances of the infection reappearing.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S Chateerjee","author_inst":"Ongil, No. 4, Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Taramani, Chennai 600 113, India"},{"author_name":"V.C.

So far COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and modes of death under optimised care conditions have not been systematically studied. Methods This retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was performed after implementation of a non-restricted, dynamic tertiary care model at the University Medical Center Freiburg, an experienced ARDS and ECMO referral center. All hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, secondary endpoints included major complications and modes of death. A multistate analysis and a Cox regression analysis for competing risk models were performed. Modes of death were determined by two independent reviewers. Results Between February 25, and May 8, 213 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 65 years, 129 patients (61%) were male. 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 57 patients (81%) received mechanical ventilation and 23 patients (33%) extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) support. According to the multistate model the probability to die within 90 days after COVID-19 onset was 24% in the whole cohort. If the levels of care at time of study entry were accounted for, the probabilities to die were 16% if the patient was initially on a regular ward, 47% if in the ICU and 57% if mechanical ventilation was required at study entry. Age >=65 years and male sex were predictors for in-hospital death. Predominant complications - as judged by two independent reviewers - determining modes of death were multi-organ failure, septic shock and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. Conclusion In a dynamic care model COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality remained substantial. In the absence of potent antiviral agents, strategies to alleviate or prevent the identified complications should be investigated. In this context, multistate analyses enable comparison of models-of-care and treatment strategies and allow estimation and allocation of health care resources.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siegbert Rieg","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Maja von Cube","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of"},{"author_name":"Johannes Kalbhenn","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, "},{"author_name":"Stefan Utzolino","author_inst":"Department of General and Visceral Surgery, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katharina Pernice","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart Center, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, German"},{"author_name":"Lena Bechet","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Johanna Baur","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III (Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 791"},{"author_name":"Corinna N Lang","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III (Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 791"},{"author_name":"Dirk Wagner","author_inst":"Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Wolkewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Winfried V Kern","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Charlene McDanal","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Norbert Pardi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"LANL"},{"author_name":"Paulo J.C.

We measured levels of total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD56+ NK cells, and the serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) by flow cytometry. We found that in most post-recovery patients, levels of total lymphocytes (66.67%), CD3+ T cells (54.55%), CD4+ T cells (54.55%), CD8 + T cells (81.82%), CD19+ B cells (69.70%), and CD56+ NK cells(51.52%) remained lower than normal, whereas most patients showed normal levels of IL-2 (100%), IL-4 (80.88%), IL-6 (79.41%), IL-10 (98.53%), TNF- (89.71%), IFN-{gamma} (100%) and IL-17 (97.06%). Compared to healthy controls, 2-week post-recovery patients had significantly lower absolute numbers of total lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ NK cells, along with significantly higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-{gamma} and IL-17. Among post-recovery patients, T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, were positively correlated with CD19+ B cell counts. Additionally, CD8+ T cells positively correlated with CD4+ T cells and IL-2 levels, and IL-6 positively correlated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma}. These correlations were not observed in healthy controls. By ROC curve analysis, post-recovery decreases in lymphocyte subsets and increases in cytokines were identified as independent predictors of rehabilitation efficacy. These findings indicate that the immune system has gradually recovered following COVID-19 infection; however, the sustained hyper-inflammatory response for more than 14 days suggests a need to continue medical observation following discharge from the hospital. Longitudinal studies of a larger cohort of recovered patients are needed to fully understand the consequences of the infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasi Chaolu","author_inst":"First hospital of Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinri Zhang","author_inst":"First hospital of Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Li","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Hospital of Shanxi Province"},{"author_name":"Xin Li","author_inst":"First hospital of Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Dongyan Li","author_inst":"First hospital of Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lena Bechet","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Johanna Baur","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III (Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 791"},{"author_name":"Corinna N Lang","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III (Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 791"},{"author_name":"Dirk Wagner","author_inst":"Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Wolkewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Winfried V Kern","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Charlene McDanal","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Norbert Pardi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"LANL"},{"author_name":"Paulo J.C.

Results show that in Berlin (Germany), behavioral changes of the population mostly happened \\textit{before} the government-initiated so-called contact ban came into effect. Also, the model is used to determine differentiated changes to the reinfection rate for different interventions such as reductions in activity participation, the wearing of masks, or contact tracing followed by quarantine-at-home. One important result is that successful contact tracing reduces the reinfection rate by about 30 to 40\\%, and that if contact tracing becomes overwhelmed then infection rates immediately jump up accordingly, making rather strong lockdown measures necessary to bring the reinfection rate back to below one.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastian A M\u00fcller","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Michael Balmer","author_inst":"Senozon AG Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Billy Charlton","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Ewert","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andreas Neumann","author_inst":"Senozon Deutschland GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christian Rakow","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Tilmann Schlenther","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Kai Nagel","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Dirk Wagner","author_inst":"Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Wolkewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Winfried V Kern","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Charlene McDanal","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Norbert Pardi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"LANL"},{"author_name":"Paulo J.C.

Cremations are performed for most deaths in Ontario and require coroner certification before the cremation can take place. Our objective was to provide timely analysis of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic using cremation data. Methods: This study describes cremation certificate data from January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2020, in Ontario. Cremation records during 2020 were compared to historical records from 2017-2019, grouped according to age, month, and place of death and further stratified by COVID-19 involvement. A time series model was fit to quantify the deviation in cremation trends during the COVID-19 period. Results: There have been 33 834 cremations in Ontario in 2020, and 20 898 (62%) took place from March onwards. In April, which saw the peak number of COVID-19 cases, had an additional 1,830 cremations compared to historical averages over 2017-2019, representing a 32% increase (3 871 in 2020). Time series modelling of cremations in Ontario from January 2017 demonstrated that cremations in March, April, and May 2020 exceeded the predicted increase based on modelled estimates. Even without the COVID-19 deaths, the seasonal and numerical trends for 2020 are substantially different from the historical period. Interpretation: Cremations were higher in the months during the pandemic compared to previous years. These early estimates of mortality are critical for understanding the impact of COVID-19. This study has demonstrated the utility of cremation data to provide timely mortality information during a public health emergency.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gemma Postill","author_inst":"Western University"},{"author_name":"Regan Murray","author_inst":"Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wilton","author_inst":"Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences"},{"author_name":"Richard A.

Surveillance monitoring has suggested that the age distribution of people infected with SARS CoV2 has changed since the pandemic began, but no formal analysis has been performed. Methods Retrospective review of SARS CoV2 molecular testing results from a national reference laboratory was performed. Result distributions by age and positivity were compared between early period (March to April 2020) and late periods (June to July 2020) of the COVID 19 pandemic. Additionally, a subanalysis compared changing age distributions between inpatients and outpatients. Results There were 277,601 test results of which 19320 (7.0%) were positive. The median age of infected people declined over time (p < 0.0005). In March-April, the median age of positive people was 40.8 years (Interquartile range (IQR): 29.0, 54.1). In June-July, the median age of positive people was 35.8 years (IQR: 24.0, 50.2). The positivity rate of patients under 50 increased from 6.0 to 10.6 percent and the positivity rate for those over 50 decreased from 6.3 to 5.0 percent between the early and late periods. The trend was only observed for outpatient populations. Conclusions We confirm that there is a trend toward decreasing age among persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV2 infection, but that these trends seem to be specific to the outpatient population. Overall, this suggests that observed age-related trends are driven by changes in testing patterns rather than true changes in the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 infection. This calls for caution in interpretation of routine surveillance data until testing patterns stabilize.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dina N Greene","author_inst":"University of Washington, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Michael L Jackson","author_inst":"Kaiser Permanente Washington"},{"author_name":"David R Hillyard","author_inst":"University of Utah Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Julio C Delgado","author_inst":"University of Utah Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Robert L Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Utah Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Mark J.

We aimed to explore the academic value of preprints through comparing with peer-reviewed publications, and synthesize the parameter estimates of the two kinds of literature. Method We collected papers regarding the estimation of four key epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 in China: the basic reproduction number (R0), incubation period, infectious period, and case-fatality-rate (CFR). PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arRxiv, and SSRN were searched by 20 March, 2020. Distributions of parameters and timeliness of preprints and peer-reviewed papers were compared. Further, four parameters were synthesized by bootstrap, and their validity was verified by susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-dead-cumulative (SEIRDC) model based on the context of China. Findings 106 papers were included for analysis. The distributions of four parameters in two literature groups were close, despite that the timeliness of preprints was better. Four parameter estimates changed over time. Synthesized estimates of R0 (3.18, 95% CI 2.85-3.53), incubation period (5.44 days, 95% CI 4.98-5.99), infectious period (6.25 days, 95% CI 5.09-7.51), and CFR (4.51%, 95% CI 3.41%-6.29%) were obtained from the whole parameters space, all with p<0.05. Their validity was evaluated by simulated cumulative cases of SEIRDC model, which matched well with the onset cases in China. Interpretation Preprints could reflect the changes of epidemic situation sensitively, and their academic value shouldn't be neglected. Synthesized results of literatures could reduce the uncertainty and be used for epidemic decision making.
