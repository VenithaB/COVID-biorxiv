Of particular importance is the identification of immune correlates of infection that would support public health decision-making on treatment approaches, vaccination strategies, and convalescent plasma therapy. While ELISA-based assays to detect and quantitate antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples have been developed, the detection of neutralizing antibodies typically requires more demanding cell-based viral assays. Here, we present a safe and efficient protein-based assay for the detection of serum and plasma antibodies that block the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with its receptor, angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2). The assay serves as a surrogate neutralization assay and is performed on the same platform and in parallel with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies against the RBD, enabling a direct comparison. The results obtained with our assay correlate with those of two viral based assays, a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that uses live SARS-CoV-2 virus, and a spike pseudotyped viral-vector-based assay.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kento T Abe","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Li","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Reuben Samson","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Emelissa J Valcourt","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Heidi Wood","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Alan P.

The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAuthor ContributionsCH performed research, analyzed data, and wrote the paper; CS performed research and analyzed data; AA performed research and analyzed data; AE performed research and analyzed data; SM performed research, analyzed data, and wrote the paper; MH developed the bioinformatics pipeline and analyzed data; BS contributed new reagents and concepts; MDM designed and supervised research, analyzed data and wrote the paper; all authors read, corrected and approved the final manuscript.\n\nSignificance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover, the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace, when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19. Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public health threats.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cindy Hoerner","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Christoph Schuermann","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Arne Auste","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Aileen Ebenig","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Samada Muraleedharan","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Maike Herrmann","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Barbara Schnierle","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Michael D Muehlebach","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Roxie C Girardin","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Bhavisha Rathod","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Karen Colwill","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Allison J.

Further, functional changes in viral mRNA transcription and replication, and impaired blood-brain barrier regulation were most prominently implicated in the aged, ACE2-expressing endothelial cells, when compared to the young adult mouse brains. Concordant EC transcriptomic changes were further found in normal aged human brains.

This current poses great challenges to hemodialysis (HD) patients. Objective: To make a comprehensive evaluation and comparison between HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 and the general HD patients. Methods: HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Wuhan No.5 Hospital were admitted as confirmed group from Jan 10 to Mar 15, 2020. And HD patients not infected in our dialysis center were chosen as control group. General characteristics, laboratory indicators were retrospectively collected, analyzed and compared. Results: A total of 142 cases were admitted, including 43 cases in confirmed group and 99 in control group. Body mass index (BMI) was slightly lower in confirmed group than that in control group (P=0.011). The proportion of one or less underlying disease in confirmed group(51.16%) was higher than that in control group(14.14%)(P< 0.001), and the proportion of three or more underlying diseases in confirmed group(11.63%) was lower than that in control group(52.53%)(P< 0.001). Patients in confirmed group exhibited significantly lower hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte percentage, but higher neutrophil percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. There was no significant difference in age, gender, dialysis age, primary disease, the using of ACEI\/ARB, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) , and other indicators between the two groups. Conclusions: Faced with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), HD patients with lower BMI and hemoglobin were more susceptible to be infected, which might be related to malnutrition. Once confirmed with COVID-19, HD patients expressed obviously disregulated in inflammation and immune.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaofen Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Tan","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Yong He","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Guosheng Yang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Mingmei Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Duan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Han","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Haibo Kuang","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Samira Mubareka","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L.

Accurately identifying patients at an increased risk of deterioration may help hospitals manage their resources while improving the quality of patient care. Here we present the results of an analytical model, PICTURE (Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and other UnfoReseen Events), to identify patients at a high risk for imminent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, respiratory failure, or death with the intention to improve prediction of deterioration due to COVID-19. We compare PICTURE to the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), a widespread system which has recently been assessed for use to triage COVID-19 patients. Methods The PICTURE model was trained and validated on a cohort of hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients using electronic health record data from 2014-2018. It was then applied to two hold-out test sets: non-COVID-19 patients from 2019 and patients testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020. PICTURE results were aligned to the EDI for head-to-head comparison via Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death) at two levels of granularity: (1) maximum score across an encounter with a minimum lead time before the first adverse event and (2) predictions at every observation with instances in the last 24 hours before the adverse event labeled as positive. PICTURE and the EDI were also compared on the encounter level using different lead times extending out to 24 hours. Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. Results PICTURE successfully delineated between high- and low-risk patients and consistently outperformed the EDI in both of our cohorts. In non-COVID-19 patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 - 0.834) and AUPRC of 0.109 (0.089 - 0.125) on the observation level, compared to the EDI AUROC of 0.762 (0.746 - 0.780) and AUPRC of 0.077 (0.062 - 0.090). On COVID-19 positive patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC of 0.828 (0.794 - 0.869) and AUPRC of 0.160 (0.089 - 0.199), while the EDI scored an AUROC of 0.792 (0.754 - 0.835) and AUPRC of 0.131 (0.092 - 0.159). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). Conclusion The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering a potential incipient second wave of COVID-19 infections. PICTURE also has the ability to explain individual predictions to clinicians by ranking the most important features for a prediction. The generalizability of the model will require testing in other health care systems for validation.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brandon C Cummings","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Sardar Ansari","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R Motyka","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Guan Wang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Richard P Medlin Jr.","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Steven L Kronick","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Karandeep Singh","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pauline K Park","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lena M Napolitano","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robert P Dickson","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Michael R Mathis","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Michael W Sjoding","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Admon","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kevin R Ward","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher E Gillies","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Mario Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Kathleen A McDonough","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Michael A.

We investigated seroprevalence and immune responses in subjects professionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and their family members (155 individuals; ages 5-79 years). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein aligned with PCR results that confirmed previous infection. Anti-spike IgG titers remained high 60 days post-infection and did not associate with symptoms, but spike-specific IgM did associate with malaise and fever. We found limited household transmission, with children of infected individuals seldomly seropositive, highlighting professional exposure as the dominant route of infection in our cohort. We analyzed PBMCs from a subset of seropositive and seronegative adults. TLR7 agonist- activation revealed an increased population of IL-6+TNF-IL-1{beta}+ monocytes, while SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation elicited IL-33, IL-6, IFNa2, and IL-23 expression in seropositive individuals. IL-33 correlated with CD4+ T cell activation in PBMCs from convalescent subjects, and was likely due to T cell-mediated effects on IL-33- producing cells. IL-33 is associated with pulmonary infection and chronic diseases like asthma and COPD, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. Analysis of published scRNAseq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with mild to severe COVID-19 revealed a population of IL-33-producing cells that increases with disease.

Objectives: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients and explore factors associated with hospitalization risk by race. Methods: Case series of 448 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA), an integrated health care system serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, from March 3 to May 12, 2020. KPGA members with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Multivariable analyses for hospitalization risk also included an additional 3489 persons under investigation (PUI) with suspected infection. COVID-19 treatment and outcomes, underlying comorbidities and quality of care management metrics, socio-demographic and other individual and community-level social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators. Results: Of 448 COVID-19 positive members, 68,3% was non-Hispanic Black (n=306), 18% non-Hispanic White (n=81) and 13,7% Other race (n=61). Median age was 54 [IQR 43-63) years. Overall, 224 patients were hospitalized, median age 60 (50-69) years. Black race was a significant factor in the Confirmed + PUI, female and male models (ORs from 1.98 to 2.19). Obesity was associated with higher hospitalization odds in the confirmed, confirmed + PUI, Black and male models (ORs from 1.78 to 2.77). Chronic disease control metrics (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) were associated with lower odds of hospitalization ranging from 48% to 35% in the confirmed + PUI and Black models. Self-reported physical inactivity was associated with 50% higher hospitalization odds in the Black and Female models. Residence in the Northeast region of Atlanta was associated with lower hospitalization odds in the Confirmed + PUI, White and female models (ORs from 0.22 to 0.64) Conclusions: We found that non-Hispanic Black KPGA members had a disproportionately higher risk of infection and, after adjusting for covariates, twice the risk of hospitalization compared to other race groups. We found no significant differences in clinical outcomes or mortality across race\/ethnicity groups. In addition to age, sex and comorbidity burden, pre-pandemic self-reported exercise, metrics on quality of care and control of underlying cardio-metabolic diseases, and location of residence in Atlanta were significantly associated with hospitalization risk by race groups. Beyond well-known physiologic and clinical factors, individual and community-level social indicators and health behaviors must be considered as interventions designed to reduce COVID-19 disparities and the systemic effects of racism are implemented.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felipe Lobelo","author_inst":"The Southeast Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Permanente Georgia"},{"author_name":"Alan X Bienvenida","author_inst":"The Southeast Permanente Medical Group"},{"author_name":"Serena Leung","author_inst":"The Southeast Permanente Medical Group"},{"author_name":"Armand N Mbanya","author_inst":"The Southeast Permanente Medical Group"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J.

When a new variant emerges, there is a concern regarding whether an individual exposed to one variant of a virus will have cross-reactive immune memory to the second variant. Accordingly, we analyzed the serologic reactivity of D614 (original) and G614 variant spike proteins. We found that antibodies from a high-incidence population in New York City reacted both toward the original D614 spike and the G614 spike variant. These data suggest that patients who have been exposed to either SARS-CoV-2 variant have humoral immunity that can respond against both variants.

Here, we report on the development of a de novo, high-resolution and comparative genomics guided reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. To further enhance the assay performance and to remove any subjectivity associated with operator interpretation of result, we engineered a novel hand-held smart diagnostic device. The robust diagnostic device was further furnished with automated image acquisition and processing algorithms, and the collated data was processed through artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines to further reduce the assay run time and the subjectivity of the colorimetric LAMP detection. This advanced AI algorithm-implemented LAMP (ai-LAMP) assay, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. A total of ~200 coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-suspected patient samples were tested using the platform and it was shown to be reliable, highly specific and significantly more sensitive than the current gold standard qRT-PCR. The system could provide an efficient and cost-effective platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited laboratories.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed A Rohaim","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Emily Clayton","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Irem Sahin","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Julianne Vilela","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Manar E Khalifa","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Q Al-Natour","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Bayoumi","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Aurore Poirier","author_inst":"The University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Manoharanehru Branavan","author_inst":"Brunel University London"},{"author_name":"Mukunthan Tharmakulasingam","author_inst":"University of Surrey,"},{"author_name":"Nouman S Chaudhry","author_inst":"The University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Ravinder Sodi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Poole & Bournemouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Longfleet Road, Poole, UK BH15 2JB"},{"author_name":"Amy Brown","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Burkhart","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Wendy Hacking","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Judy Botham","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Joe Boyce","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Hayley Wilkinson","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Craig Williams","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Michelle Bates","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Roberto La Ragione","author_inst":"University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Wamadeva Balachandran","author_inst":"College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences, Brunel University London, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Anil Fernando","author_inst":"The University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Munir","author_inst":"Lancaster University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.20148478","rel_title":"Natural killer cell activation related to clinical outcome of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.20148478","rel_abs":"Understanding innate immune responses in COVID-19 is important for deciphering mechanisms of host responses and interpreting disease pathogenesis. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate effector lymphocytes that respond to acute viral infections, but might also contribute to immune pathology. Here, using 28-color flow cytometry, we describe a state of strong NK cell activation across distinct subsets in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, a pattern mirrored in scRNA-seq signatures of lung NK cells. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis identified distinct immunophenotypes that were linked to disease severity. Hallmarks of these immunophenotypes were high expression of perforin, NKG2C, and Ksp37, reflecting a high presence of adaptive NK cell expansions in circulation of patients with severe disease. Finally, arming of CD56bright NK cells was observed in course of COVID-19 disease states, driven by a defined protein-protein interaction network of inflammatory soluble factors. This provides a detailed map of the NK cell activation-landscape in COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Maucourant","author_inst":"Center for Infectious

In this study we report the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of a new, high throughput, fully automated nucleic acid amplification test system for the detection of SARSCoV2. The assay utilizes target capture, transcription mediated amplification, and acridinium ester labeled probe chemistry on the automated Panther System to directly amplify and detect two separate target sequences in the ORF1ab region of the SARSCoV2 RNA genome. The probit 95% limit of detection of the assay was determined to be 0.004 TCID50\/ml using inactivated virus, and 25 c\/ml using synthetic in vitro transcript RNA targets. Analytical sensitivity (100% detection) was confirmed to be 83 to 194 c\/ml using three commercially available SARSCoV2 nucleic acid controls. No cross reactivity or interference was observed with testing six related human coronaviruses, as well as 24 other viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens, at high titer. Clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimen testing (N=140) showed 100%, 98.7%, and 99.3% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively, with a validated reverse transcription PCR NAAT for SARSCoV2 RNA.

Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in patients with diabetes admitted with COVID-19 to Mediclinic Parkview Hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 30th March to 7th June 2020. They had laboratory and\/or radiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), known as COVID-19. Variation in characteristics, length of stay in hospital, diabetes status, comorbidities and outcomes were examined. Results: A total of 103 patients with confirmed COVID-19 presentations had diabetes. During the same timeframe, 410 patients overall were admitted with COVID-19 infection. This gives a total proportion of persons admitted with COVID-19 infection and coexistent diabetes\/prediabetes of 25%. 67% (n=69) of the COVID-19 diabetes cohort were male. Patients admitted with COVID-19 and diabetes represented 17 different ethnicities. Of these, 59.2% (n=61) were Asians and 35% (n=36) were from Arab countries. Mean age (SD) was 54 (12.5) years. 85.4% (n=88) were known to have diabetes prior to admission, while 14.6% (n=15) were newly diagnosed with either diabetes or prediabetes during admission. Most patients in the study cohort had type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, with only 3% overall having type 1 diabetes (n=3). 46.9% of patients had evidence of good glycaemic control of their diabetes during the preceding 4-12 weeks prior to admission as defined arbitrarily by admission HbA1c <7.5%. 73.8% (n=76) had other comorbidities including hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and dyslipidaemia. Laboratory data Mean(SD) on admission for those who needed ward-based care versus those needing intensive care unit (ICU) care: Fibrinogen 462.75 (125.16) mg\/dl vs 660 (187.58) mg\/dl ; D-dimer 0.66 (0.55) mcg\/ml vs 2.3 (3.48) mcg\/ml; Ferritin 358.08 (442.05) mg\/dl vs 1762.38 (2586.38) mg\/dl; and CRP 33.9 (38.62) mg\/L vs 137 (111.72) mg\/L were all statistically significantly higher for the ICU cohort (p<0.05). Average length of stay in hospital was 14.55 days. 28.2% of patients needed ICU admission. 4.9% (n=5) overall died during hospitalisation (all in ICU). Conclusions: In this single-centre study in Dubai, 25% of patients admitted with COVID-19 also had diabetes\/prediabetes. Most diabetes patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 disease were males of Asian origin. 14.6% had new diagnosis of diabetes\/prediabetes on admission. The majority of patients with diabetes\/prediabetes and COVID-19 infection had other important comorbidities (n=76; 73.8%). Only 4 patients had negative COVID-19 RT-PCR but had pathognomonic changes of COVID-19 radiologically. Our comprehensive laboratory analysis revealed distinct abnormal patterns of biomarkers that are associated with poor prognosis: Fibrinogen, D-dimer, Ferritin and CRP levels were all statistically significantly higher (p<0.05) at presentation in patients who subsequently needed ICU care compared with those patients who remained ward-based. 28.2% overall needed ICU admission, out of which 5 patients died. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to compare data of COVID-19 patients admitted with and without diabetes within the UAE region.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahila Bhatti","author_inst":"Mediclinic Parkview Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amar Omer","author_inst":"Mohammad Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, UAE."},{"author_name":"Samara Khattib","author_inst":"Mediclinic Parkview Hospital"},{"author_name":"Seemin Shiraz","author_inst":"Mediclinic Parkview Hospital"},{"author_name":"Glenn Matfin","author_inst":"Mohammad Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, UAE."},{"author_name":"Ian McHardy","author_inst":"Scripps Health San Diego"},{"author_name":"Inessa Gendlina","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"D.

Here, we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions are likely to have the most impact in which settings. We introduce the concept of \"event R\", the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single infected individual at an event. We obtain a fundamental relationship between event R and four parameters: transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity of individuals, and the degree of mixing. We use reports of small outbreaks to establish event R and transmission intensity in a range of settings. We identify principles that guide whether physical distancing, masks and other barriers to transmission, or social bubbles will be most effective. We outline how this information can be obtained and used to re-open economies with principled measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Tupper","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Madi Yerlanov","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Himani Boury","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Glenn Matfin","author_inst":"Mohammad Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, UAE."},{"author_name":"Ian McHardy","author_inst":"Scripps Health San Diego"},{"author_name":"Inessa Gendlina","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"D.

In the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States (caused by outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus), testing capacity was initially very limited and has been increasing at the same time as the virus has been spreading. When estimating the incidence, it can be difficult to distinguish whether increased numbers of positive tests stem from increases in the spread of the virus or increases in testing. This has made it very difficult to identify locations in which the epidemic poses the largest public health risks. Here, we use a probabilistic model to quantify beliefs about testing strategies and understand implications regarding incidence. We apply this model to estimate the incidence in each state of the United States, and find that: (1) the Covid-19 epidemic is likely to be more widespread than reported by limited testing, (2) the Covid-19 epidemic growth in the summer months is likely smaller than it was during the spring months, and (3) the regions which are at highest risk of Covid-19 epidemic outbreaks are not always those with the largest number of positive test results.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin J Lengerich","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Willie Neiswanger","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Eugene J.

Although the lockdown is effective in such prevention, it may put the economy into a depression. Predicting the epidemic progression with government switching the lockdown on or off is critical. We propose a transfer learning approach called ALeRT-COVID using attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to predict the epidemic trends for different countries. A source model was trained on the pre-defined source countries and then transferred to each target country. The lockdown measure was introduced to our model as a predictor and the attention mechanism was utilized to learn the different contributions of the confirmed cases in the past days to the future trend. Results demonstrated that the transfer learning strategy is helpful especially for early-stage countries. By introducing the lockdown predictor and the attention mechanism, ALeRT-COVID showed a significant improvement on the prediction performance. We predicted the confirmed cases in one week when extending and easing lockdown separately. Results showed the lockdown measures is still necessary for a number of countries. We expect our research can help different countries to make better decisions on the lockdown measures.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yingxue Li","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Wenxiao Jia","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Junmei Wang","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Jianying Guo","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Qin Liu","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Guotong Xie","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Fei Wang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Amy S.

The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV2 and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, is more similar to Kawasaki disease, but also differ from this with respect to T-cell subsets, IL-17A and biomarkers associated with arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests endoglin, an endothelial glycoprotein as one of several candidate targets of autoantibodies in MIS-C.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Camila Rosat Consiglio","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Nicola Cotugno","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fabian Sardh","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Christian Pou","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Donato Amodio","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sonia Zicari","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ruggiero","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Rubens Pascucci","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lucie Rodriguez","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Veronica Santilli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tessa Campbell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Yenan Bryceson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ziyang Tan","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Daniel Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Marchesi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campana","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alberto Villani","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paolo Rossi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"- the CACTUS study team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Nils Landegren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palma","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Quirin Hammer","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.08.20148866","rel_title":"Predictors of Anxiety Regarding The COVID-19 Pandemic Among Health-care Workers in a Hospital Not Assigned to Manage COVID-19 Patients in Nepal.","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.08.20148866","rel_abs":"Introduction: We studied the levels and severity of anxiety caused by COVID-19 amongst frontline health-care workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care neurological hospital in Nepal, not assigned to manage COVID-19 cases. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 frontline Health Care Workers (HCWs) using a 10-point subjective assessment tool, the Anxiety Level Index (ALI), and the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Score (SAS), to assess the level of anxiety regarding COVID-19. Results: On ALI 55% of HCWs were found to have marked severe anxiety (6-9), however, on SAS 44% of HCWs reported anxiety. The majority HCWs were female (n=78) with nurses forming 62% of the sample size. The mean age was 26.8 years (SD 8.17). Factors associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety regarding COVID-19 on ALI were age (p=0.002), sex (p=0.001), receiving regular COVID-19 updates via social media (p=0.011) and a high frequency of checking for COVID-19 information authenticity (p=0.039). Work experience (p=0.026) and frequency of checking for information authenticity (p=0.029) were factors found to increase SAS measured anxiety and were found to be associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that respondents with work experience of less than or equal to 2 years were 0.380 (95% CI 0.158 to 0.910) times less likely to have anxiety than those with work experience of more than 2 years. Similarly, the odds of having anxiety among those who checked information authenticity less frequently was 0.377 (95% CI 0.153 to 0.931) times less than those who often did. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a substantial impact on the mental health of frontline HCWs in a hospital not assigned to manage COVID-19 patients. Length of time of worked in healthcare and the frequency of checking for COVID-19-related information were significant predictors of anxiety.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lekhjung Thapa","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS, Neuro and Allied Clinic"},{"author_name":"Aparna Ghimire","author_inst":"BPKIHS"},{"author_name":"Sulochana Ghimire","author_inst":"UCNS"},{"author_name":"Nooma Sharma","author_inst":"PAHS"},{"author_name":"Shakti Shrestha","author_inst":"Neuro and Allied Clinic"},{"author_name":"Medha Devkota","author_inst":"Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Suman Bhattarai","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Anzil Maharjan","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Subash Lohani","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Subash Phuyal","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Prathiba Maharjan","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Yenan Bryceson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ziyang Tan","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Daniel Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Marchesi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campana","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alberto Villani","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paolo Rossi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"- the CACTUS study team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Nils Landegren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palma","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Quirin Hammer","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.08.20148171","rel_title":"Sleep quality, mental health and circadian rhythms during COVID lockdown: Results from the SleepQuest Study","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.08.20148171","rel_abs":"Behavioural responses to COVID19 lockdown will define the long-term impact of psychological stressors on sleep and brain health. Here we tease apart factors that help protect against sleep disturbance. We capitalise on the unique restrictions during COVID19 to understand how time of day of daylight exposure and outside exercise interact with chronotype and sleep quality. 3474 people from the UK (median age 62, range 18 to 91) completed our online 'SleepQuest' Study between 29th April and 13th May 2020 - a set of validated questionnaires probing sleep quality, depression, anxiety and attitudes to sleep alongside bespoke questions on the effect of COVID19 lockdown on sleep, time spent outside and exercising and self-help sleep measures. Significantly more people (n=1252) reported worsened than improved sleep (n=562) during lockdown (p<0.0001). Factors significantly associated with worsened sleep included low mood (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) and suspected, proven or at risk of COVID19 symptoms (all p<0.03). Sleep improvement was related to the increased length of time spent outside (P<0.01). Older people's sleep quality was less affected than younger people by COVID19 lockdown (p<0.001). Better sleep quality was associated with going outside and exercising earlier, rather than later, in the day. However, the benefit of being outside early is driven by improved sleep in 'owl' (p=0.0002) and not 'lark' (p=0.27) chronotype, whereas, the benefit of early exercise (inside or outside) did not depend on chronotype. Defining the interaction between chronotype, mental health and behaviour will be critical for targeted lifestyle adaptations to protect brain health through current and future crises.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neil Carrigan","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Alfie R Wearn","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Saba Meky","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James Selwood","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Hugh Piggins","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Turner","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Rosemary Greenwood","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Coulthard","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Subash Lohani","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Subash Phuyal","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Prathiba Maharjan","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Yenan Bryceson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ziyang Tan","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Daniel Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Marchesi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campana","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alberto Villani","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paolo Rossi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"- the CACTUS study team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Nils Landegren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palma","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Quirin Hammer","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20149591","rel_title":"IN-UTERO MOTHER-TO-CHILD SARS-CoV-2 TRANSMISSION: viral detection and fetal immune response","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20149591","rel_abs":"Pregnancy is known to increase the risk of severe illnesses in response to viral infections. Therefore, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestational ages might be detrimental and the potential vertical transmission should be thoroughly studied. Herein, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible and, in case, whether this results in a fetal involvement. Additionally, we analyzed the role of the antibody and the inflammatory responses in placenta and plasma from SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women and fetuses. 31 SARS-CoV-2 pregnant women were enrolled. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the virus on maternal and newborns nasopharyngeal swabs, vaginal swabs, maternal and umbilical cord plasma, placenta and umbilical cord biopsies, amniotic fluids and milk. Maternal and umbilical cord plasma, and milk were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RNA expression quantification of genes involved in the inflammatory response was performed on four selected placentas. On maternal and umbilical cord plasma of the same subjects, secreted cytokines\/chemokines were quantified. SARS-CoV-2 is found in at-term placentae and in the umbilical cord blood, in the vaginal mucosa of pregnant women and in milk. Furthermore, we report the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in the umbilical cord blood of pregnant women, as well as in milk specimens. Finally, a specific inflammatory response is triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women at both systemic and placental level, and in umbilical cord blood plasma. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that in-utero vertical transmission is possible in SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. This is essential for defining proper obstetric management of COVID-19 pregnant women, or putative indications for mode and timing of delivery.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio Fenizia","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Mara Biasin","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Irene Cetin","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Vergani","author_inst":"Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Fondazione MBBM, San Gerardo Hospital, University of Milan-Bicocca, Milan"},{"author_name":"Davide Mileto","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bio-emergence Diagnosis, L.

However, Venezuelan ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages Pangolin tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. An additional three mutations (R203K\/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome. Conclusions: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries. Public health authorities should carefully follow the progress of the pandemic and its impact on displaced populations within the region.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marina Munoz","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Carolina Florez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Sergio Gomez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Angelica Rico","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Lisseth Pardo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Esther C Barros","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Carolina Hernandez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Lourdes Delgado","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Jesus Jaimes","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Luis Perez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Hala Alshammary","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ajay Obla","author_inst":"Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zenab Khan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan David Ramirez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"- the CACTUS study team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Nils Landegren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palma","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Quirin Hammer","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20149955","rel_title":"A Poorly Understood Disease?

We find strong evidence of an income gradient in the impact of the pandemic on mortality: it is twice as large in the poorest municipalities compared to other municipalities. We then show that both poor housing conditions and higher occupational exposure are likely mechanisms. Overall, these mechanisms accounts for up to 60% of the difference observed between rich and poor municipalities.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Brandily","author_inst":"Paris School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Clement Brebion","author_inst":"Centre d'Etudes de l'Emploi et du Travail"},{"author_name":"Simon Briole","author_inst":"Paris School of Economics & J-PAL Europe"},{"author_name":"Laura Khoury","author_inst":"Norwegian School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Angelica Rico","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Lisseth Pardo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Esther C Barros","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Carolina Hernandez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Lourdes Delgado","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Jesus Jaimes","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Luis Perez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Hala Alshammary","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ajay Obla","author_inst":"Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zenab Khan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan David Ramirez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"- the CACTUS study team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Nils Landegren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palma","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Quirin Hammer","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20149849","rel_title":"Severe SAR-CoV-2 infection in humans is defined by a shift in the serum lipidome resulting indysregulation of eicosanoid immune mediators","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20149849","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 10 million people worldwide with mortality exceeding half a million patients.

In a second phase, the five best performing and most available tests were further evaluated on a total of 582 sera (178 and 404 expected positive and negative, respectively), allowing the assessment of 20 possible cross-reactions with other virus. Results In the preliminary phase, among eight IgG\/pan-Ig ELISA or CLIA\/ECLIA tests, four had a sensitivity and specificity above 90% and 98% respectively, and on six IgM\/IgA tests, only one was acceptable. Only one LFA test on three showed good performances for both IgG and IgM. For all the tests IgM and IgG aroused concomitantly. In the second phase, no tests showed particular cross-reaction. We observed an important heterogeneity in the development of the antibody response, and that anti-nucleocapside (anti-N) antibodies appeared earlier than the anti-spike (anti-S) proteins. Conclusions The identified SARS-CoV-2 serology tests may be used for the diagnostic of CoviD-19 for negative RT-PCR patients presenting severe to mild suggestive symptoms or particular clinical presentation. Detection of both anti-N and anti-S could be complementary to increase the sensitivity of the analysis.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alix T.

Serological tests are critically important to determine exposure and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 within both individuals and populations. We completed SARS-CoV-2 serological testing of 1,293 parturient women at two centers in Philadelphia from April 4 to June 3, 2020. We tested 834 pre-pandemic samples collected in 2019 and 15 samples from COVID-19 recovered donors to validate our assay, which has a ~1% false positive rate. We found 80\/1,293 (6.2%) of parturient women possessed IgG and\/or IgM SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We found race\/ethnicity differences in seroprevalence rates, with higher rates in Black\/non-Hispanic and Hispanic\/Latino women. Of the 72 seropositive women who also received nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction testing during pregnancy, 46 (64%) were positive. Continued serologic surveillance among pregnant women may inform perinatal clinical practices and can potentially be used to estimate seroprevalence within the community.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dustin D.
