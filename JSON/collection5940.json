We examined whether healthier and wealthier places more successfully implemented social distancing. Methods: Mobile device location data were used to quantify declines in movement by county (n=2,633) in the United States of America, comparing April 15-17 (n=65,544,268 traces) to baseline of February 17 - March 7. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate gradients of privilege across eleven healthcare and economic indicators, adjusting for rurality and stay-at-home mandates. External validation used separate venue-specific data from Google Location Services. Findings: Counties without stay-at-home orders showed a mobility decline of -52.3% (95% CI: -50.3%, -54.3%), slightly less than the decline in mandated areas (-60.8%; 95% CI: -60.0%, -61.6%). Strong linear gradients in privilege were observed. After adjusting for rurality and stay-at-home orders, counties in the highest quintile of social distancing mobility restriction had: 52% less uninsured, 47% more primary care providers, 29% more exercise space, 27% less food insecurity, 26% less child poverty, 17% higher incomes, 14% less overcrowding, 9.6% more racial segregation, 8.2% less youth, 7.4% more elderly, and 6.2% less influenza vaccination, compared to least social distancing areas. Interpretation: Healthier and wealthier counties displayed a social distancing privilege gap, measured via smartphone mobility change. Structural inequities in this key countermeasure will influence immunity, and disease incidence and mortality.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nabarun Dasgupta","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Michele Jonsson Funk","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Allison Lazard","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Eugene White","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Stephen W.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyle at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours. Methods Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portugese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions. Results 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included into a general analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all intensities of PA (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Conversely, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 hours per day. Additionally, food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of meals) were more unhealthy during confinement with only alcohol binge drink decreasing significantly. Conclusion While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, our results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a direction that would compromise health. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups which will help develop bespoke interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviors manifest during the COVID-19 confinement.","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ACHRAF AMMAR","author_inst":"Otto-Von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Khaled Trabelsi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Hamdi Chtourou","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Boukhris","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Liwa Masmoudi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Leipziger Str. 44, Magdeburg, 39120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Leipziger Str. 44, Magdeburg, 39120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart | UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"Paris-East Creteil University, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Nicola Bragazzi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), Postgraduate School of Public Health, University of Genoa, Genoa 16132, Italy"},{"author_name":"Karim Chamari","author_inst":"Department of Research and Education \/ Aspetar, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Jordan M Glenn","author_inst":"Exercise Science Research Center, Department of Health, Human Performance and Recreation, University of Arkansas, AR 72701, Fayetteville, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas T Bott","author_inst":"Clinical Excellence Research Center, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, Stanford, USA"},{"author_name":"Faiez Gargouri","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Lotfi Chaari","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Hadj Batatia","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Gamal Mohamed Ali","author_inst":"Faculty of Physical Education, Assiut University, Assiut 71515, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Osama Abdelkarim","author_inst":"Karlsruher Institut for Technologie, Karlsruher, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Jarraya","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kais El Abed","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Nizar Souissi","author_inst":"Observatoire National du Sport, Tunis, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Lisette Van Gemert-Pijnen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Bryan L Riemann","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA 30458, USA"},{"author_name":"Laurel Riemann","author_inst":"PharmD, BCBS;

Background: Extra-pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 has been reported in the hepatic, renal and hematological systems. Most neurological manifestations are non-focal but few have reported the characteristics of ischemic strokes or investigated its pathophysiology. Methods: Over the last 6 weeks, data from four centers in New York City were collected to review the possible ischemic stroke types seen in COVID-19 positive patients. Their presentation, demographics, other related vascular risk factors, associated laboratory and coagulation markers, as well as imaging and outcomes were collected. Results: In our study, age range of patients was 25-75 with no significant male preponderance. 70% presented for acute hospitalization due the stroke. About a fifth did not have common risk factors for ischemic stroke like diabetes and hypertension. None had history of atrial fibrillation or smoking. 50% had poor outcome with four ending in mortality and one in a critical condition due ARDS. All had high Neutrophil\/Lymphocyte ratio except one who demonstrated some neurological recovery. In 70% of our cases, D-dimer levels were collected, and all showed mild to severe elevation. None of the emergent large vessel occlusion (LVO) cases had known cardiac risk factors but two out of five were found to have cardiac abnormalities during the course of their hospitalization. All LVOs had hypercoagulable lab markers especially elevated D-dimer and\/or Fibrinogen. The LVO patients were younger and sicker with a median age of 46 and mean NIHSS of 24 as opposed to non-LVOs with a median age of 62 and mean NIHSS of 6 respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 related ischemic events can be small vessel, branch emboli or large vessel occlusions. The latter is often associated with either a hypercoagulable state or cardio-embolism. Patient outcomes were worse when multi-organ or pulmonary system failure prevailed.

Data sources We will conduct searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of vitamin C, as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs, versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating vitamin C in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.

A daily online self-reported case report form consisting of the morning and evening body temperature and 11 other symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, discomfort, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, anosmia, dysgeusia, conjunctival hyperaemia). Results Most workers were tested and found positive due to a close contact with a positive colleague (49%), followed by worker-initiated testing due to symptoms (and unknown contact, 28%), and a SARS-CoV-2 positive member of the family (9.8%). 10% of NF swabs performed in the framework of contact tracing resulted positive, compared to only 2.6% through random testing. The first (index) case caused a cluster of 7 positive HCWs discovered through contact tracing and testing of 250 asymptomatic HCWs. HCWs rarely reported symptoms of a respiratory infection, and up to 90% were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms in the days surrounding the positive NF swab. During the 15-day follow-up period, up to 40% of HCWs reported anosmia and dysgeusia\/ageusia as moderate or heavy, more frequently than any other symptom. The time necessary for 95% of HCWs to be considered cured (between the positive and two negative NF swabs) was 30 days. Conclusion HCWs represent the main source of infection in healthcare institutions, 90% are asymptomatic or with symptoms not common in a respiratory infection. The time needed to overcome the infection in 95% of workers was 30 days. Contact tracing allows identifying asymptomatic workers which would spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital and is a more successful strategy than random testing.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefan Mandi\u0107-Raj\u010devi\u0107","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit,

patients with mild COVID-19 through patient-reported outcome questionnaires and objective psychophysical testing. Methods: Adult patients with COVID-19 and self-reported sudden-onset olfactory dysfunction were recruited through a public call for participation from the University of Mons. Demographic data, pathologic conditions, general and otolaryngological symptoms were collected, and general nasal complaints were evaluated with the sino-nasal outcome-22 (SNOT-22). Subjective olfactory and gustatory status was evaluated with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHNES) and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements. Objective olfactory status was evaluated using an objective psychophysical test (Identification Sniffin Stick test). Results : 86 patients completed the study. The mean age was 42 + or - 12 years. The most common symptoms were fatigue (75%), headache (63%), nasal obstruction (58%), dysgeusia (51%), postnasal drip (49%), cough (49%) and myalgia (46%). On NHNES, total loss of taste and smell were reported by 51% and 74% of patients, respectively. 65% of patients reported a total loss of smell, while the remainder reported a partial loss. Objective olfactory testing found 41 anosmic (48%), 12 hyposmics (14%), and 33 normosmics (38%) patients. There was no correlation between the objective test results and subjective reports of nasal obstruction or postnasal drip, these complaints were absent in 69% of anosmic patients. Conclusion : A significant proportion of patients reporting olfactory dysfunction related to COVID-19 infection do not have olfactory dysfunction on objective testing. Furthermore, a majority of those with measured olfactory dysfunction did not have corresponding nasal obstruction.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pierre Cabaraux","author_inst":"CHU Charleroi"},{"author_name":"Jerome R.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemics strain health systems and households. Health systems in Africa and South Asia may be particularly at risk due to potential high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, large household sizes and limited healthcare capacity. Methods. We investigated the impact of an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic on health system resources and costs, and household costs, in Karachi, Delhi, Nairobi, Addis Ababa and Johannesburg. We adapted a dynamic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease to capture country-specific demography and contact patterns. The epidemiological model was then integrated into an economic framework that captured city-specific health systems and household resource use. Findings. The cities severely lack intensive care beds, healthcare workers and financial resources to meet demand during an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic. A highly mitigated COVID-19 epidemic, under optimistic assumptions, may avoid overwhelming hospital bed capacity in some cities, but not critical care capacity. Interpretation. Viable mitigation strategies encompassing a mix of responses need to be established to expand healthcare capacity, reduce peak demand for healthcare resources, minimise progression to critical care and shield those at greatest risk of severe disease.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sedona Sweeney","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sergio Torres-Rueda","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fiammetta Bozzani","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nichola Kitson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Simon Procter","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Quaife","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anna Vassall","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicola Vincenzo Orfeo","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit, International Centre for Rural Health and Central Health Care Management of the Sa"},{"author_name":"Giusepe Ortisi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit, International Centre for Rural Health and Central Health Care Management of the Sa"},{"author_name":"Claudio Colosio","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit, International Centre for Rural Health and Central Health Care Management of the Sa"},{"author_name":"Shadi Yaghi","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Lord","author_inst":"NYU Langone health"},{"author_name":"Karthikeyan Arcot","author_inst":"Interventional Neuro Associates, NYU Langone health, Jamaical Hospital Medical Center, Brookdaly University Hospital Medical Center, Richmond University Medical"},{"author_name":"Ambooj Tiwari","author_inst":"Interventional Neuro Associates,  NYU Langone health, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Richmond University Medical"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"Paris-East Creteil University, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Nicola Bragazzi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), Postgraduate School of Public Health, University of Genoa, Genoa 16132, Italy"},{"author_name":"Karim Chamari","author_inst":"Department of Research and Education \/ Aspetar, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Jordan M Glenn","author_inst":"Exercise Science Research Center, Department of Health, Human Performance and Recreation, University of Arkansas, AR 72701, Fayetteville, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas T Bott","author_inst":"Clinical Excellence Research Center, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, Stanford, USA"},{"author_name":"Faiez Gargouri","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Lotfi Chaari","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Hadj Batatia","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Gamal Mohamed Ali","author_inst":"Faculty of Physical Education, Assiut University, Assiut 71515, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Osama Abdelkarim","author_inst":"Karlsruher Institut for Technologie, Karlsruher, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Jarraya","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kais El Abed","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Nizar Souissi","author_inst":"Observatoire National du Sport, Tunis, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Lisette Van Gemert-Pijnen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Bryan L Riemann","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA 30458, USA"},{"author_name":"Laurel Riemann","author_inst":"PharmD, BCBS;

Hospital systems across the world have been over-extended, including in Northern Italy, Ecuador, and New York City, and many other systems face similar challenges. As a result, decisions on how to best allocate very limited medical resources have come to the forefront. Specifically, under consideration are decisions on who to test, who to admit into hospitals, who to treat in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who to support with a ventilator. Given today's ability to gather, share, analyze and process data, personalized predictive models based on demographics and information regarding prior conditions can be used to (1) help decision-makers allocate limited resources, when needed, (2) advise individuals how to better protect themselves given their risk profile, (3) differentiate social distancing guidelines based on risk, and (4) prioritize vaccinations once a vaccine becomes available. Objective: To develop personalized models that predict the following events: (1) hospitalization, (2) mortality, (3) need for ICU, and (4) need for a ventilator. To predict hospitalization, it is assumed that one has access to a patient's basic preconditions, which can be easily gathered without the need to be at a hospital. For the remaining models, different versions developed include different sets of a patient's features, with some including information on how the disease is progressing (e.g., diagnosis of pneumonia). Materials and Methods: Data from a publicly available repository, updated daily, containing information from approximately 91,000 patients in Mexico were used. The data for each patient include demographics, prior medical conditions, SARS-CoV-2 test results, hospitalization, mortality and whether a patient has developed pneumonia or not. Several classification methods were applied, including robust versions of logistic regression, and support vector machines, as well as random forests and gradient boosted decision trees. Results: Interpretable methods (logistic regression and support vector machines) perform just as well as more complex models in terms of accuracy and detection rates, with the additional benefit of elucidating variables on which the predictions are based. Classification accuracies reached 61%, 76%, 83%, and 84% for predicting hospitalization, mortality, need for ICU and need for a ventilator, respectively. The analysis reveals the most important preconditions for making the predictions. For the four models derived, these are: (1) for hospitalization: age, gender, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes, immunosuppression; (2) for mortality: age, SARS-CoV-2 test status, immunosuppression and pregnancy; (3) for ICU need: development of pneumonia (if available), cardiovascular disease, asthma, and SARS-CoV-2 test status; and (4) for ventilator need: ICU and pneumonia (if available), age, gender, cardiovascular disease, obesity, pregnancy, and SARS-CoV-2 test result.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Salomon Wollenstein-Betech","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Christos G.

The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterized, and many research teams all over the world are working on either ther- apeutic or vaccination issues. Massive testing is one of the main recommendations. In addition to laboratory tests, imagery- based tools are being widely investigated. Artificial intelligence is therefore contributing to the efforts made to face this pandemic phase. Regarding patients in hospitals, it is important to monitor the evolution of lung pathologies due to the virus. A prognosis is therefore of great interest for doctors to adapt their care strategy. In this paper, we propose a method for Covid-19 prognosis based on deep learning architectures. The proposed method is based on the combination of a convolutional and recurrent neural networks to classify multi-temporal chest X-ray images and predict the evolution of the observed lung pathology. When applied to radiological time-series, promising results are obtained with an accuracy rates higher than 92%.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed Fakhfakh","author_inst":"University of Sfax, MIRACL laboratory"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"University of Sfax, MIRACL laboratory"},{"author_name":"Faiez Gargouri","author_inst":"University of Sfax, MIRACL laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lotfi Chaari","author_inst":"Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse"},{"author_name":"Nichola Kitson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Simon Procter","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Quaife","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anna Vassall","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicola Vincenzo Orfeo","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit, International Centre for Rural Health and Central Health Care Management of the Sa"},{"author_name":"Giusepe Ortisi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit, International Centre for Rural Health and Central Health Care Management of the Sa"},{"author_name":"Claudio Colosio","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Occupational Health Unit, International Centre for Rural Health and Central Health Care Management of the Sa"},{"author_name":"Shadi Yaghi","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Lord","author_inst":"NYU Langone health"},{"author_name":"Karthikeyan Arcot","author_inst":"Interventional Neuro Associates, NYU Langone health, Jamaical Hospital Medical Center, Brookdaly University Hospital Medical Center, Richmond University Medical"},{"author_name":"Ambooj Tiwari","author_inst":"Interventional Neuro Associates,  NYU Langone health, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Richmond University Medical"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"Paris-East Creteil University, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Nicola Bragazzi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), Postgraduate School of Public Health, University of Genoa, Genoa 16132, Italy"},{"author_name":"Karim Chamari","author_inst":"Department of Research and Education \/ Aspetar, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Jordan M Glenn","author_inst":"Exercise Science Research Center, Department of Health, Human Performance and Recreation, University of Arkansas, AR 72701, Fayetteville, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas T Bott","author_inst":"Clinical Excellence Research Center, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, Stanford, USA"},{"author_name":"Faiez Gargouri","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Lotfi Chaari","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Hadj Batatia","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Gamal Mohamed Ali","author_inst":"Faculty of Physical Education, Assiut University, Assiut 71515, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Osama Abdelkarim","author_inst":"Karlsruher Institut for Technologie, Karlsruher, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Jarraya","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kais El Abed","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Nizar Souissi","author_inst":"Observatoire National du Sport, Tunis, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Lisette Van Gemert-Pijnen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Bryan L Riemann","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA 30458, USA"},{"author_name":"Laurel Riemann","author_inst":"PharmD, BCBS;

The case fatality rates (CFR) reported in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic substantially differ between countries. For SARS-CoV-2 infection with its broad clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to severe disease courses, the infection fatality rate (IFR) is the more reliable parameter to predict the consequences of the pandemic. Here we combined virus RT-PCR testing and assessment for SARS-CoV2 antibodies to determine the total number of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections in a given population. Methods: A sero-epidemiological GCP- and GEP-compliant study was performed in a small German town which was exposed to a super-spreading event (carnival festivities) followed by strict social distancing measures causing a transient wave of infections. Questionnaire-based information and biomaterials were collected from a random, household-based study population within a seven-day period, six weeks after the outbreak. The number of present and past infections was determined by integrating results from anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG analyses in blood, PCR testing for viral RNA in pharyngeal swabs and reported previous positive PCR tests. Results: Of the 919 individuals with evaluable infection status (out of 1,007; 405 households) 15.5% (95% CI: [12.3%; 19.0%]) were infected. This is 5-fold higher than the number of officially reported cases for this community (3.1%). Infection was associated with characteristic symptoms such as loss of smell and taste. 22.2% of all infected individuals were asymptomatic. With the seven SARS-CoV-2-associated reported deaths the estimated IFR was 0.36% [0.29%; 0.45%]. Age and sex were not found to be associated with the infection rate. Participation in carnival festivities increased both the infection rate (21.3% vs. 9.5%, p<0.001) and the number of symptoms in the infected (estimated relative mean increase 1.6, p=0.007). The risk of a person being infected was not found to be associated with the number of study participants in the household this person lived in. The secondary infection risk for study participants living in the same household increased from 15.5% to 43.6%, to 35.5% and to 18.3% for households with two, three or four people respectively (p<0.001). Conclusions: While the number of infections in this high prevalence community is not representative for other parts of the world, the IFR calculated on the basis of the infection rate in this community can be utilized to estimate the percentage of infected based on the number of reported fatalities in other places with similar population characteristics. Whether the specific circumstances of a super-spreading event not only have an impact on the infection rate and number of symptoms but also on the IFR requires further investigation. The unexpectedly low secondary infection risk among persons living in the same household has important implications for measures installed to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bianca Schulte","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Beate Kuemmerer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Enrico Richter","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Hoeller","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christine Fuhrmann","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Eva Bartok","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ramona Dolscheid","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Moritz Berger","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lukas Wessendorf","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Monika Eschbach-Bludau","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Angelika Kellings","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Astrid Schwaiger","author_inst":"Biobank Core Unit, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Coenen","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna-Maria Eis-Huebinger","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Schmithausen","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Matthias Schmid","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gunther Hartmann","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany;

Objective: To quantify admission laboratory and comorbidity features associated with critical illness and mortality risk across 6 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: Retrospective cohort study using hospital course, prior diagnoses, and laboratory values. Setting: Emergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals. Participants: All individuals with hospital admission and positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by PCR testing across these 6 hospitals through June 5, 2020. Exposure: Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Main Outcome Measures: Severe illness defined by ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Among 2,511 hospitalized individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (of whom 50.9% were male, 53.9% white, and 27.0% Hispanic, with mean age 62.6 years), 215 (8.6%) were admitted to the ICU, 164 (6.5%) required mechanical ventilation, and 292 (11.6%) died. L1-regression models developed in 3 of these hospitals yielded area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.807 for severe illness and 0.847 for mortality in the 3 held-out hospitals. In total, 212\/292 (78%) of the deaths occurred in the highest-risk mortality quintile.

The effective control of this infectious disease requires access to diagnostic techniques, both for case finding and epidemic size estimation. The molecular technique is routinely being used worldwide. Although it is the standard case detection and management method, it has its own shortcomings. Thus, some easy-to-use rapid serological tests were developed. Methods: One hundred and fourteen positive RT-PCR-diagnosed patients were tested by VivaDiag Kit, a brand of rapid serological kits available in hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. Frozen serum specimens taken from healthy people in summer and autumn 2019, were also tested as negative controls. Results: The test sensitivity was 47.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.8-56.9) for IgM and 47.0% (95% CI: 38.0-56.0) for IgG. There was no difference between IgG and IgM seropositivity except in one case. Specificity was calculated as 99.0% (95% CI: 96.4-99.9) for IgM and of 100.0% (95% CI: 0.98.2-100.0) for IgG. Sensitivity was higher in men and older participants. Conclusion: This test can be used for epidemiological investigations especially for the estimation of the level of infection in the community, after it is properly corrected for sensitivity and specificity. The low sensitivity could be attributed to the technical limitation of the kits or low levels of antibodies after infection. The different sensitivity in age and sex groups supports the hypothesis that different people show different immune responses to this virus.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"hamid reza shamsollahi","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Mostafa Amini","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Shaban Alizadeh","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Saharnaz Nedjat","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali Akbari-Sari","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Rezaei","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyed Farshad Allameh","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Akbar Fotouhi","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Masud Yunesian","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Lukas Wessendorf","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Monika Eschbach-Bludau","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Angelika Kellings","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Astrid Schwaiger","author_inst":"Biobank Core Unit, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Coenen","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna-Maria Eis-Huebinger","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Schmithausen","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Matthias Schmid","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gunther Hartmann","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany;

Our objective was to identify early prognostic factors upon admission to optimize the management of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a medical ward. Methods: French single-center prospective cohort study of 152 patients with positive Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, hospitalized in a medical ward. Multivariable models and a simplified scoring system assessed predictive factors of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer or death at day 14 (D14), of being discharge alive and severe status at D14 (remaining with ventilation, or death). A validation was performed on an external sample of 132 patients. Findings: At D14, the probability of ICU transfer or death was 32% (95% CI 25-40). Older age (OR 2.61, 95% CI 0.96-7.10), poorer respiratory presentation (OR 4.04 per 1-point increment on World Health Organization (WHO) clinical scale, 95% CI 1.76-9.25), higher CRP-level (OR 1.63 per 100mg\/L increment, 95% CI 0.98-2.71) and lower lymphocytes count (OR 0.36 per 1000\/mm3 increment, 95% CI 0.13-0.99) were associated with an increased risk of ICU requirement or death. A 8-point ordinal scale scoring system defined low (score 0-2), moderate (score 3-5), and high (score 6-8) risk patients, with predicted respectively 2%, 25% and 81% risk of ICU transfer or death at D14. Interpretation: In this prospective cohort study of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a medical ward in France, 32% were transferred to ICU or died. A simplified scoring system at admission predicted the outcome at D14.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yves Allenbach","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universites, AP-HP, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, F-75013, Paris, France, Centre Natio"},{"author_name":"David Saadoun","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universites, AP-HP, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, F-75013, Paris, France, Centre Natio"},{"author_name":"Georgina Maalouf","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universites, AP-HP, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, F-75013, Paris, France, Centre Natio"},{"author_name":"Matheus Vieira","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universites, AP-HP, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, F-75013, Paris, France, Centre Natio"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Hellio","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universites, AP-HP, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, F-75013, Paris, France, Centre Natio"},{"author_name":"Jacques Boddaert","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, AP-HP, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Department of Geriatrics, F-75013, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Helene Gros","author_inst":"Robert-Ballanger Hospital, Aulnay-sous-Bois cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Joe Elie Salem","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, AP-HP, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, CIC Pitie-Salpetriere (CIC-1901), Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Investigation Center"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Resche-Rigon","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Medical Information, AP-HP Saint-Louis University Hospital;

However, the kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly described and relies on the performance of the different serological tests. In this study, we evaluated the performance of six CE-marked point-of-care tests (POC) and three ELISA assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by exploring seroconversions in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Both the ELISA and POC tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least half of the samples collected seven days or more after the onset of symptoms. After 15 days, the rate of detection rose to over 80% but without reaching 100%, irrespective of the test used. More than 90% of the samples collected after 15 days tested positive using the iSIA and Accu-Tell POC tests and the ID.Vet IgG ELISA assay. Seroconversion was observed 5 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms. Three assays suffer from a specificity below 90% (EUROIMMUN IgG and IgA, UNscience, Zhuhai Livzon). The second week of COVID-19 seems to be the best period for assessing the sensitivity of commercial serological assays. To achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19 based on antibody detection, a dual challenge must be met: the immunodiagnostic window period must be shortened and an optimal specificity must be conserved.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edouard TUAILLON","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Karine Bollore","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Amandine Pisoni","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Segolene Debiesse","author_inst":"Inserm U1058"},{"author_name":"Constance Renault","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Sylvain Marie","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Soraya Groc","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Clemence Niels","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Pansu","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne-Marie Dupuy","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Morquin","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Bourdin","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Vincent Le Moing","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Philippe Van de Perre","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Markus Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna-Maria Eis-Huebinger","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Schmithausen","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Matthias Schmid","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gunther Hartmann","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany;

Identifying the association between medications taken prior to the infection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might be useful during the current pandemic until a proven treatment is developed. We aimed to determine whether the risk of developing COVID-19 was associated with the use of various drugs that may increase or decrease susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and COVID-19. Methods and Findings: A case-control study was performed using a nationwide claims database of South Korea, where a large testing capacity has been available throughout the pandemic. Exposure was defined as the prescription of study drugs that would have been continued until 7 days before the testing for COVID-19. Adults were considered eligible if they were >=18 years old and tested for COVID-19. Among the 65,149 eligible subjects (mean age, 48.3 years; 49.4% male), 5,172 (7.9%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with the risk of COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% CI, 0.95-2.31). In the overall population, lower risks of COVID-19 were associated with the use of camostat (aOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-1.02) and amiodarone (aOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33-0.89), although the differences were not significant in the subgroup analyses. Angiotensin receptor blockers were also associated with a slightly increased risk of COVID-19 (aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26), which was also not observed in the subgroup analysis. The study limitations include potential bias regarding the controls' characteristics, inability to determine prescription compliance, and a lack of information regarding the severity of underlying conditions. Conclusions. No medications were consistently associated with increased or decreased risks of COVID-19. These findings suggest that a more cautious approach is warranted for the clinical use of re-purposed drugs until the results are available from clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyungmin Huh","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Wonjun Ji","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea"},{"author_name":"Minsun Kang","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Jinwook Hong","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Gi Hwan Bae","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Rugyeom Lee","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Yewon Na","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Hyoseon Choi","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Seon Yeong Gong","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Jaehun Jung","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine;

Highest non-primary attack rates(ARs) were observed at a subsequent local religious gathering (14.8% [95%CI: 7.1,27.7]) and in the household (10.6% [95%CI: 7.3,15.1]. Household ARs of symptomatic cases were higher (14.4% [95%CI: 8.8,19.9]) than asymptomatic (4.4% [95%CI: 0.0,10.5]) or presymptomatic cases (6.1% [95%CI: 0.3,11.8]). Low ARs (<1%) were observed for workplace and social settings. Our analysis highlights that SARS-CoV-2 transmission varies depending on environmental, behavioural and host factors. We identify 'red flags' of potential super-spreading events, namely densely populated gatherings for prolonged periods in enclosed settings, presence of individuals with recent travel history, and group behaviours such as communal eating, sleeping and sharing of personal hygiene facilities. We propose differentiated testing strategies that account for transmission risk.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liling Chaw","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Wee Chian Koh","author_inst":"Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Sirajul Adli Jamaludin","author_inst":"Environmental Health Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Lin Naing","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Fathi Alikhan","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Yewon Na","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Hyoseon Choi","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Seon Yeong Gong","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Jaehun Jung","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine;

Several countries have declared a stringent lock-down in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. This analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lock-down on infection and death rates over a period of time. Material and Methods: A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lock-down. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lock-down in a second-phase cluster analysis. Results: There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lock-down in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths fared poorly compared to those who declared lock-down early on. Sweden and South Korea fared equally well, as most lock-down countries stemmed the growth of infection and death. Conclusion: Lock-down has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 disease progression exponentially. However, lessons need to be learned from Sweden and South Korea on arresting the disease progression without imposing such stringent measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SAMIT GHOSAL","author_inst":"Nightingale Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rahul Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Private Practitioner"},{"author_name":"Milan Majumder","author_inst":"Independent Statistician"},{"author_name":"Lin Naing","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Fathi Alikhan","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Yewon Na","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Hyoseon Choi","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Seon Yeong Gong","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Jaehun Jung","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine;

There are speculations that climatic conditions can slowdown the transmission of COVID-19.Findings from the early outbreak indicated the possible association of air temperature and relative humidity in COVID-19 occurrence in China. Current study focused on whether climatic conditions(temperature and relative humidity)are having any influence in the occurrence of COVID-19 when the outbreak has been classified as pandemic. To determine the effect of daily average temperature and average relative humidity on log-transformed total daily cases of COVID-19, polynomial regression as a quadratic term and linear regression were done. Linear regression analysis was also carried out to explore the same effect on selected countries. Present study observed no correlation between the climatic conditions (the daily average temperature and relative humidity) and the number of cases of COVID-19. Similar result was found in relation between daily average temperature and average number of cases per day in country-wise analysis. However, about 93.5% cases of COVID-19 occurred between 1{degrees}C to 16{degrees}C and the average number of cases per day was lower in high temperature country than low temperature country with exceptions. The minimum effect of summer temperature may not be effective to control the pandemic rather need to apply the control measures of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.Abdus Sobur","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Md.Saiful Islam","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Md.Emdadul Haque","author_inst":"Faculty of Fisheries, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"AMM Taufiquer Rahman","author_inst":"Naogaon District Hospital, Naogaon, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Md.Taohidul Islam","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Antonio Toniolo","author_inst":"Global Virus Network, University of Insubria, 21100 Varese, Italy."},{"author_name":"Md.Tanvir Rahman","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Hyoseon Choi","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Seon Yeong Gong","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Jaehun Jung","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine;

Objective: To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on public surfaces in a densely populated urban area in Brazil. Design and Setting: A total of 101 samples were collected from different surfaces in public places in the region of Belo Horizonte with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. Samples were collected near the hospital and public transportation areas using sterile swabs, and then submitted to nucleic acid extraction and genomic detection and quantification by one-step qPCR. Results: Seventeen of the 101 samples tested positive (16.8%) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including samples from bus stations\/terminals, public squares, and sidewalks, including those near hospitals. Conclusions and Relevance: Our data indicated the contamination of public surfaces by SARS-CoV-2, especially near hospital areas, highlighting the risk of infection for the population. Constant monitoring of the virus in urban areas is required as a strategy to fight the pandemic and prevent further infections.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonatas Santos Abrahao","author_inst":"UFMG"},{"author_name":"Livia Sacchetto Pengo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Izabela Mauricio Rezende","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Rodrigues","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Ana Paula Correia Crispim","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Cesar Moura","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Diogo Correa Mendonca","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Erik Reis","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Fernanda Garcia Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Iago Jose da Silva Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Paulo Boratto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Pedro Henrique Bastos e Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Victoria Fulgencio Queiroz","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Thais Barbara de Souza Silva","author_inst":"Instituto Rene Rachou"},{"author_name":"Graziele Pereira Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Viviane de Souza Alves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Pedro Augusto Alves","author_inst":"Instituto Rene Rachou"},{"author_name":"Erna Geessien Kroon","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Giliane de Souza Trindade","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Betania Paiva Drumond","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"Paris-East Creteil University, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Nicola Bragazzi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), Postgraduate School of Public Health, University of Genoa, Genoa 16132, Italy"},{"author_name":"Karim Chamari","author_inst":"Department of Research and Education \/ Aspetar, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Jordan M Glenn","author_inst":"Exercise Science Research Center, Department of Health, Human Performance and Recreation, University of Arkansas, AR 72701, Fayetteville, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas T Bott","author_inst":"Clinical Excellence Research Center, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, Stanford, USA"},{"author_name":"Faiez Gargouri","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Lotfi Chaari","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Hadj Batatia","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Gamal Mohamed Ali","author_inst":"Faculty of Physical Education, Assiut University, Assiut 71515, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Osama Abdelkarim","author_inst":"Karlsruher Institut for Technologie, Karlsruher, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Jarraya","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kais El Abed","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Nizar Souissi","author_inst":"Observatoire National du Sport, Tunis, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Lisette Van Gemert-Pijnen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Bryan L Riemann","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA 30458, USA"},{"author_name":"Laurel Riemann","author_inst":"PharmD, BCBS;

We came up with a two-arm controlled study design to simulate the treated and the untreated (control group) group by applying two respective transition models to the empirical data on dynamics of the disease severity (Figure 2 of the original article7) that are classified into low- (no and low oxygen supplement), medium- (non-invasive ventilator and high oxygen supplement), and high-(ECMO and invasive ventilator) from enrolment until discharge, death or the end of follow-up. By using a simulated two-arm controlled study, the remdesivir treatment group as opposed to the control group led to a statistically significantly 29% (95% CI: 22-35%) reduction of death from COVID-19. The treated group also revealed a 33% (95% CI 28-38%) significantly higher odds of discharge than the control group. The median time to discharge for the treated group (5.5 days, 16.5 days, and 29.5 days for low-, medium-, and high-risk state, respectively) was around half of those of the control arm. Our results with a simulated two-arm controlled study have not only corroborated the efficacy of remdesivir but also made great contribution to designing a further large-scale randomized controlled trial. They have significant implications for reducing transmission probability and infectious time of COVID-19 patients when contacting with susceptible health care workers during hospitalization.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen-Yang Hsu","author_inst":"Dachung Hospital, Miaoli, Taiwan."},{"author_name":"Chao-Chih Lai","author_inst":"Emergency Department of Taipei City Hospital, Ren-Ai Branch, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Amy Ming-Fang Yen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Sam Li-She Chen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Hsiu-Hsi Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Cesar Moura","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Diogo Correa Mendonca","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Erik Reis","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Fernanda Garcia Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Iago Jose da Silva Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Paulo Boratto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Pedro Henrique Bastos e Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Victoria Fulgencio Queiroz","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Thais Barbara de Souza Silva","author_inst":"Instituto Rene Rachou"},{"author_name":"Graziele Pereira Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Viviane de Souza Alves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Pedro Augusto Alves","author_inst":"Instituto Rene Rachou"},{"author_name":"Erna Geessien Kroon","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Giliane de Souza Trindade","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Betania Paiva Drumond","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"Paris-East Creteil University, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Nicola Bragazzi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), Postgraduate School of Public Health, University of Genoa, Genoa 16132, Italy"},{"author_name":"Karim Chamari","author_inst":"Department of Research and Education \/ Aspetar, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Jordan M Glenn","author_inst":"Exercise Science Research Center, Department of Health, Human Performance and Recreation, University of Arkansas, AR 72701, Fayetteville, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas T Bott","author_inst":"Clinical Excellence Research Center, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, Stanford, USA"},{"author_name":"Faiez Gargouri","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Lotfi Chaari","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Hadj Batatia","author_inst":"University of Toulouse, IRIT - INP-ENSEEIHT, France"},{"author_name":"Gamal Mohamed Ali","author_inst":"Faculty of Physical Education, Assiut University, Assiut 71515, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Osama Abdelkarim","author_inst":"Karlsruher Institut for Technologie, Karlsruher, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Jarraya","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kais El Abed","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Nizar Souissi","author_inst":"Observatoire National du Sport, Tunis, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Lisette Van Gemert-Pijnen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Bryan L Riemann","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA 30458, USA"},{"author_name":"Laurel Riemann","author_inst":"PharmD, BCBS;

These regimens were primarily relying on mechanism-of-action based selection of drugs, many of which have yielded positive in vitro but largely negative clinical outcomes. To overcome this challenge, we report the use of IDentif.AI, a platform that rapidly optimizes infectious disease (ID) combination therapy design using artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, IDentif.AI was implemented on a 12-drug candidate therapy search set representing over 530,000 possible drug combinations. IDentif.AI demonstrated that the optimal combination therapy against SARS-CoV-2 was comprised of remdesivir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, which mediated a 6.5-fold improvement in efficacy over remdesivir alone. Additionally, IDentif.AI showed hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to be relatively ineffective. The identification of a clinically actionable optimal drug combination was completed within two weeks, with a 3-order of magnitude reduction in the number of tests typically needed. IDentif.AI analysis was also able to independently confirm clinical trial outcomes to date without requiring any data from these trials. The robustness of the IDentif.AI platform suggests that it may be applicable towards rapid development of optimal drug regimens to address current and future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agata Blasiak","author_inst":"The N.1 Institute for Health (N.1), Institute for Digital Medicine (WisDM), and Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapor"},{"author_name":"Jhin Jieh Lim","author_inst":"Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599"},{"author_name":"Shirley Gek Kheng Seah","author_inst":"Defence Medical and Environmental Research Institute, DSO National Laboratories, Singapore 117510 Singapore"},{"author_name":"Theodore Kee","author_inst":"The N.1 Institute for Health (N.1), Institute for Digital Medicine (WisDM), and Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapor"},{"author_name":"Alexandria Remus","author_inst":"The N.1 Institute for Health (N.1), Institute for Digital Medicine (WisDM), and Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapor"},{"author_name":"De Hoe Chye","author_inst":"Defence Medical and Environmental Research Institute, DSO National Laboratories, Singapore 117510 Singapore"},{"author_name":"Pui San Wong","author_inst":"Defence Medical and Environmental Research Institute, DSO National Laboratories, Singapore 117510 Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lissa Hooi","author_inst":"Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599"},{"author_name":"Anh T.L.

Famotidine is commonly used for gastric acid suppression but has recently gained attention as an antiviral that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. This study tested whether famotidine use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 initially hospitalized to a non-intensive care setting. Methods: This was retrospective cohort study conducted among consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection from February 25 to April 13, 2020 at a single medical center. The primary exposure was famotidine, received within 24 hours of hospital admission. The primary outcome was intubation or death. Propensity score matching was used to balance the baseline characteristics of patients who did and did not use famotidine. Results: 1,620 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were identified including 84 (5.1%) who received famotidine within 24 hours of hospital admission. 340 (21%) patients met the study composite outcome of death or intubation. Use of famotidine was associated with reduced risk for death or intubation (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.85) and also with reduced risk for death alone (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.80). After balancing baseline patient characteristics using propensity score matching, these relationships were unchanged (HR for famotidine and death or intubation 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.88). Proton pump inhibitors, which also suppress gastric acid, were not associated with reduced risk for death or intubation. Conclusion: Famotidine use is associated with reduced risk of intubation or death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to determine whether famotidine therapy improves outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel E Freedberg","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Joseph Conigliaro","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Magdalena E Sobieszczyk","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David D Markowitz","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Aakriti Gupta","author_inst":"ddm1@cumc.columbia.edu"},{"author_name":"Max R.

This information is critical to balance the competing safety considerations of reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and cancer treatment continuation. Since March 10th, 2020 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center performed diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients. Overall, 40% out of 423 patients with cancer were hospitalized for COVID-19 illness, 20% developed severe respiratory illness, including 9% that required mechanical ventilation, and 9% that died. On multivariate analysis, age [&ge;] 65 years and treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) within 90 days were predictors for hospitalization and severe disease, while receipt of chemotherapy within 30 days and major surgery were not. Overall, COVID-19 illness is associated with higher rates of hospitalization and severe outcomes in patients with cancer. Association between ICI and COVID-19 outcomes will need interrogation in tumor-specific cohorts.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth V.
