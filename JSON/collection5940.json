Currently, the spread of local epidemics has been basically blocked. The import of overseas epidemics has become the main form of growth in China's new epidemic. As an important international transportation hub in China, Shanghai is one of the regions with the highest risk of imported cases abroad. Due to imported of overseas cases are affected by the international epidemic trend. The traditional infectious disease model is difficult to accurately predict the cumulative trend of cumulative cases in the Shanghai areas. It is also difficult to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the international traffic blockade. In this situation, this study takes Shanghai as an example to propose a new type of infectious disease prediction model. The model first uses the sparse graph model to analyze the international epidemic spread network to find countries and regions related to Shanghai. Next, multiple regression models were used to fit the existing COV-19 growth data in Shanghai. Finally, the model can predict the growth curve of Shanghai's epidemic without blocking traffic. The results show that the control measures taken by Shanghai are very effective. At present, more and more countries and regions will face the current situation in Shanghai. We recommend that other countries and regions learn from Shanghai's successful experience in preventing overseas imports in order to fully prepare for epidemic prevention and control.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qi Dang","author_inst":"Faculty of Information Technology, Macau University of Science and Technology,  Avenida Wai Long, Taipa, Macau, China"},{"author_name":"Miao Rui","author_inst":"Faculty of Information Technology, Macau University of Science and Technology,  Avenida Wai Long, Taipa, Macau, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Yong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicines, Macau University of Science and Techn"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20099804","rel_title":"Environmental indicator for effective control of COVID-19 spreading","rel_date":"2020-05-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20099804","rel_abs":"Recently, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused viral pneumonia worldwide, spreading to more than 200 countries, posing a major threat to international health. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, in this study, we report that the city lockdown measure was an effective way to reduce the number of new cases, and the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration can be adopted as an environmental lockdown indicator. In China, after strict city lockdown, the average NO2 concentration decreased 55.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.5-59.6%) and the total number of newly confirmed cases decreased significantly. Our results also indicate that the global airborne NO2 concentration steeply decreased over the vast majority of COVID-19-hit areas based on satellite measurements. We found that the total number of newly confirmed cases reached an inflection point about two weeks after the lockdown. The total number of newly confirmed cases can be reduced by about 50% within 30 days of the lockdown. The stricter lockdown will help newly confirmed cases to decline earlier and more rapidly. Italy, Germany and France are good examples. Our results suggest that NO2 satellite measurement can help decision makers effectively monitor control regulations to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinbo Lian","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Huang Sr.","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chuwei Liu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Liu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Lina Wang","author_inst":"Gansu Province Environmental Monitoring Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20099945","rel_title":"SARS pandemic exposure impaired early childhood development: A lesson for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20099945","rel_abs":"Social and mental stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may promote long-term effects on child development. However, reports aimed at identifying the relationship between pandemics and child health are limited. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003 and its relationship to child development indicators using a representative sample across China. Our study involved longitudinal measurements of 14,647 children, 36% of whom (n = 5216) were born before or during the SARS pandemic. Cox models were utilized to examine the effects of SARS on preterm birth and four milestones of development: age to (1) walk independently, (2) say a complete sentence, (3) count from 0 to 10, and (4) undress him\/herself for urination. Mixed effect models were utilized to associate SARS with birthweight, body weight and height. Our results show that experiencing SARS during early childhood was significantly associated with delayed milestones, with adjusted hazard ratios of 3.17 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 2.71, 3.70], 3.98 (3.50, 4.53), 4.96 (4.48, 5.49), or 5.57 (5.00, 6.20) for walking independently, saying a complete sentence, counting from 0 to 10, and undressing him\/herself for urination, respectively. Experiencing SARS was also associated with reduced body weight. This effect was strongest for preschool children [a weight reduction of 4.86 (0.36, 9.35) kg, 5.48 (-0.56, 11.53) kg or 5.09 (-2.12, 12.30) kg for 2, 3, 4 year-olds, respectively]. We did not identify a significant effect of maternal SARS exposure on birthweight or gestational length. Collectively, our results showed that the SARS pandemic was associated with delayed child development and provided epidemiological evidence to support the association between infectious disease epidemics and impaired child health. These results provide a useful framework to investigate and mitigate relevant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunfei Fan","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Huiyu Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qiong Wu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhou","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Yubo Zhou","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Bin Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yiqun Han","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tao xue","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Tong Zhu","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20100677","rel_title":"Number of International Arrivals Predicts Severity of the first Global Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20100677","rel_abs":"Importance: Reported death rates from different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic vary. Lack of universal testing and death underreporting make between-country comparisons difficult. The country-level determinants of COVID-19 mortality are unknown. Objective: Derive a measure of COVID-related death rates that is comparable across countries and identify its country-level predictors. Design: An ecological study design of publicly available data was employed. Countries reporting >25 COVID-related deaths until 08\/06\/2020 were included. The outcome was log mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential determinants assessed were most recently published demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, median age, average body mass index, smoking prevalence), Economic parameters (Gross Domestic Product per capita); environmental parameters: pollution levels, mean temperature (January-April)), co-morbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer), health system parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10,000 population); international arrivals and the stringency index, as a measure of country-level response to COVID-19. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the data. Results: Thirty-seven countries were included. Of all country-level predictors included in the multivariable model, only total number of international arrivals was significantly associated with the mean death rate: Beta 0.040 (95% Confidence Interval 0.017, 0.063), P <0.001. Conclusions and Relevance: International travel was directly associated with the mortality slope and thus potentially the spread of COVID-19. Very early restrictions on international travel may be a very effective strategy to control COVID outbreak and prevent related deaths.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiberiu A Pana","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Sohinee Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"David T Gamble","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Zahra Pasdar","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Weronika A Szlachetka","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Jesus A Perdomo-Lampignano","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"David McLernon","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Phyo K Myint","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Tong Zhu","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20100727","rel_title":"National estimates of critical care capacity in 54 African countries.","rel_date":"2020-05-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20100727","rel_abs":"Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an emerging threat across the African continent where national critical care capacity is underdeveloped or unknown.

The onset of disease and its transmission and severity has become a global concern. The policymakers have a serious concern for containing the spread and minimising the risk of death. Aim: This study aims to provide the estimates of basic reproduction rate (R0) and case fatality rate (CFR) which applies to a generalised population. Methods: A systematic review was carried out to retrieve the published estimates of reproduction rate and case fatality rate in peer-reviewed articles from PubMed MEDLINE database with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria in the period 15 December 2019 to 3 May 2020. The systematic review led to the selection of 24 articles for R0 and 17 articles for CFR. These studies used data from China and its provinces, other Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and countries from other parts of the world such as Nigeria, Iran, Italy, Europe as a whole, France, Latin America, Turkey, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (USA). These selected articles gave an output of 30 counts of R0 and 29 counts of CFR which were used in a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis, with the inverse variance method, fixed- and random-effects model and the Forest plot, was performed to estimate the mean effect size or mean value of basic reproduction rate and case fatality rate. The Funnel plot is used to comprehend the publication bias. Results: We estimated the robust estimate of R0 at 3.11 (2.49-3.71) persons and the robust estimate of CFR at 2.56 (2.06-3.05) per cent after accounting for heterogeneity among studies, using the random-effects model. The regional subgroup analysis in a meta-analysis was significant for R0 but was not significant for CFR. The R0 values varied from 1.90 (1.06-2.74) persons to 3.83 (2.44-5.22) persons across the regions. The Funnel plot confirms that the selected studies are significant at one per cent level of significance. Conclusion: We found that one person is likely to infect two to three persons in the absence of any control measures, and around three per cent of the population are at the risk of death within one-and-a-half months from the onset of disease COVID-19 in a generalised population. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 varies across regions, but the risk of death remains the same. Contribution: The estimates of R0 and CFR are independent of data from a particular region or time or a homogeneous population. These estimates are applicable to a generalised population. Therefore, the estimates of R0 and CFR are unequivocally applicable to developing country like India and its states or districts, in ambivalence. The assessments of R0 and CFR values across the developed nations make all of us aware of consequences of COVID-19, and hence these estimates are of crucial importance for government authorities for the practical implementation of strategies and control measures to contain the disease.

The mucin MUC5B is an important component of the innate immune response and expression levels are associated with the MUC5B promoter polymorphism, rs35705950. The high expressing T-allele of rs35705950 is an accepted risk allele for a non-infectious aging lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, given the theory of trade-offs in aging lung disease and the importance of high expression for an adequate immune response, we hypothesize that the T-allele is protective against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We collected demographics, radiology, survival data and MUC5B rs35705950 allele status for 108 patients requiring hospitalisation for COVID-19 at St Antonius Hospital in The Netherlands. For comparison of allele frequencies and allele carriership with a white control cohort, the patient cohort was divided in a white (n=83) and non-white cohort. Results The patients had a median age of 66 years and consisted predominantly of males (74%) and 23 patients (21%) died. The T-allele frequencies of rs35705950 in white patients was 0.04 which was significantly lower than the T-allele frequency of 0.10 in white controls (p= 0.02). Moreover, comparison of the number of carriers and non-carriers of the T allele showed that only 8.4% of patients carried the T-allele versus 18% of controls (p=0.029; OR= 0.41, CI=0.19-0.94). Conclusions The MUC5B rs35705950 promoter polymorphism associates with COVID-19. The risk allele (T) for IPF is protective against the development of severe COVID-19 disease. This is a further example of a trade-off between optimal expression levels in the respiratory system which associates with aging diseases. However, these results require further investigation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Coline H.M. van Moorsel","author_inst":"St Antonius Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joanne J van der Vis","author_inst":"St Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein"},{"author_name":"Claudia Benschop","author_inst":"St Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein"},{"author_name":"Henk J.T.

It is unknown, however, how these levels compare to those observed in critically ill patients with ARDS or sepsis due to other causes. Objectives: To directly compare plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, with a focus on 6 cytokines associated with cytokine storm (IL-1b, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF), between hospitalized COVID-19 patients and banked plasma samples from ARDS and sepsis patients from prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: 15 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 9 of whom were critically ill, were compared to 28 critically ill patients with ARDS or sepsis. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline levels of IL-1b, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF between patients with severe COVID-19 and critically ill controls with ARDS or sepsis. Conclusions: Levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF were not higher in critically ill COVID-19 patients than in critically ill patients admitted with ARDS or sepsis due to other causes in this small cohort.

Studies published on any date containing primary data comparing surgical facemasks and respirators specific to SARS-CoV-2, and studies underpinning government PPE guidance, were included. Appraisal was performed using CASP checklists. Results were synthesised by comparison of findings and appraisals. RESULTS In all three laboratory studies of 14 different respirators and 12 surgical facemasks, respirators were significantly more effective than facemasks in protection factors, reduction factors, filter penetrations, and total inspiratory leakages at differing particle sizes, mean inspiratory flows, and breathing rates. Tests included live viruses and inert particles on dummies and humans. In six clinical studies, 6,502 participants, there was no consistent definition of \"exposure\" to determine the efficacy of RPE. It is difficult to define \"safe\". The only statistically significant result found continuous use of respirators more effective in clinical respiratory illness compared to targeted use or surgical facemask. CONCLUSIONS There is a paucity of evidence on the comparison of FRSMs and respirators specific to SARS-CoV-2, and poor-quality evidence in other contexts. Indirectness results in extrapolation of non-SARS-CoV-2 specific data to guide UK Government PPE guidance. The appropriateness of this is unknown given the uncertainty over the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 1. The evidence base for UK Government PPE guidelines is not based on SARS-CoV-2 and requires generalisation from low-quality evidence of other pathogens\/particles. 2. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy of RPE specific to SARS-CoV-2. 3. HMG's PPE guidelines are underpinned by the assumption of droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

The age-structures of European and North American countries increase their vulnerability to covid-related deaths in general. The co-residence patterns of elderly persons in Africa and parts of Asia increase these countries' vulnerability to deaths induced by within-household transmission of covid-19. Southern European countries, which have aged populations and relatively high levels of intergenerational co-residence are, all else equal, the most vulnerable to outbreaks of covid-19. In a second step, we estimate to what extent avoiding primary infections for specific age-groups would prevent subsequent deaths due to within-household transmission of the virus.

Turkey took its place among these countries on 7th of May, 2020 by reporting SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR levels at the inlet of seven (7) major municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Istanbul [Alpaslan Kocamemi et al., 2020], which is a metropole with 15.5 million inhabitants and a very high population density (2987 persons\/km2) and having about 65 % of Covid-19 cases in Turkey. Sludges that are produced in WWTPs should be expected to contain SARS-CoV-2 virus as well. There has not yet been any study for the fate of SAR-CoV-2 in sludges generated from WWTPs. Knowledge about the existing of SARS-CoV-2 in sludge may be useful for handling the sludge during its dewatering, stabilizing and disposal processes. This information will also be valuable in case of sludges that are used as soil conditioners in agriculture or sent to landfill disposal. In wastewater treatment plants, generally two different types of sludges are generated; primary sludge (PS) and waste activated sludge (WAS). PS forms during the settling of wastewater by gravity in the primary settling tanks. Little decomposition occurs during primary sludge formation. Since most of the inorganic part of the wastewater is removed in the earlier grit removal process, the PS consists of mainly organic material that settles. The PS is about 1-2 % solids by weight. In the biological treatment part of the WWTPs, the biomass that forms in the anaerobic, anoxic and oxic zones of the process is settled in final clarifiers by gravity and returned to the beginning of the biological process so that it is not washed off. The waste activated sludge (WAS) is the excess part of the biomass that grows in this secondary treatment process. It has to be removed from the process not to increase the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration (bacteria concentration) in the secondary process more than a fixed value. The WAS is about 0.6 - 0.9 % solids by weight. This work aims to find whether SARS-CoV-19 is present in the PS and WAS before it is dewatered and sent to anaerobic or aerobic digester processes or to thermal drying operations. For this purpose, on the 7th of May 2020, two (2) PS samples were collected from Ambarl and Tuzla WWTPs, seven (7) WAS samples were collected from Terkos, Ambarl, Atakoy I & II, Pasakoy II, Buyukcekmece and Tuzla I WWTPs. Polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) adsorption [Wu et al., 2020] SARS-Cov-2 concentration method was used for SARS-CoV-2 concentration after optimization. [Alpaslan Kocamemi et al., 2020]. Real time RT-PCR diagnostic panel validated by US was used to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in primary and waste activated sludge samples taken from WWTPs in Istanbul. All samples were tested positive. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected ranging copies between 1.17E4 to 4.02x104 per liter.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bilge Alpaslan Kocamemi","author_inst":"Marmara University"},{"author_name":"Halil Kurt","author_inst":"Saglik Bilimleri University"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Sait","author_inst":"Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Republic of Turkey"},{"author_name":"Fahriye Sarac","author_inst":"Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Republic of Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Mete Saatci","author_inst":"Turkish Water Institute"},{"author_name":"Bekir Pakdemirli","author_inst":"Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry"},{"author_name":"Laura Luebbert","author_inst":"California Institution of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sriram Kosuri","author_inst":"Octant Inc.; University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Lior Pachter","author_inst":"California Institution of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yael Rosenberg-Hasson","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Holden T Maecker","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Susan P Holmes","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Joseph E Levitt","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20099739","rel_title":"Progression, recovery and fatality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","rel_date":"2020-05-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20099739","rel_abs":"Objectives To determine the case fatality rates and death risk factors. Design Retrospective case series. Setting A COVID-19 ward of a secondary Hospital in Wuhan, China. Participants Consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients between Jan 3, 2020 and Feb 27, 2020. Outcomes were followed up to discharge or death. Results Of 121 patients included, 66 (54.6%) were males. The median age was 59 (IQR: 46 to 67) years, and hypertension (33 patients; 27.3%) the leading comorbidity. Lymphopenia (83 of 115 patients; 72.2%) frequently occurred and then normalized on day 4 (IQR: 3 to 6) after admission in the survivors, with lung lesion absorbed gradually on day 8 (IQR: 6 to10) after onset (33 of 57 patients; 57.9%). The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for SARS-CoV-2 were positive in 78 (78\/108; 72.2%) patients, and a false-negative RT-PCR occurred in 15 (13.9%) patients. Hypoxemia occurred in 94 (94\/117; 80.3%) patients, and supplemental oxygen was given in 88 (72.7%) patients, and mon-invasive or invasive ventilation in 20 (16.5%) cases. Corticosteroid use might link to death. The case fatality rates were 4.4% (one of 23 patients), 29.3% (12\/41), 22.8% (13\/57) or 45% (9\/20) for patients with moderate, severe, critical illness or on ventilator. The length of hospital stay was 14 (IQR: 10 to 20) days, and selfcare ability worsened in 21 patients (21\/66; 31.8%) cases. Patients over 60 years were most likely to have poorer outcomes, and increasing in age by one-year increased risk for death by 18% (CI: 1.04-1.32). Conclusions In management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, especially the elderly with hypertension, close monitoring and appropriate supportive treatment should be taken earlier and aggressively to prevent from developing severe or critical illness. Corticosteroid use might link to death. Repeated RT-PCR tests or novel detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 should be adopted to improve diagnostic efficiency.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hua Wang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Southern Medical University Zhujiang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yirong Lu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Southern Medical University Zhujiang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingquan Lv","author_inst":"Department of Medical Affairs, Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiping Wu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Southern Medical University Zhujiang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian Hu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Southern Medical University Zhujiang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yumei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuhai Hu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lan Yu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hexuan Fei","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Ba","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Southern Medical University Zhujiang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Lin","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Southern Medical University Zhujiang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joseph E Levitt","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20099416","rel_title":"DERIVATION OF A SCORE TO PREDICT ADMISSION TO INTENSIVE CARE UNIT IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19: THE ABC-GOALS SCORE","rel_date":"2020-05-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20099416","rel_abs":"Background. COVID-19 pandemic poses a burden on hospital resources and intensive care unit (ICU) occupation. This study aimed to provide a scoring system that, assessed upon first-contact evaluation at the emergency department, predicts the need for ICU admission. Methods. We prospectively assessed patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City between March 16th and May 21st, and split them into development and validation cohorts. Patients were segregated into a group that required admission to ICU, and a group that never required ICU admission and was discharged from hospitalization. By logistic regression, we constructed predictive models for ICU admission, including clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings from the emergency department evaluation. The ABC-GOALS score was created by assigning values to the weighted odd ratios. The score was compared to other COVID-19 and pneumonia scores through the area under the curve (AUC). Results. We included 569 patients divided into development (n=329) and validation (n=240) cohorts. One-hundred-fifteen patients from each cohort required admission to ICU. The clinical model (ABC-GOALSc) included sex, obesity, the Charlson comorbidity index, dyspnea, arterial pressure, and respiratory rate at triage evaluation. The clinical plus laboratory model (ABC-GOALScl) added serum albumin, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, and S\/F ratio to the clinical model. The model that included imaging (ABC-GOALSclx) added the CT scan finding of >50% lung involvement. The model AUC were 0.79 (95%CI 0.74-0.83) and 0.77 (95%CI 0.71-0.83), 0.86 (95%CI 0.82-0.90) and 0.87 (95%CI 0.83-0.92), 0.88 (95%CI 0.84-0.92) and 0.86 (95%CI 0.81-0.90) for the clinical, laboratory and imaging models in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The ABC-GOALScl and ABC-GOALSclx scores outperformed other COVID-19 and pneumonia-specific scores. Conclusion. The ABC-GOALS score is a tool to evaluate patients with COVID-19 at admission to the emergency department, which allows to timely predict their risk of admission to an ICU.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan M.

Data including demographics, COVID-19 severity, patient outcome, and the incidence and degree of olfactory and\/or gustatory dysfunction were collected and analyzed. The Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used to quantify olfactory and gustatory dysfunction respectively. All subjects at one hospital (Shanghai) without subjective olfactory complaints underwent objective testing. Results: Of 394 screened subjects, 161 (41%) reported olfactory and\/or gustatory dysfunction and were included. Incidence of olfactory and\/or gustatory disorders in Chinese (n=239), German (n=39) and French (n=116) cohorts were 32%, 69%, and 49% 138 respectively. The median age of included subjects was 39 years old, 92\/161 (57%) were male, and 10\/161 (6%) were children. Of included subjects, 10% had only olfactory or gustatory symptoms, and 19% had olfactory and\/or gustatory complaints prior to any other COVID-19 symptom. Of subjects with objective olfactory testing, 10\/90 demonstrated abnormal chemosensory function despite reporting normal subjective olfaction. 43% (44\/102) of subjects with follow-up showed symptomatic improvement in olfaction or gustation. Conclusions: Olfactory and\/or gustatory disorders may represent early or isolated symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. They may serve as a useful additional screening criterion, particularly for the identification of patients in the early stages of infection.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chenghao Qiu","author_inst":"Center of Stomatology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China."},{"author_name":"Chong Cui","author_inst":"ENT Institute and Otorhinolaryngology Department of the Affiliated Eye and ENT Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, Institutes of Biomedical "},{"author_name":"Charlotte Hautefort","author_inst":"Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Hopital Lariboisiere, University of Paris, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Antje Haehner","author_inst":"Smell and Taste Clinic, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jun Zhao","author_inst":"Center of Pediatrics, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China."},{"author_name":"Qi Yao","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascularology, The Third People Hospital of Shenzhen, 29 Bulan Road, Longgang District, Shenzhen, 518112, China."},{"author_name":"Eric J.

The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less dangerous. The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the peripheral airways. Coughing into a tissue or cloth even at home in order to absorb the emitted aerosol is highly recommended to avoid the continuous re-inhalation of own cough.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bal\u00e1zs G.

We applied high-throughput genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to 75% of cases in the State of Victoria (population 6.24 million) in Australia. METHODS: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected through active case finding and contact tracing. A dedicated SARS-CoV-2 multidisciplinary genomic response team was formed to enable rapid integration of epidemiological and genomic data. Phylodynamic analysis was performed to assess the putative impact of social restrictions. RESULTS: Between 25 January and 14 April 2020, 1,333 COVID-19 cases were reported in Victoria, with a peak in late March. After applying internal quality control parameters, 903 samples were included in genomic analyses. Sequenced samples from Australia were representative of the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2, consistent with epidemiological findings of multiple importations and limited onward transmission. In total, 76 distinct genomic clusters were identified; these included large clusters associated with social venues, healthcare facilities and cruise ships. Sequencing of sequential samples from 98 patients revealed minimal intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity. Phylodynamic modelling indicated a significant reduction in the effective viral reproductive number (Re) from 1.63 to 0.48 after the implementation of travel restrictions and population-level physical distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a comprehensive framework for the use of SARS-CoV-2 genomics in public health responses. The application of genomics to rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains will become critically important as social restrictions ease globally. Public health responses to emergent cases must be swift, highly focused and effective.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Torsten Seemann","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Courtney Lane","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Norelle Sherry","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Duchene","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Anders Goncalves da Silva","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Leon Caly","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Michelle Sait","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Susan A Ballard","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Kristy Horan","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark B Schultz","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Tuyet Hoang","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Marion Easton","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Sally Dougall","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Tim Stinear","author_inst":"University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Julian Druce","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"mike Catton","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Brett Sutton","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Annaliese van Diemen","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Charles Alpren","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Deborah Williamson","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Howden","author_inst":"University of Melbourne at the Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"James C.

Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the evidence available at LitCovid, until March 23th, 2020, and selected articles that reported the prevalence of socio-demographic characteristics, symptoms and co-morbidities in adults with COVID-19. Results: In total, 1 572 publications were published on LitCovid. We have included 56 articles in our analysis, with 89% conducted in China, and 75% contained inpatients. Three studies were conducted in North America and one in Europe. Participants age ranged from 28 to 70 years, with balanced gender distribution. Proportion of asymptomatic cases were from 2 to 79%. The most common reported symptoms were fever [4-99%], cough [4-92%], dyspnoea\/shortness of breath [1-90%], fatigue 4-89%], myalgia [3-65%], and pharyngalgia [2-61%], while regarding co-morbidities we found cardiovascular disease [1-40%], hypertension [0-40%] and cerebrovascular disease [1-40%]. Such heterogeneity impairs the conduction of meta-analysis. Conclusions: The infection by COVID-19 seems to affect people in a very diverse manner and with different characteristics. With the available data it is not possible to clearly identify those at higher risk of being infected with this condition. Furthermore, the evidence from countries other than China is, at the day, too scarce.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniela Ferreira-Santos","author_inst":"FMUP"},{"author_name":"Priscila Maranhao","author_inst":"CINTESIS"},{"author_name":"Matilde Monteiro-Soares","author_inst":"FMUP MEDCIDS & CINTESIS"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Duchene","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Anders Goncalves da Silva","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Leon Caly","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Michelle Sait","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Susan A Ballard","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Kristy Horan","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark B Schultz","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Tuyet Hoang","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Marion Easton","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Sally Dougall","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Tim Stinear","author_inst":"University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Julian Druce","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"mike Catton","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Brett Sutton","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Annaliese van Diemen","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Charles Alpren","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Deborah Williamson","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Howden","author_inst":"University of Melbourne at the Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"James C.

DESIGN Multicenter, retrospective cohort study. SETTING Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital, and Tongji Hosptial in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS A pooled derivation cohort of 1008 COVID-19 patients from Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital in Wuhan and an external validation cohort of 1031 patients from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality, treating discharged alive from hospital as the competing event. Fine-Gray models, using backward elimination for inclusion of predictor variables and allowing non-linear effects of continuous variables, were used to derive a prognostic model for predicting in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. Internal validation was implemented to check model overfitting using bootstrap approach. External validation to a separate hospital was implemented to evaluate the generalizability of the model. RESULTS The derivation cohort was a case-mix of mild-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=1008, 43.6% females, median age 55). The final model (PLANS), including five predictor variables of platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex, had an excellent predictive performance (optimism-adjusted C-index: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.87; averaged calibration slope: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.08). Internal validation showed little overfitting. External validation using an independent cohort (n=1031, 47.8% female, median age 63) demonstrated excellent predictive performance (C-index: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.89; calibration slope: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.12). The averaged predicted survival curves were close to the observed survival curves across patients with different risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS The PLANS model based on the five routinely collected demographic and clinical characteristics (platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex) showed excellent discriminative and calibration accuracy in predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. This prognostic model would assist clinicians in better triaging patients and allocating healthcare resources to reduce COVID-19 fatality.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiong Li","author_inst":"Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuntao Chen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Shujing Chen","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Sihua Wang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dingyu Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease, Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Junfeng Wang","author_inst":"Julius Center for Health Science and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Douwe Postmus","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Hesong Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Guoyou Qin","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, and The Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety of Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Eye Center, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jinjun Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yongfu Yu","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, and The Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety of Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Sally Dougall","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Tim Stinear","author_inst":"University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Julian Druce","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"mike Catton","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Brett Sutton","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Annaliese van Diemen","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Charles Alpren","author_inst":"Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Government of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Deborah Williamson","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at The Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Howden","author_inst":"University of Melbourne at the Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"James C.

It is known that exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8+ T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. With the aim to improve the knowledge in this area, we developed a cross-sectional study, in which we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy control individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8+ T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our results suggest that inflammatory transitional and non-classical monocytes preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19. CD1c+ conventional dendritic cells also followed this pattern, whereas CD141+ conventional and CD123hi plasmacytoid dendritic cells were depleted from blood but were absent in the lungs.

In addition, general alterations in metabolism can provide key understanding of pathogenesis. However, little is known about the specific metabolic effects of SARS-COV-2 infection. The present study evaluated the serum metabolism of COVID-19 patients (n=33), identified by a positive nucleic acid test of a nasopharyngeal swab, as compared to COVID-19-negative control patients (n=16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses specifically identified alterations in the metabolism of tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, which is well-known to be involved in regulating inflammation and immunity. Indeed, the observed changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Metabolomics analysis also confirmed widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism in infected patients, with decreased circulating levels of most amino acids, except for tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway, and increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and kidney dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis in COVID-19 patients. Metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation and disease severity (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen). In conclusion, this initial observational study of the metabolic consequences of COVID-19 infection in a clinical cohort identified amino acid metabolism (especially kynurenine and cysteine\/taurine) and fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiffany Thomas","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Davide Stefanoni","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Julie A Reisz","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Travis Nemkov","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Bertolone","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Richard O Francis","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Krystalyn E Hudson","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"James C Zimring","author_inst":"University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kirk C Hansen","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Eldad A Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven L Spitalnik","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Angelo D'Alessandro","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana del Campo Guerola","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Calzada","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"Rheumatology Service from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa and Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Joan B Soriano","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Julio Ancochea","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Hongmeng Yu","author_inst":"ENT Institute and Otorhinolaryngology Department of the Affiliated Eye and ENT Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, Institutes of Biomedical "},{"author_name":"Adrien A.

The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for data scientists to model COVID-19, when the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 are yet to be fully explained. The uncertainty around the COVID-19 with no vaccine and effective medicine available until today create additional pressure on the epidemiologists and policy makers. In such a crucial situation, it is very important to predict infected cases to support prevention of the disease and aid in the preparation of healthcare service. In this paper, we have tried to understand the spreading capability of COVID-19 in India taking into account of the lockdown period. The numbers of confirmed cases are increased in India and states in the past few weeks. A differential equation based simple model has been used to understand the pattern of COVID-19 in India and some states. Our findings suggest that the physical distancing and lockdown strategies implemented in India are successfully reducing the spread and that the tempo of pandemic growth has slowed in recent days.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brijesh P Singh","author_inst":"Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi INDIA"},{"author_name":"Gunjan Singh","author_inst":"Amity University, Lucknow"},{"author_name":"Takayoshi Shimohata","author_inst":"Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masahito Kobayashi","author_inst":"Yokohama National University"},{"author_name":"Masashi Idogawa","author_inst":"Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hideyuki Hayashi","author_inst":"Osaka Medical College"},{"author_name":"Krystalyn E Hudson","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"James C Zimring","author_inst":"University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kirk C Hansen","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Eldad A Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven L Spitalnik","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Angelo D'Alessandro","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana del Campo Guerola","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Calzada","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"Rheumatology Service from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa and Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Joan B Soriano","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Julio Ancochea","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Hongmeng Yu","author_inst":"ENT Institute and Otorhinolaryngology Department of the Affiliated Eye and ENT Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, Institutes of Biomedical "},{"author_name":"Adrien A.

SARS-CoV-2 infection has widely spread to the hugest public health challenge to date, COVID-19 pandemic. Different fatality rates among countries are probably due to non-standardized records being carried out by local health authorities. Spanish case-fatality rate is 11.94%, far higher to those reported in Asia or by other European countries. A multicenter retrospective study was performed of demographic, clinical, laboratory and immunological features of 574 Spanish COVID-19 hospitalized patients and their outcomes. The use of use of renin-angiotensin system blockers was also analyzed as a risk factor. Results. In this study, 27.7% of cases presented a mild curse, 42% a moderate one and for 30.3% of cases, the course was severe. Ages ranged from 18 to 98 (average 63.2). Fifty eight percent (58.9%) of patients were male. Interleukin 6 was higher as severity increased. On the other hand, CD8 lymphocyte count was significantly lower as severity grew and subpopulations CD4, CD8, CD19 and NK showed concordant lowering trends. Severity-related natural killer percent descents were evidenced just within aged cases. A significant severity-related decrease of CD4 lymphocytes was found in males. The use of renin-angiotensin system blockers was associated with moderate or mild disease courses. Conclusions. Age and age-related comorbidities, such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension or diabetes, determined more frequent severe forms of the disease in this study than in previous literature cohorts. Our cases are older than those so far reported and clinical course of the disease is found to be impaired by age. Immunosenescence might be therefore a suitable explanation for immune system effectors severity-related hampering. Adaptive immunity would go exhausted and a huge ineffective and almost deleterious innate response would account for COVID-19 severity. Renin-angiotensin system blockers treatment in hypertensive patients has a protective effect as regarding COVID-19 severity.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aurora Jurado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia"},{"author_name":"M Carmen Martin","author_inst":"Centro de Hemoterapia y Hemodonacion de Castilla y Leon"},{"author_name":"Cristina Abad-Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valladolid"},{"author_name":"Antonio Orduna","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valladolid"},{"author_name":"Alba Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen"},{"author_name":"Esther Ocana","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen"},{"author_name":"Oscar Yarce","author_inst":"Hospital Reina Sofia"},{"author_name":"Ana M Navas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Trujillo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Pereira","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Esther Vergara","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez"},{"author_name":"Bibiana Quirant","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Eva Martinez-Caceres","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Manuel Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Janire Perurena","author_inst":"Hospital universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Juana Gil","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Sergi Cantenys","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Gema Gonzalez-Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil,"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Martinez-Saavedra","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rojo","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de a Coruna"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marco","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Sergio Mora","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Jesus Ontanon","author_inst":"Hospital general universitario de Albacete"},{"author_name":"Marcos Lopez-Hoyos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Ocejo-Vinyals","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Josefa Melero","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.095133","rel_title":"Identification of conserved epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein.","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.095133","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first occurred in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, is a novel virus that causes a severe acute respiratory disease. The virus spike glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins are the main targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, to control the disease spread. We herein study the structural order-disorder propensity and the rates of evolution of these two proteins to characterize their B cell and T cell epitopes, previously suggested to contribute to immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections. We first analyzed the rates of evolution along the sequences of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in relation to the spatial locations of their epitopes. For this purpose, we compared orthologs from seven human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. We then focus on the local, structural order-disorder propensities of the protein regions where the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes are located. We show that the vast majority of nucleocapsid protein epitopes overlap the RNA-binding and dimerization domains and some of them are characterized by low rates of evolutions. Similarly, spike protein epitopes are preferentially located in regions that are predicted to be ordered and well-conserved, in correspondence of the heptad repeats 1 and 2. Interestingly, both the receptor-binding motif to ACE2 and the fusion peptide of spike protein are characterized by high rates of evolution, probably to overcome host immunity. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for conserved epitopes that may help to develop long-lasting, broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergio Forcelloni","author_inst":"University of Rome \"La Sapienza\""},{"author_name":"Anna Benedetti","author_inst":"University of Rome \"La Sapienza\""},{"author_name":"Maddalena Dilucca","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giansanti","author_inst":"Sapienza Universita di Roma"},{"author_name":"Alba Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen"},{"author_name":"Esther Ocana","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen"},{"author_name":"Oscar Yarce","author_inst":"Hospital Reina Sofia"},{"author_name":"Ana M Navas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Trujillo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Pereira","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Esther Vergara","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez"},{"author_name":"Bibiana Quirant","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Eva Martinez-Caceres","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Manuel Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Janire Perurena","author_inst":"Hospital universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Juana Gil","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Sergi Cantenys","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Gema Gonzalez-Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil,"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Martinez-Saavedra","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rojo","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de a Coruna"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marco","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Sergio Mora","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Jesus Ontanon","author_inst":"Hospital general universitario de Albacete"},{"author_name":"Marcos Lopez-Hoyos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Ocejo-Vinyals","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Josefa Melero","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.095885","rel_title":"Predicting the Immunogenicity of T cell epitopes: From HIV to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.095885","rel_abs":"We describe a physics-based learning model for predicting the immunogenicity of Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes derived from diverse pathogens, given a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genotype. The model was trained and tested on experimental data on the relative immunodominance of CTL epitopes in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. The method is more accurate than publicly available models. Our model predicts that only a fraction of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that have been predicted to bind to HLA molecules is immunogenic. The immunogenic CTL epitopes across all SARS-CoV-2 proteins are predicted to provide broad population coverage, but the immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone are unlikely to do so. Our model predicts that several immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 CTL epitopes are identical to those contained in low-pathogenicity coronaviruses circulating in the population. Thus, we suggest that some level of CTL immunity against COVID-19 may be present in some individuals prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ang Gao","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhilin Chen","author_inst":"Ragon Insitute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Mary Carrington","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Arup K.

Stochasticity in transmission within and between countries and\/or actual advantage in virus transmissibility could explain the high frequency reached by some genomic variants during the course of the outbreak.\n\nUsing a suite of statistical, population genetics, and theoretical approaches, we show that the globally most represented spike protein variant (i.e., the G clade, A [-&gt;] G nucleotide change at genomic position 23,403; D [-&gt;] G amino acid change at spike protein position 614) i) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects or enhanced pathogenicity; ii) affects the spike S1\/S2 furin-like site increasing its conformational plasticity (short range effect), and iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect).\n\nOur study unambiguously links the spread of the G614 with a non-random process, and we hypothesize that this process is related to the selective advantage produced by a specific structural modification of the spike protein. We conclude that the different conformation of the S1\/S2 proteolytic site is at the basis of the higher transmission rate of this invasive SARS-CoV-2 variant, and provide structural information to guide the design of selective and efficient drugs.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emiliano Trucchi","author_inst":"Department of Life and Environmental Science, Marche Polytechnic University, Via Brecce Bianche, 60131, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paolo Gratton","author_inst":"Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Cracovia, 1, 00133, Roma, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Mafessoni","author_inst":"Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Deutscher Platz, 6, 04103, Leipzig, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefano Motta","author_inst":"Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, Piazza della Scienza 2, 20126, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Cicconardi","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Bertorelle","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Via Luigi Borsari 46, 44121, Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Di Marino","author_inst":"Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, New York-Marche Structural Biology Center (NY-MaSBiC), Polytechnic University of Marche, Via Brecce Bianche, 6013"},{"author_name":"Ana M Navas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Trujillo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Pereira","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Esther Vergara","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez"},{"author_name":"Bibiana Quirant","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Eva Martinez-Caceres","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Manuel Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Janire Perurena","author_inst":"Hospital universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Juana Gil","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Sergi Cantenys","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Gema Gonzalez-Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil,"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Martinez-Saavedra","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rojo","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de a Coruna"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marco","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Sergio Mora","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Jesus Ontanon","author_inst":"Hospital general universitario de Albacete"},{"author_name":"Marcos Lopez-Hoyos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Ocejo-Vinyals","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Josefa Melero","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"}]}
