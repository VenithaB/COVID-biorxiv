We assessed the relationship between aggregated mobility data collected from mobile phone users and the time-dependent reproduction number R(t), using severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases reported by Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. We found that the proportion of individuals staying home all day (isolation index) had a strong inverse correlation with R(t) (rho<-0.7) and was predictive of COVID-19 transmissibility (p<0.0001). Furthermore, indexs of 46.7% had the highest accuracy (93.9%) to predict R(t) below one. This metric can be monitored in real time to assess adherence to social distancing measures and predict their effectiveness for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvano B de Oliveira","author_inst":"National Immunization Program, Department of Immunization and Communicable Diseases, Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Victor Bertollo Gomes Porto","author_inst":"National Immunization Program, Department of Immunization and Communicable Diseases, Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Fabiana Ganem","author_inst":"National Immunization Program, Department of Immunization and Communicable Diseases, Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Fabio Macedo Mendes","author_inst":"University of Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maria Almiron","author_inst":"Panamerican Health Organization, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Wanderson Kleber de Oliveira","author_inst":"Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Francieli Fontana Sutile Tardetti Fantinato","author_inst":"National Immunization Program, Department of Immunization and Communicable Diseases, Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Walquiria Aparecida Ferreira de Almeida","author_inst":"National Immunization Program, Department of Immunization and Communicable Diseases, Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Abel Pereira de Macedo Borges","author_inst":"InLoco company"},{"author_name":"Hector Natan Batista Pinheiro","author_inst":"Inloco company"},{"author_name":"Raiza dos Santos Oliveira","author_inst":"Inloco company"},{"author_name":"Jason R Andrews","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, USA."},{"author_name":"Nuno R.

This study aims to explore splitting ventilators, or multi-ventilation, as a viable alternative in these demanding times. We investigated whether individualized tidal volume and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) delivery is possible to lungs of different compliances that are being simultaneously ventilated from one anesthesia ventilator. Methods: We performed a controlled experiment in an operating room environment without animal or human participants. Two test lungs were connected to distinct modified Y-pieces that were ventilated in parallel from a single anesthesia ventilator. Results: Ventilation can be manipulated to qualitatively deliver individually tailored tidal volumes in the setting of varying PEEP and compliance requirements in pressure control mode. Conclusions: Splitting ventilators, or multi-ventilation, is a viable alternative to acute ventilator shortage during a pandemic. Ventilators can be split for individualized tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure delivery in multiple subjects of differing compliances and demographics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert Lee","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Soban Umar","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Nir Hoftman","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"David J Clark","author_inst":"St Georges University of London"},{"author_name":"Michael Cocozza","author_inst":"Mologic"},{"author_name":"Ana I Cubas-Atienzar","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luis E Cuevas","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martina Cusinato","author_inst":"St Georges University of London"},{"author_name":"Benedict M.

We developed a strategy for overcoming this bias to obtain more plausible estimates of the true values of key epidemiological variables. We fit mechanistic Bayesian latent-variable SIR models to confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries, for all regions (countries and US states) independently. Bayesian averaging over models, we find that the raw infection incidence rate underestimates the true rate by a factor, the case ascertainment ratio CARt that depends upon region, and show how CARt changes over time. At the regional onset of COVID-19, the predicted global median for each case confirmed was 13 infections unreported (CARt = 0.07 C.I. (0.02, 0.4)). As the infection spread, the median CARt rose to 9 unreported cases for every one diagnosed as of April 15, 2020 (CARt = 0.1 C.I. (0.02, 0.5)). We also estimate that the median global initial reproduction number R0 is 3.3 (C.I (1.5, 8.3)) and the total infection fatality rate near the onset is 0.17% (C.I. (0.05%, 0.9%)). However the time-dependent reproduction number Rt and infection fatality rate as of April 15 were 1.2 (C.I. (0.6, 2.5)) and 0.8% (C.I. (0.2%,4%)), respectively. We find that there is great variability between country- and state-level values. Our estimates are consistent with recent serological estimates of cumulative infections for the state of New York, but inconsistent with claims that very large fractions of the population have already been infected in most other regions. For most regions, our estimates imply a great deal of uncertainty about the current state and trajectory of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carson C Chow","author_inst":"NIDDK, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Joshua C Chang","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Richard C Gerkin","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Shashaank Vattikuti","author_inst":"NIDDK, National Institutes of Healthj"},{"author_name":"Michael Cocozza","author_inst":"Mologic"},{"author_name":"Ana I Cubas-Atienzar","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luis E Cuevas","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martina Cusinato","author_inst":"St Georges University of London"},{"author_name":"Benedict M.

The two models are compared in terms of their predictive ability using root mean squared error and deviance information criterion. The Poisson autoregressive model that allows to capture both short and long term memory effects performs best under all criterions.

Design: Online cross-sectional survey. Setting: UK. Participants: 53,002 men and women aged [&ge;]18y. Main outcome measures: Confirmed and suspected COVID-19, worry about catching and becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, and adherence to protective behaviours. Socioeconomic position was defined according to highest level of education (post-16 qualifications: yes\/no). Results: Compared with never smokers (0.3% [95%CI 0.2-0.3%]), prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current (0.6% [0.4-0.8%]) but not ex-smokers (0.2% [0.2-0.3%]). The associations were similar before (current: OR 2.14 [1.49-3.08]; ex-smokers: OR 0.73 [0.47-1.14]) and after (current: OR 1.79 [1.22-2.62]; ex-smokers: OR 0.85 [0.54-1.33]) adjustment for potential confounders. For current smokers, this was moderated by socioeconomic position, with higher rates relative to never smokers only seen in those without post-16 qualifications (OR 3.53 [2.04-6.10]). After including suspected cases, prevalence was higher among current smokers (11.2% [10.6-11.9%], OR 1.11 [1.03-1.20]) and ex-smokers (10.9% [10.4-11.5%], OR 1.07 [1.01-1.15]) than never smokers (10.2% [9.9-10.6%]), but remained higher only among ex-smokers after adjustment (OR 1.21 [1.13-1.29]). Current and ex-smokers had higher odds than never smokers of reporting significant stress about catching (current: OR 1.43 [1.35-1.52]; ex-smokers: OR 1.15 [1.09-1.22]) or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (current: OR 1.34 [1.27-1.43]; ex-smokers: OR 1.22 [1.16-1.28]). Adherence to recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 was generally high (96.3% [96.1-96.4%]), but lower among current than never smokers (OR 0.70 [0.62-0.78]). Conclusions: When assessed by self-report in a population sample, current smoking was independently associated with confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were socioeconomic disparities, with the association only apparent among those without post-16 qualifications.

In response, severely affected countries have had to consider a range of public health strategies achieved by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: i) \"mitigation\", which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and ii) \"suppression\", aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population. Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterised to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK, we assessed the prospects of success using both of these approaches. We simulated a range of different non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios incorporating social distancing applied to differing age groups. We found that it is possible to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission if social distancing measures are sustained at a sufficient level for a period of months. Our modelling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly-defined forces. Specifically, we found that: i) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, ii) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be vary over time in a precise but unfeasible way, and iii) social distancing must be maintained for a long duration (over 6 months).","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tobias Brett","author_inst":"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Pejman Rohani","author_inst":"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Lion Shahab","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Ana I Cubas-Atienzar","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luis E Cuevas","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martina Cusinato","author_inst":"St Georges University of London"},{"author_name":"Benedict M.

There is an urgent need to create novel models to study SARS-CoV-2 using human disease-relevant cells to understand key features of virus biology and facilitate drug screening. As primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory-based, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that could be adapted for drug screens. The lung organoids, particularly aveolar type II cells, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis following SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a robust induction of chemokines and cytokines with little type I\/III interferon signaling, similar to that observed amongst human COVID-19 pulmonary infections. We performed a high throughput screen using hPSC-derived lung organoids and identified FDA-approved drug candidates, including imatinib and mycophenolic acid, as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry. Pre- or post-treatment with these drugs at physiologically relevant levels decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection of hPSC-derived lung organoids. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-derived lung cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 can model human COVID-19 disease and provide a valuable resource to screen for FDA-approved drugs that might be repurposed and should be considered for COVID-19 clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuling Han","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Liuliu Yang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Duan","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fuyu Duan","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Benjamin E.

Pressing relevance stems from the need to restart the economy dramatically affected by the lockdown. We employ a spatially explicit, data-intensive model of the patterns of disease spread in Italy, which devotes proper attention to the paramount role of inapparent infections. We aim at providing tools to: estimate the baseline trajectory, i.e. the expected unfolding of the outbreak if the current containment measures were kept in place indefinitely; assess possible deviations from the baseline, should relaxations of the current lockdown result in increased disease transmission; and estimate the isolation effort required to prevent a resurgence of the outbreak. A 40% increase in effective transmission as a result of the loosening of confinement measures would yield an epidemic curve that shows a major rebound, larger than the previous peaks in most regions. A control effort capable of isolating a daily percentage of approximately 5.5% of the exposed and highly infectious individuals proves necessary to counterbalance such an increase and maintain the epidemic curve onto the decreasing baseline trajectory. We explore several scenarios, provide the basic data to design the related control strategies, and discuss their feasibility. Should suitable control via tracing and testing prove unfeasible, stop-and-go enforcement or delay of the lockdown relaxations would be necessary to reduce the isolation effort required to maintain the epidemic trajectory under control.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enrico Bertuzzo","author_inst":"University of Venice Ca' Foscari"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mari","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Damiano Pasetto","author_inst":"University of Venice Ca' Foscari"},{"author_name":"Stefano Miccoli","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Renato Casagrandi","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Marino Gatto","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rinaldo","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Xuming Tang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tuo Zhang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zeping Zhao","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yaron Bram","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"David Redmond","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sean Houghton","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Duc Nguyen","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Dong Xu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xing Wang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Skyler Uhl","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yaoxing Huang","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jared L.

Increased lethality in men was evident in the first large reports from ChinaCDC and WHO-China, and the gender gap appeared even wider in the early Italian outbreak. Newspapers and scientific journals alike have commented on this finding and the preexisting conditions, biological processes, and gender role behavior differences that may underlie it. However, as for other diseases, and in spite of years of advocating for the collection of raw epidemiological data and the analysis of clinical trial data sets by sex, very little appeared to be released about sex differences in characteristics of the epidemics beyond infection and death rates, such as severity of disease, comorbidities, rate of recovery, length of hospital stay, or number of tests for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. These data are critical not only for scientists to understand the pathophysiology of disease, but also to inform decision-making by countries and healthcare systems on how to prioritize testing and best allocate scarce resources and relief funds. Systematic analysis of official websites for the 20 countries and 6 US states reporting the highest number of cases on March 21, 2020, revealed a wide disparity in sex-disaggregated data made available to the public and scholars. Only a handful of the countries reported cases by sex separately. None of the other characteristics, including fatality rates, were stratified by sex at the time. Beyond suboptimal sex disaggregation, our analysis found a paucity of usable raw data sets and a generalized lack of standardization of captured data, making comparisons difficult. A second round of data capture in April found more complete, but even more disparate, information. Our analysis revealed a wide range of sex ratios among confirmed cases, which changed over time. In countries where a male-biased sex ratio was initially reported, the reported proportion of women among cases dramatically increased in under 3 weeks. In contrast, men were consistently over-represented in severe cases, intensive care admissions, and deaths. We also show that the sex ratio varies with age, with a complex pattern, reproduced across the 6 countries for which data were found. Accurate, peer-reviewed, statistical analysis of harmonized, sex-disaggregated data for other characteristics of epidemics, such as availability of testing, suspected source of infection, or comorbidities will be critical to understand where the observed disparities come from and to generate evidence-based recommendations for decision-making by institutions and governments around the world.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristen M Kocher","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Arthur D\u00e9lot-Vilain","author_inst":"Georgetown Day School"},{"author_name":"D'Andre Spencer","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jonathan LoTempio","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Emmanu\u00e8le C D\u00e9lot","author_inst":"Children's National Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marino Gatto","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rinaldo","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Xuming Tang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tuo Zhang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zeping Zhao","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yaron Bram","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"David Redmond","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sean Houghton","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Duc Nguyen","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Dong Xu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xing Wang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Skyler Uhl","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yaoxing Huang","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jared L.

Results: SARS-CoV-2 localized predominantly to syncytiotrophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface of the placenta. Histological examination of the placenta revealed a dense macrophage infiltrate, but no evidence for vasculopathy typically associated with preeclampsia. Conclusion: This case demonstrates, for the first time, SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the placenta, highlighting the potential for severe morbidity among pregnant women with Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hillary Hosier","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelli Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaella Morotti","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Uma Deshmukh","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alice Lu-Culligan","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Katherine Campbell","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuki Yasumoto","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chantal Vogels","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Pavithra Vijayakumar","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bertie Geng","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Camila Odio","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Fournier","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anderson Brito","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Joseph Fauver","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Feimei Liu","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tara Alpert","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Reshef Tal","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Klara Szigeti-Buck","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sudhir Perincheri","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Larsen","author_inst":"Arkana Labs"},{"author_name":"Aileen Gariepy","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Aguilar","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kristen Fardelmann","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Malini Harigopal","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hugh Taylor","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christian Pettker","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anne Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aaron Ring","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathan Grubaugh","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tamas Horvath","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Uma Reddy","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heather Lipkind","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lance Turtle","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Chris Williams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Wilkins","author_inst":"Mologic"},{"author_name":"Kevin Woolston","author_inst":"Mologic"},{"author_name":"Amadou A Sall","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Dakar"},{"author_name":"Joseph R.A.

Using recently published deaths figures for 1,689 Italian municipalities, we estimate the growth in daily mortality rates between the period 2015-2019 and 2020 by province. All provinces that experienced a major COVID-19 shock in mid-March 2020 had increases in mortality rates of 100% or above already in early February 2020. This increase was particularly strong for males and older people, two recognizable features of COVID-19. Using a panel fixed effect model, we show that the association between these early increases in mortality for any cause and the March 2020 COVID-19 shock is strong and significant.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the critical enzyme for SARS-CoV-2 infection, is broadly expressed in many organs including heart. However, the cellular distribution of ACE2 in the human heart, particularly the failing heart is unknown. Methods: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in both normal and failing hearts, and characterized the ACE2 gene expression profile in various cell subsets, especially in cardiomyocyte subsets, as well as its interaction with gene networks relating to various defense and immune responses at the single cell level. Results: The results demonstrated that ACE2 is present in cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in the heart, while the number of ACE2-postive (ACE2+) CMs and ACE2 gene expression in these CMs are significantly increased in the failing hearts. Interestingly, both brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are significantly up-regulated in the ACE2+ CMs. Further analysis shows that ANP, BNP and ACE2 may form a negative feedback loop with a group of genes associated with the development of heart failure. To our surprise, we found that genes related to virus entry, virus replication and suppression of interferon-gamma signaling are all up-regulated in CMs in failing hearts, and the increases were significantly higher in ACE2+ CMs as compared with ACE2 negative (ACE2-) CMs, suggesting that these ACE2+ CMs may be more vulnerable to virus infection. Since ACE2 expression is correlated with BNP expression, we further performed retrospective analysis of the plasma BNP levels and clinic outcome of 91 COVID-19 patients from a single-center. Patients with higher plasma BNP were associated with significantly higher mortality rate and expression levels of inflammatory and infective markers such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Conclusion: In the failing heart, the upregulation of ACE2 and virus infection associated genes, as well as the increased expression of ANP and BNP could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and replication in these vulnerable cardiomyocyte subsets. These findings may advance our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of myocarditis associated with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaojiang Xu","author_inst":"NIEHS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Dachun Xu","author_inst":"Tongji University School of Medicine,PR.

We evaluated risk for COVID-19 among frontline HCWs compared to the general community and the influence of PPE. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of the general community, including frontline HCWs, who reported information through the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application beginning on March 24 (United Kingdom, U.K.) and March 29 (United States, U.S.) through April 23, 2020. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of a positive COVID-19 test. Findings: Among 2,035,395 community individuals and 99,795 frontline HCWs, we documented 5,545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34,435,272 person-days. Compared with the general community, frontline HCWs had an aHR of 11.6 (95% CI: 10.9 to 12.3) for reporting a positive test. The corresponding aHR was 3.40 (95% CI: 3.37 to 3.43) using an inverse probability weighted Cox model adjusting for the likelihood of receiving a test. A symptom-based classifier of predicted COVID-19 yielded similar risk estimates. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE, the aHRs for reporting a positive test were 1.46 (95% CI: 1.21 to 1.76) for those reporting PPE reuse and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.56) for reporting inadequate PPE. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE who did not care for COVID-19 patients, HCWs caring for patients with documented COVID-19 had aHRs for a positive test of 4.83 (95% CI: 3.99 to 5.85) if they had adequate PPE, 5.06 (95% CI: 3.90 to 6.57) for reused PPE, and 5.91 (95% CI: 4.53 to 7.71) for inadequate PPE. Interpretation: Frontline HCWs had a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 infection, highest among HCWs who reused PPE or had inadequate access to PPE. However, adequate supplies of PPE did not completely mitigate high-risk exposures.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Long H.

It requires weather (environmental) factors to be included in prediction models, but there are few models to achieve it successfully. In this study, we proposed a new concept of environmental infection rate (RE), based on floating time of respiratory droplets in the air and inactivation rate of virus to solve the problem. More than half of the particles in the droplets can float in the atmosphere for 1-2 hours. The prediction results showed that high RE values (>3.5) are scattered around 30N in winter (Dec.-Feb.). As the weather warms, its distribution area expands and extends to higher latitudes of northern hemisphere, reaching its maximum in April, and then shrinking northward. These indicated that the spread of COVID-19 in most parts of the northern hemisphere is expected to decline after Apr., but the risks in high latitudes will remain high in May. In the south of southern hemisphere, the RE values tend to subside from Apr. to July. The high modeled RE values up to July, however, suggested that warmer weather will not stop COVID-19 from spreading. Public health intervention is needed to overcome the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Xiao","author_inst":"East China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Renguo Zhu","author_inst":"East China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Chengxing Sun","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Liu","author_inst":"East China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Huayun Xiao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Daniel R.

Limitation of the pandemic is mainly facilitated by reducing infections. An effective strategy is social distancing. However, this strategy draws more and more criticism, in Germany as elsewhere, because of its economic and psychological consequences for society. How can the number of infected person be held below the medical care capacity while restrictions affecting the general public are minimized? Various approaches exist to retarding the infection rate during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak until vaccine has been developed, without overloading medical capacity. Options being discussed include large-scale testing, contact tracing and social distancing. A study published by the Imperial College contains a model calculation of the effects of alternating school closings and openings in the United States and the United Kingdom. However, no satisfactory solution was developed. Variables which describe the medical care resources in Germany and the age and occupational structure of its population contrast sharply with American and British conditions. This study attempts to apply the Imperial College approach of alternating quarantine and normal episodes for the entire population. Mathematically, an oscillation in hospitalization can be imposed. The difficulty lies in determining the non-controllable parameters related to the virus. Varying the ambiguously quantified input variables is investigated in an attempt to devise a strategy for all combinations that does not overload the clinical system.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carolin Knoch","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Xiao","author_inst":"East China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Renguo Zhu","author_inst":"East China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Chengxing Sun","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Liu","author_inst":"East China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Huayun Xiao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Daniel R.

To date, however, no large sample size study focusing on gastrointestinal symptoms in pediatric cases has been published. We analyzed COVID-19 infected children in Wuhan who presented with initial GI symptoms to determine the GI characteristics and epidemiological trend of the disease. Design: We retrospectively analyzed 244 children patients confirmed with COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital from 21 Jan to 20 Mar 2020. Symptomatic cases were divided into two groups according to whether the patients presented with or without GI symptoms on admission. Demographic, epidemiological, symptoms, and laboratory data were compared. We also analyzed the respective trends of case number changes of GI cases and asymptomatic cases. Results: 34 out of 193 symptomatic children had GI symptoms. They had lower median age and weight, a higher rate of fever, a longer length of stay and more hematological and biochemical abnormalities than patients without GI symptoms. There was no significant difference in chest CT findings or stool SARS-CoV-2 test positive percentages between the two groups. The number of patients admitted with GI symptoms showed an overall downward trend with time. At the time of writing, 242 patients were discharged, one died, and one critically ill patient was still in the intensive care unit. Conclusion: COVID-19 infected children with GI symptoms are prone to presenting with more clinical and laboratory abnormalities than patients without GI symptoms. More attention and timely hospital admission are needed for these patients.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoli Xiong","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenenth Kak-Yuen Wong","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shuiqing Chi","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Aifen Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianqiao Tang","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lishan Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ho-yu Chung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gilbert Chua","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Keith TS Tung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ian CK Wong","author_inst":"The Univeristy of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Celine SL Chui","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xue Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Mike Yat-wah Kwan","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wilfred HS Wong","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marco Hok-kung Ho","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Godfrey CF Chan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Cao","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Kang Li","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ip","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peng Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaotao Tang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Paul KH Tam","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Mark Graham","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carol H.

Little is known about COVID-19 testing rates and COVID-19 test outcomes in people with mental illness. We hypothesized that people with psychiatric disorders are less likely to undergo COVID-19 testing and more likely to test positive. Methods We used data on COVID-19 testing in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort to compare the prevalence of COVID-19 testing and test outcomes among individuals with psychiatric disorders to those without such diagnoses. We further investigated associations of testing probability and outcome with psychiatric diagnostic categories. Outcomes Individuals with psychiatric disorders were overrepresented among the 1 474 UKB participants with test data: 23% of the COVID-19 test sample had a psychiatric diagnosis compared to 10% in the full cohort (p<0.0001). This overrepresentation persisted for each of the specific psychiatric disorders tested. Furthermore, individuals with a psychiatric disorder (p=0.01), particularly with substance use disorder (p<0.005), had negative test results significantly more often than individuals without psychiatric disorders. Sensitivity analyses confirmed our results. Interpretation In contrast with our hypotheses, UKB participants with psychiatric disorders have been tested for COVID-19 more frequently than individuals without a psychiatric history, pleading against the notion that limited health care access is preventing them from undergoing testing. Among those tested, test outcomes were more frequently negative for UKB participants with psychiatric disorders than in others, countering arguments that people with mental illness are more prone to contract the virus. Funding No external funding sources participated in any stage of the present study.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dennis van der Meer","author_inst":"NORMENT, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital & Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Justo Emilio Pinzon-Espinosa","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Institute of Neuroscience, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Bochao Danae Lin","author_inst":"Department of Translational Neuroscience, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Joeri K.

This study uses all-cause daily death registrations data provided by the Italian Statistical Office (ISTAT) focusing on the five most severely hit provinces in Italy (Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lodi and Piacenza) and Lombardy region. We calculate excess mortality in 2020 compared to the average of the years 2015-2019 and estimate life expectancy for the first wave of the epidemic and for the rest of the year 2020. The estimated excess deaths show significantly higher mortality than official statistics, particularly during the peak of the epidemic and amongst people aged [&ge;]70 years. For the first wave of the epidemic (1 January to 30 April 2020), life expectancy in the five provinces reduced by 6.2 to 8 and 3.6 to 5.8 years for men and women, respectively. For annual life expectancy in 2020, with regular after-COVID mortality patterns, the years of life lost is equivalent to 2.5 to 4.1 years for men and 1.7. to 2.6 years for women, respectively.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simone Ghislandi","author_inst":"Bocconi University"},{"author_name":"Raya Muttarak","author_inst":"Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (Univ.

This paper sheds light on the preparedness of the healthcare system by examining the spatial distribution of isolation beds across districts and divisions, forecasting the number of ICU units that may be required in the short term and analyzing the availability of frontline healthcare workers to combat the pandemic. As of May 2, COVID-19 cases have been found in 61 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh with Dhaka District being the epicenter. Seventy-one percent of the cases have been identified in 6 neighboring districts, namely, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi, Munsiganj and Kishoreganj, which appear to form a spatial cluster. However, if one takes into account the population at risk, the prevalence appears to be highest in Dhaka, followed by Narayanganj, Gazipur, Kishorganj, Narsingdi and Munshiganj. These regions may therefore be flagged as the COVID-19 hotspots in Bangladesh. Among the eight divisions, prevalence is highest in Dhaka Division followed by Mymensingh. The number of cases per million exceeds the number of available isolation beds per million in the major hotspots indicating that there is a risk of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed should the number of cases rise. This is especially true for Dhaka Division, where the ratio of COVID-19 patients to doctors appears to be alarmingly high. Mymensingh Division also has a disproportionately small number of doctors relative to the number of COVID-19 patients. Using second order polynomial regression, the analysis predicts that even if all ICU beds are allocated to COVID-19 patients, Bangladesh may run out of ICU beds soon after May 15, 2020. We conclude that in spite of a significant increase in hospital capacity during 2005-15 and a 57 % rise in the number of doctors during the same period, the healthcare system in Bangladesh and Dhaka Division in particular, may not be fully prepared to handle the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, further steps need to be taken to flatten the curve and improve healthcare capacity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasinur Rahaman Khan","author_inst":"ISRT, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tamanna Howlader","author_inst":"ISRT, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

There are likely a number of factors one can attribute to such disparity, not least of which is differing healthcare models and approaches. Here, we examine the COVID-19 related health advice issued by six different countries, specifically examining the patient-led triage pathways in each country. Methods: A simulation study was conducted on current, nationwide, patient-led triage systems from three countries with low case fatality rates (Singapore, Norway and Japan) and two countries with high case fatality rates (the USA and the UK). Cases were simulated by clinicians to approximate typical COVID-19 presentations (mild, severe and critical), and COVID-19 mimickers (sepsis, bacterial pneumonia). The same simulations were applied to each of the five countrys patient-led triage systems, and the recommendations to refer on for medical care or to advise to stay at home were recorded and compared. Statistical analysis examined the potential correlation between triage outcomes and case fatality rates. Results: Patient-led triage systems from Singapore, Japan and Norway maintained a low threshold for advising clinical contact for patients with possible COVID-19 (88 to 100% of cases were referred). Patient-led triage systems from the USA and the UK maintained high thresholds for advising contact with either call centre support or clinical contact (28 and 33% of cases were referred, respectively), and triaged the majority of cases home with no further healthcare input. There was a strong inverse correlation between percentage of cases referred and the nations case fatality rate (Pearsons Correlation = -0.642, p = 0.01). Conclusion: In this simulation study, the triage algorithms of Singapore, Norway and Japan successfully identified severe COVID-19 and triaged such cases to medical care. The USA triage system and the UKs triage system performed poorly, failing to identify severe COVID-19 infection and sepsis. In this study, the performance of national COVID-19 triage systems strongly correlate with case fatality rates.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatma Mansab","author_inst":"Public Health Gibraltar"},{"author_name":"Sohail Bhatti","author_inst":"Post-graduate Medical School, University of Gibraltar"},{"author_name":"Daniel Goyal","author_inst":"Gibraltar Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Yasin Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto.

The diameter in current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row-column group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ozkan Ufuk Nalbantoglu","author_inst":"Erciyes University"},{"author_name":"Sohail Bhatti","author_inst":"Post-graduate Medical School, University of Gibraltar"},{"author_name":"Daniel Goyal","author_inst":"Gibraltar Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Yasin Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto.

Detailed knowledge of the molecular biology of the infection is indispensable for understanding of the viral replication, host responses, and disease progression. We provide gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in three human cell lines (H1299, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells), using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. Small RNA profiling showed strong expression of the immunity and inflammation-associated microRNA miRNA-155 upon infection with both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 elicited approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the interferon response compared to SARS-CoV in the permissive human epithelial cell line Calu-3, and induction of cytokines such as CXCL10 or IL6. Single cell RNA sequencing data showed that canonical interferon stimulated genes such as IFIT2 or OAS2 were broadly induced, whereas interferon beta (IFNB1) and lambda (IFNL1-4) were expressed only in a subset of infected cells. In addition, temporal resolution of transcriptional responses suggested interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) activities precede that of nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B). Lastly, we identified heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as a protein relevant for the infection. Inhibition of the HSP90 charperone activity by Tanespimycin\/17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) resulted in a reduction of viral replication, and of TNF and IL1B mRNA levels. In summary, our study established in vitro cell culture models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified HSP90 protein as potential drug target for therapeutic intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emanuel Wyler","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Kirstin M\u00f6sbauer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Vedran Franke","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Asija Diag","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Lina Theresa Gottula","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Roberto Arsie","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Filippos Klironomos","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association; Department of Pediatrics, Charite - Unive"},{"author_name":"David Koppstein","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Salah Ayoub","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Christopher Buccitelli","author_inst":"Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Anja Richter","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Ivano Legnini","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Andranik Ivanov","author_inst":"Core Unit Bioinformatics, Berlin Institute of Health, Charite - University Hospital Berlin"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Mari","author_inst":"Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Simone Del Giudice","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Jan Patrick Papies","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Marcel Alexander M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Daniela Niemeyer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthias Selbach","author_inst":"Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Altuna Akalin","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Rajewsky","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Markus Landthaler","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association"},{"author_name":"Carol H.
