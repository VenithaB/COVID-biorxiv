With an extended SEIR model that allows infections in both the exposed and infected states, the key epidemic parameters are estimated from each country's data, which facilitate the evaluation and cross-country comparison. It is found quicker control measures significantly reduce the average reproduction numbers and shorten the time length to infection peaks. If the swift control measures of Korea and China were implemented, average reductions of 88% in the confirmed cases and 80% in deaths would had been attained for the other 23 countries from start to April 10. Effects of earlier or delayed interventions in the US and the UK are experimented which show at least 75% (29%) less infections and deaths can be attained for the US (the UK) under a Five-Day Earlier experiment. The impacts of two removal regimes (Korea and Italy) on the total infection and death tolls on the other countries are compared with the naturally forecast ones, which suggest there are still ample opportunity for countries to reduce the final death numbers by improving the removal process.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Gu","author_inst":"Center for Statistical Science, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Han Yan","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Ya Huang","author_inst":"Yuanpei College, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Data Science, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Hao Sun","author_inst":"Center for Data Science, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Guanghua School of Management, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yu Wang","author_inst":"Guanghua School of Management, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yumou Qiu","author_inst":"Iowa State Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Song Chen","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081414","rel_title":"Global academic response to COVID-19: Cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081414","rel_abs":"Objective: To describe the global academic response to COVID-19 during its early stages. The responsiveness of investigators, editorial teams, and publishers was explored. Design: Cross-sectional bibliometric review of COVID-19 literature. A parallel search of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) literature was performed for comparison of outcomes. Data sources: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The search for COVID-19 studies was performed between 1st November 2019 and 24th March 2020. The search for MERS studies was performed one year earlier between 1st November 2018 and 24th March 2019. Main outcome measures: Investigator-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the volume and type of published research. Editorial-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the time from manuscript submission to acceptance and the availability of original data to support the study results. Publisher-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the time from manuscript acceptance to first publication and the provision of open access. Results: In total, 398 of 2835 COVID-19 and 55 of 1513 MERS search results were eligible. Most COVID-19 studies were clinical reports (n=242; 60.8%) and the majority of these were case series (n=105; 43.4%) and single cases (n=65; 26.9%). The times from manuscript submission to acceptance (median: 5 days (IQR: 3-11) vs 71.5 days (38-106); P<0.001) and acceptance to publication (median: 5 days (IQR: 2-8) vs. 22.5 days (4-48.5-; P<0.001) were strikingly shorter for COVID-19. Almost all COVID-19 (n=396; 99.5%) and MERS (n=55; 100%) studies were available with open-access. Data sharing was infrequent, with original data available for 104 (26.1%) COVID-19 and 10 (18.2%) MERS studies (P=0.203). Conclusions: The early academic response to COVID-19 was characterised by investigators aiming to define the disease. These studies were made rapidly and openly available by editorial and publishing teams. Data sharing practises are an essential target for improvement as the pandemic progresses.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack A Helliwell","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"William S Bolton","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Joshua R Burke","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Jim P Tiernan","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David G Jayne","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Chapman","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Yu Wang","author_inst":"Guanghua School of Management, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yumou Qiu","author_inst":"Iowa State Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Song Chen","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081422","rel_title":"Is this beginning or the end of COVID-19 battle in India?

The epidemiological data of daily cases have been utilized from 25th March (i.e., the first day of lockdown) to 23rd April 2020. In the study, we have stimulated two possible scenarios (optimistic and pessimistic) for the prediction. As per the optimistic approach of modelling, COVID-19 may end in the first week of June 2020 with a total of 77,900 infected cases including 2,442 fatalities. However, the results under the pessimistic scenario are a bit scary as it shows that a total of 283,300 infected cases with 10,180 fatalities till 14th June. To win the battle, 10 weeks of complete lockdown is much needed at least in the infected states and the union territories of India.

As treatment protocols differ between the two types, and the number of ventilators is limited, it is vital to classify patients appropriately. To date, the only way to confirm phenotypes is through high-resolution computed tomography. Here, we identify L- and H-type patients from their frontal chest x-rays using feature-embedded machine learning. We then apply the categorization to multiple images from the same patient, extending it to detect and monitor disease progression and recovery.

Methods: Here we used data from proactive sampling carried out in New York City from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined weekly nasal swab collection with self-reports of respiratory symptoms from 191 participants to investigate the profile of recurring infections with endemic coronaviruses. Results: During the study, 12 individuals tested positive multiple times for the same coronavirus. We found no significant difference between the probability of testing positive at least once and the probability of a recurrence for the beta-coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 at 34 weeks after enrollment\/first infection. We also found no significant association between repeat infections and symptom severity but strong association between symptom severity and belonging to the same family. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that re-infections with the same endemic coronavirus are not atypical in a time window shorter than 1 year and that the genetic basis of innate immune response may be a greater determinant of infection severity than immune memory acquired after a previous infection.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marta Galanti","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Qian Ren","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Junjie Yang","author_inst":"Qilu Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yanqin Lu","author_inst":"Shandong Medicinal Biotechnology Centre, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"Shandong Institute of Industrial Technology for Health Sciences and Precision Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao Gai","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yumou Qiu","author_inst":"Iowa State Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Song Chen","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.074930","rel_title":"Design of an Epitope-Based Peptide Vaccine against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2): A Vaccine Informatics Approach","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.074930","rel_abs":"The recurrent and recent global outbreak of SARS-COV-2 has turned into a global concern which has infected more than one million people all over the globe, and this number is increasing in hours. Unfortunate no vaccine or specific treatment is available, which make it more deadly. An immunoinformatics approach has shown significant breakthrough in peptide-based epitope mapping and opens the new horizon in vaccine development. In this study, we have identified a total of 15 antigenic peptides (including T and B Cells) in the surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 which found to be 100% conserved with other SARS coronaviruses. Furthermore, the population coverage analysis has found that CD4+ T-cell peptides showed higher cumulative population coverage over to CD8+ peptides in the 16 different geographical regions in the world. Notably, only 09 out of 15 peptides (LTDEMIAQY, IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF, FGAGAALQ, VITPGTNTS, WTAGAAAYY and QTQTNSPRRARS) that have 80% - 90% identity with experimentally identified epitopes of different organisms including SARS-CoV and this will likely be beneficial for a quick progression of the vaccine design. Moreover, docking analysis suggested that these peptides are tightly bound in the groove of HLA molecules which can induce the T-cell response. Overall this study allows us to determine potent peptide antigen targets in surface glycoprotein on intuitive grounds which open up a new horizon in COVID-19 research. However, this study needs experimental validation by in vitro and in vivo.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arbaaz Khan","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi-110025"},{"author_name":"Aftab Alam","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, JMI University, New Delhi-110025."},{"author_name":"Nikhat Imam","author_inst":"Institute of Computer Science & Information Technology, Department of Mathematics, Magadh University, Bodh Gaya (Bihar, India)."},{"author_name":"Mohd Faizan Siddiqui","author_inst":"International Medical Faculty, Osh State University, Osh City, 723500, Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyzstan)"},{"author_name":"Romana Ishrat","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, JMI University, New Delhi-110025."},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"Shandong Institute of Industrial Technology for Health Sciences and Precision Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao Gai","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yumou Qiu","author_inst":"Iowa State Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Song Chen","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.074567","rel_title":"Large scale genomic analysis of 3067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes reveals a clonal geodistribution and a rich genetic variations of hotspots mutations","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.074567","rel_abs":"In late December 2019, an emerging viral infection COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China, and became a global pandemic. Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating it spread across countries.

Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variant sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 38 recurrent non-synonymous mutations, including ten hotspot mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed certain genotypes specific to the geographic location. We also found co-occurring mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Moreover, evolution over time has shown a mechanism of mutation co-accumulation which might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOn the other hand, analysis of the selective pressure revealed the presence of negatively selected residues that could be taken into considerations as therapeutic targets\n\nWe have also created an inclusive unified database (http:\/\/genoma.ma\/covid-19\/) that lists all of the genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes found in this study with phylogeographic analysis around the world.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meriem Laamarti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Tarek Alouane","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Souad Kartti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"M.W.

Currently, over three million people have been identified for SARS-CoV-2 infection but SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines and neutralizing antibodies are still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by interacting with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) via the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its surface spike glycoprotein. Therefore, blocking the interaction of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 by antibody would cause a directly neutralizing effect against virus. In the current study, we selected the ACE2 interface of SARS-CoV-2-RBD as the targeting epitope for neutralizing antibody screening. We performed site-directed screening by phage display and finally obtained one IgG antibody (4A3) and several domain antibodies. Among them, 4A3 and three domain antibodies (4A12, 4D5, and 4A10) were identified to act as neutralizing antibodies due to their capabilities to block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2-positive cells. The domain antibody 4A12 was predicted to have the best accessibility to all three ACE2-interfaces on the spike homotrimer. Pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays showed that all four antibodies could potently protect host cells from virus infection. Overall, we isolated multiple formats of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies via site-directed antibody screening, which could be promising candidate drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Liu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Antibody Techniques, School of Basic Medical Scien"},{"author_name":"Fang Gao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Antibody Techniques, School of Basic Medical Scien"},{"author_name":"Liming Gou","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Antibody Techniques, School of Basic Medical Scien"},{"author_name":"Yin Chen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Ministry of Health Institute of Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Province Center for Disease Control and Prev"},{"author_name":"Yayun Gu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, International Joint Research Center on Environment and Human Health, School of Public Health, State Key Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lei Ao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Antibody Techniques, School of Basic Medical Scien"},{"author_name":"Hongbing Shen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, International Joint Research Center on Environment and Human Health, Center for Global Health, School of Public He"},{"author_name":"Zhibin Hu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, International Joint Research Center on Environment and Human Health, School of Public Health, State Key Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Xiling Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Ministry of Health Institute of Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Province Center for Disease Control and Prev"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Antibody Techniques, School of Basic Medical Scien"},{"author_name":"Rachid El Jaoudi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Imane Allali","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, and Genomic Center of Human Pathologies, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, "},{"author_name":"Nabila Marchoudi","author_inst":"Anoual Laboratory of Radio-Immuno Analysis, Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Jamal Fekkak","author_inst":"Anoual Laboratory of Radio-Immuno Analysis, Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Houda Benrahma Sr.","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Chakib Nejjari","author_inst":"International School of Public Health, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Saaid Amzazi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, and Genomic Center of Human Pathologies, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, "},{"author_name":"Lahcen Belyamani","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Military Hospital Mohammed V, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Azeddine Ibrahimi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081505","rel_title":"Simulating a community mental health service during the COVID-19 pandemic: effects of clinician-clinician encounters, clinician-patient-family encounters, symptom-triggered protective behaviour, and household clustering","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081505","rel_abs":"Background. Face-to-face healthcare, including psychiatric provision, must continue despite reduced interpersonal contact during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) pandemic. Community-based services might use domiciliary visits, consultations in healthcare settings, or remote consultations. Services might also alter direct contact between clinicians. Aims. We examined the effects of appointment types and clinician-clinician encounters upon infection rates. Methods. We modelled a COVID-19-like disease in a hypothetical community healthcare team, their patients, and patients' household contacts (family). In one condition, clinicians met patients and briefly met family (e.g. home visit or collateral history). In another, patients attended alone (e.g. clinic visit), segregated from each other. In another, face-to-face contact was eliminated (e.g. videoconferencing). We also varied clinician-clinician contact; baseline and ongoing \"external\" infection rates; whether overt symptoms reduced transmission risk behaviourally (e.g. via personal protective equipment, PPE); and household clustering. Results. Service organization had minimal effects on whole-population infection under our assumptions but materially affected clinician infection. Appointment type and inter-clinician contact had greater effects at low external infection rates and without a behavioural symptom response. Clustering magnified the effect of appointment type. We discuss infection control and other factors affecting appointment choice and team organization. Conclusions. Distancing between clinicians can have significant effects on team infection. Loss of clinicians to infection likely has an adverse impact on care, not modelled here. Appointments must account for clinical necessity as well as infection control. Interventions to reduce transmission risk can synergize, arguing for maximal distancing and behavioural measures (e.g. PPE) consistent with safe care.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rudolf Nicholas Cardinal","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Meiser-Stedman","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"David M Christmas","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Annabel C Price","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Chess Denman","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R Underwood","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Chen Shanquan","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Soumya Nicholas Banerjee","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Simon R White","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Li Su","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Tamsin J.

However, there is limited understanding of its impact on the mental health of the general population. The aim of this study was to examine the mental health of the Japanese general population by conducting the first systematic survey during the pandemic with a particular focus on identifying the most vulnerable groups. Methods: Data was obtained from an online commercial web panel of 2000 respondents in April and May 2020. Information was collected on demographic and socioeconomic factors as well as mental health status (anxiety and depressive symptoms). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations. Results: The mental health of young and middle-aged individuals was significantly worse than that of older individuals during the pandemic. There was also some indication that individuals who were not currently working were significantly more likely to report a high level of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Part-time and temporary contract-based workers were also more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Our results highlight that monitoring the mental health of younger and economically vulnerable individuals may be especially important. In addition, they also indicate that population mental health might not only be affected by the direct health consequences of COVID-19, but also by the economic ramifications of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michiko Ueda","author_inst":"Waseda University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Stickley","author_inst":"Waseda University; National Institute of Mental Health, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry"},{"author_name":"Hajime Sueki","author_inst":"Wako University"},{"author_name":"Tetsuya Matsubayashi","author_inst":"Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Chess Denman","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R Underwood","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Chen Shanquan","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Soumya Nicholas Banerjee","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Simon R White","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Li Su","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Tamsin J.

We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread. The model utilizes COVID19-specific parameters and data from Georgia on population interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a seven and a half-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The following outcomes are compared at the state and community levels: the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. The results suggest that shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from approximately 180K under no intervention and 113K under school closure, respectively, to below 53K, and delayed the peak from April to July or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 2-9% and 3-11% decrease in cumulative infection and deaths, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 53K to 25K, and decreased cumulative infections by about 50%. The cumulative number of deaths ranged from 6,660 to 19,430 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 6 days. Overall, shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine substantially reduced COVID19 infections, healthcare resource needs, and severe outcomes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Buse Eylul Oruc Aglar","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Arden Baxter","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"John Asplund","author_inst":"Department of Technology and Mathematics, Dalton State College, Dalton, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicoleta Serban","author_inst":"Georgia Institue of Technology"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R Underwood","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Chen Shanquan","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Soumya Nicholas Banerjee","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Simon R White","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Li Su","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Tamsin J.

The aim of this study was to derive and validate risk prediction models for poor outcome and death in adult inpatients with COVID-19. Methods Model derivation using data from Wuhan, China used logistic regression with death and poor outcome (death or severe disease) as outcomes. Predictors were demographic, comorbidity, symptom and laboratory test variables. The best performing models were externally validated in data from London, UK. Findings 4.3% of the derivation cohort (n=775) died and 9.7% had a poor outcome, compared to 34.1% and 42.9% of the validation cohort (n=226). In derivation, prediction models based on age, sex, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, C-reactive protein and creatinine had excellent discrimination (death c-index=0.91, poor outcome c-index=0.88), with good-to-excellent calibration. Using two cut-offs to define low, high and very-high risk groups, derivation patients were stratified in groups with observed death rates of 0.34%, 15.0% and 28.3% and poor outcome rates 0.63%, 8.9% and 58.5%. External validation discrimination was good (c-index death=0.74, poor outcome=0.72) as was calibration. However, observed rates of death were 16.5%, 42.9% and 58.4% and poor outcome 26.3%, 28.4% and 64.8% in predicted low, high and very-high risk groups. Interpretation Our prediction model using demography and routinely-available laboratory tests performed very well in internal validation in the lower-risk derivation population, but less well in the much higher-risk external validation population. Further external validation is needed. Collaboration to create larger derivation datasets, and to rapidly externally validate all proposed prediction models in a range of populations is needed, before routine implementation of any risk prediction tool in clinical care.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huayu Zhang","author_inst":"Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peoples Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Kun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London, London, England, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London, London, England, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Department of Stroke and Neurology, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, England, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pei Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Chenghong Li","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Sixth Hospital, Jianghan University, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Kevin Dhaliwal","author_inst":"Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Qiang Li","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Centre for Population Health Sciences, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Chakib Nejjari","author_inst":"International School of Public Health, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Saaid Amzazi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, and Genomic Center of Human Pathologies, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, "},{"author_name":"Lahcen Belyamani","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Military Hospital Mohammed V, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Azeddine Ibrahimi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083246","rel_title":"Systematic investigations of COVID-19 in 283 cancer patients","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083246","rel_abs":"Background: Cancer patients are considered to be highly susceptible to viral infections, however, the comprehensive features of COVID-19 in these patients remained largely unknown. The present study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in a large cohort of cancer patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data of consecutive cancer patients admitted to 33 designated hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China from December 17, 2019 to March 18, 2020 were retrospectively collected. The follow-up cutoff date was April 02, 2020. The clinical course and survival status of the cancer patients with COVID-19 were measured, and the potential risk factors of severe events and death were assessed through univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: A total of 283 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients (50% male; median age, 63.0 years [IQR, 55.0 to 70.0]) with more than 20 cancer types were included. The overall mortality rate was 18% (50\/283), and the median hospitalization stay for the survivors was 26 days. Amongst all, 76 (27%) were former cancer patients with curative resections for over five years without recurrence. The current cancer patients exhibited worse outcomes versus former cancer patients (overall survival, HR=2.45, 95%CI 1.10 to 5.44, log-rank p=0.02; mortality rate, 21% vs 9%). Of the 207 current cancer patients, 95 (46%) have received recent anti-tumor treatment, and the highest mortality rate was observed in the patients receiving recent chemotherapy (33%), followed by surgery (26%), other anti-tumor treatments (19%), and no anti-tumor treatment (15%). In addition, a higher mortality rate was observed in patients with lymphohematopoietic malignancies (LHM) (53%, 9\/17), and all seven LHM patients with recent chemotherapy died. Multivariable analysis indicated that LHM (p=0.001) was one of the independent factors associating with critical illness or death. Conclusions: This is the first systematic study comprehensively depicting COVID-19 in a large cancer cohort. Patients with tumors, especially LHM, may have poorer prognosis of COVID-19. Additional cares are warranted and non-emergency anti-tumor treatment should be cautiously used for these patients under the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":45,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie

threat to global health security. There are a very few prognostic models on CoVID-19 using machine learning. Objectives: To predict mortality among confirmed CoVID-19 patients in South Korea using machine learning and deploy the best performing algorithm as an open-source online prediction tool for decision-making. Materials and methods: Mortality for confirmed CoVID-19 patients (n=3,299) between January 20, 2020 and April 30, 2020 was predicted using five machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, K nearest neighbor, random forest and gradient boosting). Performance of the algorithms was compared, and the best performing algorithm was deployed as an online prediction tool. Results: The random forest algorithm was the best performer in terms of predictive ability (accuracy=0.981), discrimination (area under ROC curve=0.886), calibration (Matthews Correlation Coefficient=0.459; Brier Score=0.063) and. The best performer algorithm (random forest) was deployed as the online CoVID-19 Community Mortality Risk Prediction tool named CoCoMoRP (https:\/\/ashis-das.shinyapps.io\/CoCoMoRP\/). Conclusions: We describe the development and deployment of an open-source machine learning tool to predict mortality risk among CoVID-19 confirmed patients using publicly available surveillance data.

pandemic that is spreading quickly across the world. Italy, that is widely considered one of the main epicenters of the pandemic, has registered the highest COVID-2019 death rates and death toll in the world, to the present day. In this article I estimate an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast the epidemic trend over the period after April 4, 2020, by using the Italian epidemiological data at national and regional level. The data refer to the number of daily confirmed cases officially registered by the Italian Ministry of Health (www.salute.gov.it) for the period February 20 to April 4, 2020. The main advantage of this model is that it is easy to manage and fit. Moreover, it may give a first understanding of the basic trends, by suggesting the hypothetic epidemic's inflection point and final size.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaetano

Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection (mostly RT-PCR and Computed Tomography) are not widely available in numerous countries, expensive and with imperfect performance Methods: This multicenter retrospective study aimed to determine a pre-test probability score for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on clinical and biological variables. Patients were recruited from emergency and infectious disease departments and were divided into a training and a validation cohort. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and results of blood tests (complete white blood cell count, serum electrolytes and CRP) were collected. The pre-test probability score was derived from univariate analyses between patients and controls, followed by multivariate binary logistic analysis to determine the independent variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Points were assigned to each variable to create the PARIS score. ROC curve analysis determined the area under the curve (AUC) Findings: One hundred subjects with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the training cohort, and 300 other consecutive individuals were included in the validation cohort. Low lymphocyte (<1.3 G\/L), eosinophil (<0.06G\/L), basophil (<0.04G\/L) and neutrophil counts (<5G\/L) were associated with a high probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No clinical variable was statistically significant. The score had a good performance in the validation cohort (AUC=0.889 (CI: [0.846-0.932]; STD=0.022) with a sensitivity and Positive Predictive Value of high-probability score of 80.3% and 92.3% respectively. Furthermore, a low-probability score excluded SARS-CoV-2 infection with a Negative Predictive Value of 99.5% Interpretation: The PARIS score based on complete white blood cell count has a good performance to categorize the pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It could help clinicians avoid diagnostic tests in patients with a low-probability score and conversely keep on testing individuals with high-probability score but negative RT-PCR or CT. It could prove helpful in countries with a low-availability of PCR and\/or CT during the current period of pandemic","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mickael

Highly variable in its presentation, spread and clinical outcome, novel point-of-care diagnostic classifiers are urgently required. Here, we describe a set of COVID-19 clinical classifiers discovered using a newly designed low-cost high-throughput mass spectrometry-based platform. Introducing a new sample preparation pipeline coupled with short-gradient high-flow liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, our methodology facilitates clinical implementation and increases sample throughput and quantification precision. Providing a rapid assessment of serum or plasma samples at scale, we report 27 biomarkers that distinguish mild and severe forms of COVID-19, of which some may have potential as therapeutic targets. These proteins highlight the role of complement factors, the coagulation system, inflammation modulators as well as pro-inflammatory signalling upstream and downstream of Interleukin 6. Application of novel methodologies hence transforms proteomics from a research tool into a rapid-response, clinically actionable technology adaptable to infectious outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christoph B.

Methods: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study comparing the proportion of anos-mia using Sniffin-sticks in those reporting a loss of smell, in those who did not as well as in unin-fected controls. The outcome of anosmic versus not anosmic patients were recorded during hospital stay and at day 15 on a six-category ordinal scale. The study was approved by the insti-tutional review board, all participants consented to the study. Results: 40% of 45 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 0% of 45 uninfected con-trols consenting were diagnosed with anosmia. 44% of anosmic and 50% of hyposmic patients did not report having smelling problems. Anosmia or hyposmia was not predictive of a severe COVID-19 manifestation. Conclusions: The majority of COVID-19 patients have an objective anosmia and hyposmia, which often occurs unnoticed. These symptoms may be related to the neuroinvasive propensity of SARS-COV-2 and the unusual presentation of COVID-19 disease manifestations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Hornuss","author_inst":"Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Nils Schroeter","author_inst":"Department of Neurology and Neurophysiology, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Siegbert Rieg","author_inst":"Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Winfried V.

At the current time a number of qRT-PCR assays have been developed to identify SARS-CoV-2, targeting multiple positions in the viral genome. While the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is moderate, given the large number of transmission chains it is prudent to monitor circulating viruses for variants that might compromise these assays. Here we report the identification of a C-to-T transition at position 26,340 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome which is associated with failure of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 E-gene qRT-PCR in eight patients. As the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay targets two positions in the genome, the individuals carrying this variant were still called as SARS-CoV-2 positive. Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed all to carry closely related viruses. Examination of viral genomes deposited on GISAID showed this mutation has arisen independently at least four times. This work highlights the necessity of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 for the emergence of SNPs which might adversely affect RT-PCRs used in diagnostics. Additionally, it argues that two regions in SARS-CoV-2 should be targeted to avoid false negatives.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Artesi","author_inst":"University of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Bontems","author_inst":"University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Paul Gobbels","author_inst":"St-Nikolaus Hospital, Eupen"},{"author_name":"Marc Franckh","author_inst":"St-Nikolaus Hospital"},{"author_name":"Piet Maes","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Raphael Boreux","author_inst":"University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Cecile Meex","author_inst":"University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Pierrette Melin","author_inst":"University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Marie-Pierre Hayette","author_inst":"University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Vincent Bours","author_inst":"University of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Keith Durkin","author_inst":"University of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Christiane Kilian","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Department of Biochemistry, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Federica Agostini","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Department of Biochemistry, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aleksej Zelezniak","author_inst":"Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg SE-412 96, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thibeault","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Dept. of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Moritz Pfeiffer","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Dept. of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hippenstiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Dept. of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Hocke","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Dept. of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christof von Kalle","author_inst":"Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), and  Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Clinical Study Center (CSC), 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Archie Campbell","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh United Kingdom and Usher Institute, Universi"},{"author_name":"Caroline Hayward","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"David J.

More notably, critically ill patients displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation as previously described in autoimmune settings. Extrafollicular activation correlated strongly with large antibody secreting cell expansion and early production of high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Yet, these patients fared poorly with elevated inflammatory biomarkers, multi-organ failure, and death. Combined, the findings strongly indicate a major pathogenic role for immune activation in subsets of COVID-19 patients.

Therefore, we sought to characterize the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a live registry of heart failure patients across an integrated health care system in Connecticut. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701) that includes 26,703 patients with heart failure across a 6-hospital integrated health care system in Connecticut, was queried on April 16th, 2020 for all patients tested for COVID-19. Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry. Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review. Results: COVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N=26,703). Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID-19+. As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P<0.05, all). COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19+ were largely clustered around urban centers. 20% of COVID-19+ patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33-2.78); P<0.001]. Among COVID-19+ patients who were [&ge;]85 years of age rates of hospitalization were 87%, rates of death 36%, and continuing hospitalization 62% at time of manuscript preparation. Conclusions: In this real-world snapshot of COVID-19 infection among a large cohort of heart failure patients, we found that a small proportion had undergone testing. Patients found to be COVID-19+ tended to be black with multiple comorbidities and clustered around lower socioeconomic status communities. Elderly COVID-19+ patients were very likely to be admitted to the hospital and experience high rates of mortality.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cesar Caraballo","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Megan McCullough","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Fuery","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fouad Chouairi","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Keating","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Neal Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elliott Miller","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Maricar Malinis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nitu Kashyap","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Allen Hsiao","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francis Perry Wilson","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeptha Curtis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Grant","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eric J Velazquez","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nihar Desai","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tariq Ahmad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monika Sharma","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Henry Wu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sang Le","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Scott Jenks","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Tipton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Wiliam Hu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"F.

The results show that atmospheric particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 is a highly significant predictor of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and related hospital admissions. The estimates suggest that expected COVID-19 cases increase by nearly 100 percent when pollution concentrations increase by 20 percent. The association between air pollution and case incidence is robust in the presence of data on health-related preconditions, proxies for symptom severity, and demographic control variables. The results are obtained with ground-measurements and satellite-derived measures of atmospheric particulate matter as well as COVID-19 data from alternative dates. The findings call for further investigation into the association between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. If particulate matter plays a significant role in COVID-19 incidence, it has strong implications for the mitigation strategies required to prevent spreading.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Pieter Johannes Andree","author_inst":"World Bank"},{"author_name":"Megan McCullough","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Fuery","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fouad Chouairi","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Keating","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Neal Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elliott Miller","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Maricar Malinis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nitu Kashyap","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Allen Hsiao","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francis Perry Wilson","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeptha Curtis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Grant","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eric J Velazquez","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nihar Desai","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tariq Ahmad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monika Sharma","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Henry Wu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sang Le","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Scott Jenks","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Tipton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Wiliam Hu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"F.

We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods. Methods We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing, and shielding (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio. Results We predicted median clinical attack rates over the first 12 months of 17% (Niger) to 39% (Mauritius), peaking at 2-4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R 0 . The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Response strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand by 46% to 54% and mortality by 60% to 75%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature. Discussion In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding will probably achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francesco Checchi","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeptha Curtis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Grant","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eric J Velazquez","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nihar Desai","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tariq Ahmad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monika Sharma","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Henry Wu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sang Le","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Scott Jenks","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Tipton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Wiliam Hu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"F.

To that end, we propose a novel mechanism to answer clinical queries: Rapid Meta-Analysis (RMA). Unlike traditional meta-analysis, RMA balances quick time-to-production with reasonable data quality assurances, leveraging Artificial Intelligence to strike this balance. This article presents an example RMA to a currently relevant clinical question: Is ocular toxicity and vision compromise a side effect with hydroxychloroquine therapy? As of this writing, hydroxychloroquine is a leading candidate in the treatment of COVID-19. By combining AI with human analysis, our RMA identified 11 studies looking at ocular toxicity as a side effect and estimated the incidence to be 3.4% (95% CI: 1.11-9.96%). The heterogeneity across the individual study findings was high, and interpretation of the result should take this into account. Importantly, this RMA, from search to screen to analysis, took less than 30 minutes to produce.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Michelson","author_inst":"Evid Science, InferLink"},{"author_name":"Steven Minton","author_inst":"InferLink"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Chow","author_inst":"Evid Science"},{"author_name":"Neil Martin","author_inst":"Pacific Neuroscience Institute, Providence St John's Health Center"},{"author_name":"Mike Ross","author_inst":"Evid Science"},{"author_name":"Amelia Tee","author_inst":"Evid Science"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francesco Checchi","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeptha Curtis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Grant","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eric J Velazquez","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nihar Desai","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tariq Ahmad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monika Sharma","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Henry Wu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sang Le","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Scott Jenks","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Tipton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Wiliam Hu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"F.

As part of initial response activities in the United States, enhanced contact investigations were conducted to enable early identification and isolation of additional cases and to learn more about risk factors for transmission. Methods Close contacts of nine early travel-related cases in the United States were identified. Close contacts meeting criteria for active monitoring were followed, and selected individuals were targeted for collection of additional exposure details and respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results There were 404 close contacts who underwent active monitoring in the response jurisdictions; 338 had at least basic exposure data, of whom 159 had at least 1 set of respiratory samples collected and tested. Across all known close contacts under monitoring, two additional cases were identified; both secondary cases were in spouses of travel-associated case patients. The secondary attack rate among household members, all of whom had at least 1 respiratory sample tested, was 13% (95% CI: 4 - 38%). Conclusions The enhanced contact tracing investigations undertaken around nine early travel-related cases of COVID-19 in the United States identified two cases of secondary transmission, both spouses. Rapid detection and isolation of the travel-associated case patients, enabled by public awareness of COVID-19 among travelers from China, may have mitigated transmission risk among close contacts of these cases.","rel_num_authors":100,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel M Burke","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Sharon Balter","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Emily Barnes","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vaughn Barry","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Karri Bartlett","author_inst":"Public Health Madison & Dane County, WI"},{"author_name":"Karlyn D Beer","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Isaac Benowitz","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Holly M Biggs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hollianne Bruce","author_inst":"Snohomish Health District, Everett, WA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Bryant-Genevier","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jordan Cates","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kevin Chatham-Stephens","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nora Chea","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Howard Chiou","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Los Angeles County Public Health Department, CA"},{"author_name":"Demian Christiansen","author_inst":"Cook County Department of Public Health, IL"},{"author_name":"Victoria Chu","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shauna Clark","author_inst":"Public Health Seattle-King County, WA"},{"author_name":"Sara H.

across the USA since early March, but at a decreasing rate, where the rate r is defined as the exponential increase. I modeled the way the rate of increase y = log(exp(r)-1) has declined through time in each of the 51 states with the goal of determining whether state-at-home orders correlate with reductions in the rate of spread of the virus. A piecewise linear regression was used, with a single break point. This model can identify whether there was a change in the rate of decline, when the change happened, and which states have shown the greatest improvement in reducing the spread of COVID-19. The piecewise model identified a significant breakpoint on 24 Mar for all states combined, and all states had nearly the same breakpoint. Prior to 24 Mar, the average change in y was -0.013 per day, meaning a reduction in the rate of spread from 23.5 pct. per day to 19.5 pct. per day; after 24 Mar, the average change in y was -0.070 per day, a reduction from 19.5 pct. per day to 7.5 pct. per day. Prior to 24 Mar there was no significant variation among states in the decline in y, but after 24 Mar there was substantial variation, and the date on which states issued stay at home orders correlated with that variation. Montana, Idaho, and Vermont showed the greatest improvement, while Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa the least. The improvement as measured by the reduction after 24 Mar did not correlate with case density in a state, nor state population.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Condit","author_inst":"Retired"},{"author_name":"Venkatnarayan Ramanathan","author_inst":"IIT(BHU) Varanasi"},{"author_name":"Emily Barnes","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vaughn Barry","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Karri Bartlett","author_inst":"Public Health Madison & Dane County, WI"},{"author_name":"Karlyn D Beer","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Isaac Benowitz","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Holly M Biggs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hollianne Bruce","author_inst":"Snohomish Health District, Everett, WA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Bryant-Genevier","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jordan Cates","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kevin Chatham-Stephens","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nora Chea","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Howard Chiou","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Los Angeles County Public Health Department, CA"},{"author_name":"Demian Christiansen","author_inst":"Cook County Department of Public Health, IL"},{"author_name":"Victoria Chu","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shauna Clark","author_inst":"Public Health Seattle-King County, WA"},{"author_name":"Sara H.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been spreading through all the world fastly. In this work we focus on the evolution of the COVID-19 in one of the most populous Brazilian states, namely the Rio de Janeiro state. The first case was reported in March 5, 2020, thus we have a considerable amount of available data to make a good analysis. First we study the early evolution of the disease, considering a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model. This initial phase shows the usual exponential growth of the number of confirmed cases. In this case, we estimate the parameters of the model based on the data, as well as the epidemic doubling time. After, we analyze all the available data, from March 5, 2020 through April 26, 2020. In this case, we observe a distinct behavior: a sub-exponential growth. In order to capture this change in the behavior of the evolution of the confirmed cases, we consider the implementation of isolation policies. The modified model agrees well with data. Finally, we consider the relaxation of such policies, and discuss about the ideal period of time to release people to return to their activities.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nuno Crokidakis","author_inst":"Universidade Federal Fluminense"},{"author_name":"Venkatnarayan Ramanathan","author_inst":"IIT(BHU) Varanasi"},{"author_name":"Emily Barnes","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vaughn Barry","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Karri Bartlett","author_inst":"Public Health Madison & Dane County, WI"},{"author_name":"Karlyn D Beer","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Isaac Benowitz","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Holly M Biggs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hollianne Bruce","author_inst":"Snohomish Health District, Everett, WA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Bryant-Genevier","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jordan Cates","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kevin Chatham-Stephens","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nora Chea","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Howard Chiou","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Los Angeles County Public Health Department, CA"},{"author_name":"Demian Christiansen","author_inst":"Cook County Department of Public Health, IL"},{"author_name":"Victoria Chu","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shauna Clark","author_inst":"Public Health Seattle-King County, WA"},{"author_name":"Sara H.
