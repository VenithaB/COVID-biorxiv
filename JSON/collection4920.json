It presents with a highly variable disease course ranging from a large proportion of asymptomatic cases to severe respiratory failure in 17-29% of cases even in the absence of apparent comorbidities 1, 2. This implies a diverse host immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The immunological characteristics underlying these divergent disease courses, however, still remain elusive. While insights into abrogations of innate immunity begin to emerge, adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 are poorly investigated, although they serve as immune signatures of protection and vaccine responses. We therefore set out to characterize immune signatures of convalescent COVID-19 patients stratified according to their disease severity. Methods: We performed high-dimensional flow cytometric profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of convalescent COVID-19 patients who we stratified according to their disease severity by a physician-assisted questionnaire based assessment of COVID-19 symptoms. Results: Surprisingly, we did not observe any difference in the relative proportions of any major immune cell type in convalescent patients presenting with different severity of COVID-19 disease except for a reduction in monocytes. The frequency of Tnaive T cells was significantly reduced in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whereas other T cell differentiations states (TCM, TEM, TEMRA) remained relatively unaffected by COVID-19 severity as assessed approximately two weeks after infection. Conclusions In our COVID-19 patient cohort, which is characterized by absence of comorbidities and therapeutic interventions other than symptomatic antipyretics, the immunophenotype is similar irrespective of a highly variable disease severity. Convalescence is therefore associated with a rather uniform immune signature. Abrogations, which were previously identified in the innate and adaptive immune compartment of COVID-19 patients should be scrutinized for direct associations with a preconditioned immune system shaped and made vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 by preexisting comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chang-Feng Chu","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Florian Sabath","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Shan Sun","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Ying-Yin Chao","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Christina E.

At the current stage of COVID-19 pandemic, forecasts become particularly important regarding the possibility that the total incidence could reach the level where the disease stops spreading because a considerable portion of the population has become immune and collective immunity could be reached. Such forecasts are valuable because the currently undertaken restrictive measures prevent mass morbidity but do not result in the development of a robust collective immunity. Thus, in the absence of efficient vaccines and medical treatments, lifting restrictive measures carries the risk that a second wave of the epidemic could occur. Methods. We developed a heterogeneous model of COVID-19 dynamics. The model accounted for the differences in the infection risk across subpopulations, particularly the age-depended susceptibility to the disease. Based on this model, an equation for the minimal number of infections was calculated as a condition for the epidemic to start declining. The basic reproductive number of 2.5 was used for the disease spread without restrictions. The model was applied to COVID-19 data from Italy. Findings. We found that the heterogeneous model of epidemic dynamics yielded a lower proportion, compared to a homogeneous model, for the minimal incidence needed for the epidemic to stop. When applied to the data for Italy, the model yielded a more optimistic assessment of the minimum total incidence needed to reach collective immunity: 43% versus 60% estimated with a homogeneous model. Interpretation. Because of the high heterogeneity of COVID-19 infection risk across the different age groups, with a higher susceptibility for the elderly, homogeneous models overestimate the level of collective immunity needed for the disease to stop spreading. This inaccuracy can be corrected by the homogeneous model introduced here. To improve the estimate even further additional factors should be considered that contribute to heterogeneity, including social and professional activity, gender and individual resistance to the pathogen.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrey Gerasimov","author_inst":"I.M.

Nearly five million individuals have since been diagnosed with this increasingly common and potentially lethal viral infection. Emerging evidence suggests a disproportionate burden of illness and death among minority communities. We aimed to evaluate the effect of ethnicity on outcomes among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Northern Nevada. Design: Single-center, retrospective observational study Materials and methods: The electronic health records of 172 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were obtained from a 946-bed tertiary referral center serving Northern Nevada. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared by ethnic group (Hispanic versus non-Hispanic). Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of mortality. Results: Among 172 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 12th and May 8th, 2020, 87 (50.6%) identified as Hispanic and 81 (47.1%) as non-Hispanic. The mean age was 46.0 among Hispanics and 55.8 among non-Hispanics. Comorbidities linked to increased COVID-19-related mortality - hypertension, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - were more common among the non-Hispanic population. Hispanic individuals were significantly more likely to be uninsured and to live in low-income communities as compared to their non-Hispanic counterparts (27.6% versus 8.2% and 52.9% versus 30.6%, respectively). Hispanic patients were also less likely than non-Hispanics to have a primary care provider (42.5% versus 61.2%). However, mortality was significantly higher among the non-Hispanic population (15.3% versus 5.8%). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected Hispanic individuals in Northern Nevada, who account for only 25.7% of the population but over half of the confirmed cases. Hispanic individuals were younger and had fewer comorbidities than their non-Hispanic counterparts; consequently, despite considerable socioeconomic disadvantage, mortality was lower among the Hispanic population. The underlying causes of ethnic disparities in COVID-19 incidence remain to be established, but further investigation may lead to more effective community- and systems-based interventions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Antwi-Amoabeng","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bryce David Beutler","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Munadel Awad","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zahara Kanji","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sumaiya Mahboob","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Ghuman","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sri Harsha Boppana","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Salman Sheikh","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark B.

The overall summaries at coarser spatial scales that are obtained by simply averaging individual curves (across regions) obscure nuanced variability and blurs the spatial heterogeneity at finer spatial scales. We employ statistical methods to analyze shapes of local COVID-19 growth rate curves and statistically group them into distinct clusters, according to their shapes. Using this information, we derive the so-called elastic averages of curves within these clusters, which correspond to the dominant incidence patterns. We apply this methodology to the analysis of the daily incidence trajectory of the COVID-pandemic at two spatial scales: A state-level analysis within the USA and a country-level analysis within Europe during mid-February to mid-May, 2020. Our analyses reveal a few dominant incidence trajectories that characterize transmission dynamics across states in the USA and across countries in Europe. This approach results in broad classifications of spatial areas into different trajectories and adds to the methodological toolkit for guiding public health decision making at different spatial scales.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anuj Srivastava","author_inst":"Florida State University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Peter Howley","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Stojanovski","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Sumaiya Mahboob","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Ghuman","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sri Harsha Boppana","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Salman Sheikh","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark B.

These observations are in stark contrast with a known pattern, correlating the death rate with the reduced medical staff in hospitals on the weekends. One possible hypothesis addressing these observations is that they reflect a gradually increasing stress with the progressing week, which can trigger the maximal death rates observed on Thursdays\/Fridays. Moreover, assuming the weekends provide the likely time for new infections, the maximum number of new cases might fall again on Thursdays\/Fridays. These observations deserve further study to provide better understanding of the COVID-19 dynamics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tomas Pavlicek","author_inst":"University of Haifa"},{"author_name":"Pavel Rehak","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Petr Kral","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Stojanovski","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Sumaiya Mahboob","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Ghuman","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sri Harsha Boppana","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Salman Sheikh","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark B.

METHODS: All COVID-19 infected patients reported in Xi'an up to 10 February 2020 were included for this analysis. Among these cases, clinical and chest CT data of 62 cases were obtained from three hospital in Xi'an. With this information, patients were grouped on basis of exposure history and transmission chains as first-generation, second-generation and third-generation patients. We described clinical characteristics and evaluated CT score\/patterns in these COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: There was a clear age differences in multiple generations with COVID-19 infection. Above two thirds of the second-generation (75.0%) and third-generation patients (77.8%) were aged [&ge;]45 years while 40.0% of first-generation cases at this age (p=0.001). More than half of second-generation patients (52.8%) and third-generation patients (55.6%) have comorbidities and is predominantly hypertensive (22.8% of second-generation vs. 27.8% of third-generation infections). The main exposure of second- and third-generation patients in Xi'an is family exposure (35.2%). For evaluation of CT findings of pulmonary involvement, the total CT score were 4.22{+\/-}3.00 in first-generation group, 4.35{+\/-}3.03 in second-generation group and 7.62{+\/-}3.56 in third-generation group (p<0.001).

Objective: To evaluate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19, and to further explore potential sex-specific differences. Methods: We analyzed the data from 18,465 laboratory-confirmed cases that completed an epidemiological investigation in Hubei Province as of February 27, 2020. Information on death was obtained from the Infectious Disease Information System. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19. Results: The median age for COVID-19 patients was 50.5 years. 8828(47.81%) patients were females. Severe cases accounted for 20.11% of the study population. As of March 7, 2020, a total of 919 cases deceased from COVID-19 for a fatality rate of 4.98%. Hypertension (13.87%), diabetes (5.53%), and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases CBVDs (4.45%) were the most prevalent comorbidities, and 27.37% of patients with COVID-19 reported having at least one comorbidity. After adjustment for age, gender, address, and clinical severity, patients with hypertension (HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.35-1.78), diabetes (HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.13-1.62), CBVDs (HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.43-2.02), chronic kidney diseases (HR 2.09, 95%CI 1.47-2.98), and at least two comorbidities (HR 1.84, 95%CI 1.55-2.18) had significant increased risks of death. And the association between diabetes and the risk of death from COVID-19 was prominent in women (HR 1.69, 95%CI 1.27-2.25) than in men (HR 1.16, 95%CI 0.91-1.46) (P for interaction = 0.036). Conclusion: Among laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hubei province, China, patients with hypertension, diabetes, CBVDs, chronic kidney diseases were significantly associated with increased risk of death. The association between diabetes and the risk of death tended to be stronger in women than in men. Clinicians should increase their awareness of the increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients with comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mingyang Wu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"shuqiong Huang","author_inst":"Institute of Preventive Medicine Information, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jun Liu","author_inst":"Central office, Qianjiang City Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yanling Shu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology"},{"author_name":"Yinbo Luo","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Disease Control and Prevention, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lulin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Maternal and Child Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mingyan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Preventive Medicine Information, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Youjie Wang","author_inst":"Department of Maternal and Child Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Xi'an Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lingxia Zeng","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Jian Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"George J Hruza","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, St. Louis University"},{"author_name":"Lindy P Fox","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20109850","rel_title":"COVID-19 Outcomes in 4712 consecutively confirmed SARS-CoV2 cases in the city of Madrid.","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20109850","rel_abs":"There is limited information describing features and outcomes of patients requiring hospitalization for COVID19 disease and still no treatments have clearly demonstrated efficacy. Demographics and clinical variables on admission, as well as laboratory markers and therapeutic interventions were extracted from electronic Clinical Records (eCR) in 4712 SARS-CoV2 infected patients attending 4 public Hospitals in Madrid. Patients were stratified according to age and stage of severity. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, cut-off points that best discriminated mortality were obtained for each of the studied variables. Principal components analysis and a neural network (NN) algorithm were applied. A high mortality incidence associated to age >70, comorbidities (hypertension, neurological disorders and diabetes), altered vitals such as fever, heart rhythm disturbances or elevated systolic blood pressure, and alterations in several laboratory tests. Remarkably, analysis of therapeutic options either taken individually or in combination drew a universal relationship between the use of Cyclosporine A and better outcomes as also a benefit of tocilizumab and\/or corticosteroids in critically ill patients. We present a large Spanish population-based study addressing factors influencing survival in current SARS CoV2 pandemic, with particular emphasis on the effectivity of treatments. In addition, we have generated an NN capable of identifying severity predictors of SARS CoV2. A rapid extraction and management of data protocol from eCR and artificial intelligence in-house implementations allowed us to perform almost real time monitoring of the outbreak evolution.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Heili-Frades","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Pablo Minguez","author_inst":"Genetics and Genomics Department, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Center for Biomedical Network Research on Rare Disea"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Mahillo-Fernandez","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid"},{"author_name":"Tomas Prieto-Rumeau","author_inst":"Statistics Department, National University of Distance Education, UNED, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Antonio Herrero Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Data Analytics Director, Department of Big Data analytics, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Mad"},{"author_name":"Lorena de la Fuente","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Rodriguez Nieto","author_inst":"Department Of Interstitial Pathology And Lung Function, Pulmonology Department, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron"},{"author_name":"German Peces-Barba Romero","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Mario Peces-Barba","author_inst":"ARGOZ Consultants, Av. de Manoteras, 38, 28050 Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria del Pilar Carballosa de Miguel","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Itziar Fernandez Ormaechea","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Alba Naya Prieto","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Farah Ezzine de Blas","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Luis Jimenez Hiscock","author_inst":"Thoracic Surgery Dept.

We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling), to analyse the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1st to March 29th, 2020. We extracted related clinical information upon diagnosis, progression and outcome for all COVID-19 cases, focusing in those requiring ICU admission. A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified, 52.5% males, with a mean age of 58.2 and S.D. 19.7 years. Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnoea, but all in less than half of cases. Overall, 6% of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnoea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission: those younger than 56 years, without tachypnoea, and temperature <39 C, (or >39 C without respiratory crackles), were free of ICU admission. On the contrary, COVID-19 patients aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnoea and delayed their visit to the ER after being seen in primary care. Our results show that a combination of easily obtainable clinical variables (age, fever, and tachypnoea with\/without respiratory crackles) predicts which COVID-19 patients require ICU admission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Luis Izquierdo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Spain"},{"author_name":"Julio Ancochea","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"- Savana COVID-19 Research Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Joan B Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Antonio Herrero Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Data Analytics Director, Department of Big Data analytics, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Mad"},{"author_name":"Lorena de la Fuente","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Rodriguez Nieto","author_inst":"Department Of Interstitial Pathology And Lung Function, Pulmonology Department, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron"},{"author_name":"German Peces-Barba Romero","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Mario Peces-Barba","author_inst":"ARGOZ Consultants, Av. de Manoteras, 38, 28050 Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria del Pilar Carballosa de Miguel","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Itziar Fernandez Ormaechea","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Alba Naya Prieto","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Farah Ezzine de Blas","author_inst":"Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (IIS-FJD, UAM), Quiron Salud, Madrid, CIBER de enfermedades respir"},{"author_name":"Luis Jimenez Hiscock","author_inst":"Thoracic Surgery Dept.

Vulnerability from each risk factor is quantified in terms of its equivalence to added years of age. Addition of the impact from each risk factor to an individuals true age generates their Covid-age, a summary measure representing the age of a healthy UK white male with equivalent vulnerability. We discuss important limitations of the model, including current scientific uncertainties and limitations on generalisability beyond the UK setting and its use beyond informing assessments of individual vulnerability in the workplace.

Searching for common genes by collapsing methods against 150 WES of controls of the Italian population failed to give straightforward statistically significant results with the exception of two genes. This result is not unexpected since we are facing the most challenging common disorder triggered by environmental factors with a strong underlying heritability (50%). The lesson learned from Autism-Spectrum-Disorders prompted us to re-analyse the cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following a Mendelian-like model. We identified for each patient an average of 2.5 pathogenic mutations involved in virus infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more rare disorder(s).

To explore the extent of animal-related transmission, we aggregated 17 case reports on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals as of 15 May 2020. All but two animals fully recovered and had only mild respiratory or digestive symptoms. Using data from probable cat-to-cat transmission in Wuhan, China, we estimated the basic reproduction number R0 under this scenario at 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.13). This value is much lower than the R0 reported for humans and close to one, indicating that the sustained transmission between cats is unlikely to occur. Our results support the view that the pet owners and other persons with COVID-19 in close contact with animals should be cautious of the way they interact with them.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrei R.

This meta-analysis was undertaken to provide more conclusive evidence. Methods: A systematic search for published articles was performed in PubMed and EMBASE from January 5 2020 till May 5 2020. Studies that reported the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19, stratified by the class of concomitant antihypertensive drug therapy, were included. The Mantel-Haenszel random effects model was used to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR). Results: A total of 6,997 patients with COVID-19 were included, and all of them had hypertension. The overall risk of poor patient outcomes (severe COVID-19 or death) was lower in patients taking RAAS inhibitors (OR=0.84, 95% CI: [0.73, 0.96]; P=0.017) compared with those receiving non-RAAS inhibitor antihypertensives. Patients taking angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) were less likely to experience poor clinical outcomes (OR=0.73, 95% CI: [0.58-0.92]; P=0.01) compared with those receiving angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs). In addition, comparison of ACEIs to the rest of non-ACEI antihypertensives gave a consistently decreased risk of poor COVID-19 outcome (OR=0.77, 95% CI: [0.63-0.93]; P=0.002). However, ARBs did not decrease the risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes compared to all other non-ARB antihypertensives (OR=1.13, 95% CI: [0.95-1.35]). Conclusion: The risk of developing severe illness or death from COVID-19 was lower in patients who received RAAS inhibitors compared with those who took non-RAAS inhibitors. ACEIs might be better in decreasing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 than ARBs.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yihienew Mequanint Bezabih","author_inst":"Arsi University"},{"author_name":"Alemayehu Bezabih","author_inst":"ONIRIS, Nantes, France"},{"author_name":"Endalkachew Alamneh","author_inst":"University of Tasmania, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gregory M.

Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has been proposed as a treatment of critically ill patients. Objective: To describe the association between mortality and hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study of electronic health records Setting: 13-hospital network spanning the state of New Jersey. Participants: Patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2. Follow up was through May 5, 2020. Main Outcomes: The primary outcome was death. Results: Among 2512 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 there have been 547 deaths (22%), 1539 (61%) discharges and 426 (17%) remain hospitalized. 1914 (76%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 1473 (59%) received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. After adjusting for imbalances via propensity modeling, compared to receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in associated mortality for patients receiving any hydroxychloroquine during the hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.80-1.22]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.27]), or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.75-1.28]). The 30-day unadjusted mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, the combination or neither drug was 25%, 20%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Among 547 evaluable ICU patients, including 134 receiving tocilizumab in the ICU, an exploratory analysis found a trend towards an improved survival association with tocilizumab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.57-1.00]), with 30 day unadjusted mortality with and without tocilizumab of 46% versus 56%. Conclusions: This observational cohort study suggests hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, was not associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab demonstrated a trend association towards reduced mortality among ICU patients. Our findings are limited to hospitalized patients and must be interpreted with caution while awaiting results of randomized trials.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Ip","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Donald A Berry","author_inst":"Berry Consultants, LLC"},{"author_name":"Eric Hansen","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Andre H Goy","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew L Pecora","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brittany A Sinclaire","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Urszula Bednarz","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Marafelias","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Scott M Berry","author_inst":"Berry Consultants, LLC"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Berry","author_inst":"Berry Consultants, LLC"},{"author_name":"Shivam Mathura","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Ihor S Sawczuk","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Noa Biran","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ronaldo C Go","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Steven Sperber","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Julia A Piwoz","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Bindu Balani","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Cristina Cicogna","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Rani Sebti","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Jason Zuckerman","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Keith M Rose","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Lisa Tank","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Laurie Jacobs","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Jason Korcak","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Sarah L Timmapuri","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Joseph P Underwood III","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Gregory Sugalski","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Carol Barsky","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Daniel W Varga","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Arif Asif","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Joseph C Landolfi","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20109991","rel_title":"Is there an airborne component to the transmission of COVID-19? : a quantitative analysis study","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20109991","rel_abs":"Objectives While COVID-19 is known to be spread by respiratory droplets (which travel <2m horizontally), much less is known about its transmission via aerosols, which can become airborne and widely distributed throughout room spaces. In order to quantify the risk posed by COVID-19 infectors exhaling respiratory aerosols in enclosed spaces, we undertook a computer modelling study to simulate transmission in an office building. Methods Respiratory droplet data from four published datasets were analysed to quantify the number and volume of droplets <100m diameter produced by a typical cough and speaking event (i.e. counting from 1 to 100). This was used in a stochastic model to simulate (10000 simulations) the number of respiratory particles, originating from a COVID-19 infector, that would be inhaled in one hour by a susceptible individual practicing socially distancing in a 4 x 4 x 2.5m office space. Several scenarios were simulated that mimicked the presence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 infectors. Results On average, each cough and speaking event produced similar numbers of droplets <100m diameter (median range = 971.9-1013.4). Computer simulations (ventilation rate=2AC\/h) revealed that sharing the office space with a symptomatic COVID-19 infector (4 coughs and 10 speaking events per hour) for one hour resulted in the inhalation of 16.9 (25-75th range = 8.1-33.9) aerosolised respiratory droplets, equating to about 280-1190 particles inhaled over a 35-hour working week. Sharing with an asymptomatic infector (10 speaking events per hour) resulted in the about 196-875 particles inhaled over 35 hours. Conclusions Given that live SARS-CoV-2 virions are known to be shed in high concentrations from the nasal cavity of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, the results suggest that those sharing enclosed spaces with infectors for long periods may be at risk of contracting COVID-19 by the aerosol route, even when practicing social distancing.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clive B Beggs","author_inst":"Leeds Beckett University"},{"author_name":"Donald A Berry","author_inst":"Berry Consultants, LLC"},{"author_name":"Eric Hansen","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Andre H Goy","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew L Pecora","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brittany A Sinclaire","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Urszula Bednarz","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Marafelias","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Scott M Berry","author_inst":"Berry Consultants, LLC"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Berry","author_inst":"Berry Consultants, LLC"},{"author_name":"Shivam Mathura","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Ihor S Sawczuk","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Noa Biran","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ronaldo C Go","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Steven Sperber","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Julia A Piwoz","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Bindu Balani","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Cristina Cicogna","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Rani Sebti","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Jason Zuckerman","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Keith M Rose","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Lisa Tank","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Laurie Jacobs","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Jason Korcak","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Sarah L Timmapuri","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Joseph P Underwood III","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Gregory Sugalski","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Carol Barsky","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Daniel W Varga","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Arif Asif","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Joseph C Landolfi","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20110973","rel_title":"Modelling the impact of Plasma Therapy and Immunotherapy for Recovery of COVID-19 Infected Individuals","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20110973","rel_abs":"Since the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, COVID-19 has become a pandemic causing a global economic and public health emergency. There is no known treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19 to date. Immunotherapy and plasma therapy has been used with satisfactory efficacy over the past two decades in many viral infections like SARS (Systemic Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and H1N1. Limited data from China show clinical benefit, radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival. Our aim is to create a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission and then apply various control parameters to see their effects on recovery from COVID-19 disease. We have formulated a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations, calculated basic reproduction R0, and applied five different controls (self-isolation, quarantine, herd immunity, immunotherapy, plasma therapy) to test the effectiveness of control strategy. Control optimality was checked by Lagrangian functions. Numerical simulations and bifurcation analyses were carried out. The study concludes that the COVID-19 outbreak can be controlled up to a significant level three weeks after applying all the control strategies together. These strategies lead to a reduction in hospitalization and a rise in recovery from infection. Immunotherapy is highly effective initially in hospitalized infected individuals however better results were seen in the long term with plasma therapy.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nita H Shah","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"Ankush H Suthar","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"Ekta N Jayswal","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"Nehal Shukla","author_inst":"Columbus State University"},{"author_name":"Jagdish Shukla","author_inst":"Piedmont Columbus Regional"},{"author_name":"Brittany A Sinclaire","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Urszula Bednarz","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Marafelias","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Scott M Berry","author_inst":"Berry Consultants, LLC"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Berry","author_inst":"Berry Consultants, LLC"},{"author_name":"Shivam Mathura","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Ihor S Sawczuk","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Noa Biran","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ronaldo C Go","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Steven Sperber","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Julia A Piwoz","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Bindu Balani","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Cristina Cicogna","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Rani Sebti","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Jason Zuckerman","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Keith M Rose","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Lisa Tank","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Laurie Jacobs","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Jason Korcak","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Sarah L Timmapuri","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Joseph P Underwood III","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Gregory Sugalski","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Carol Barsky","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Daniel W Varga","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Arif Asif","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Joseph C Landolfi","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20110916","rel_title":"A systems approach to inflammation identifies therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20110916","rel_abs":"Background Infection with SARS-CoV-2 manifests itself as a mild respiratory tract infection in the majority of individuals, which progresses to a severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 10-15% of patients. Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, with immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 leading to a hyperinflammatory response. A comprehensive understanding of the inflammatory process in COVID-19 is lacking. Methods In this prospective, multicenter observational study, patients with PCR-proven or clinically presumed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or clinical wards were included. Demographic and clinical data were obtained and plasma was serially collected. Concentrations of IL-6, TNF-, complement components C3a, C3c and the terminal complement complex (TCC) were determined in plasma by ELISA. Additionally, 269 circulating biomarkers were assessed using targeted proteomics. Results were compared between ICU and non ICU patients. Findings A total of 119 (38 ICU and 91 non ICU) patients were included. IL-6 plasma concentrations were elevated in COVID-19 (ICU vs. non ICU, median 174.5 pg\/ml [IQR 94.5-376.3 vs. 40.0 pg\/ml [16.5-81.0]), whereas TNF- concentrations were relatively low and not different between ICU and non ICU patients (median 24.0 pg\/ml [IQR 16.5-33.5] and 21.5 pg\/ml [IQR 16.0-33.5], respectively). C3a and terminal complement complex (TCC) concentrations were significantly higher in ICU vs. non ICU patients (median 556.0 ng\/ml [IQR 333.3-712.5]) vs. 266.5 ng\/ml [IQR 191.5-384.0 for C3a and 4506 mAU\/ml [IQR 3661-6595 vs. 3582 mAU\/ml [IQR 2947-4300] for TCC) on the first day of blood sampling. Targeted proteomics demonstrated that IL-6 (logFC 2.2), several chemokines and hepatocyte growth factor (logFC 1.4) were significantly upregulated in ICU vs. non ICU patients. In contrast, stem cell factor was significantly downregulated (logFC -1.3) in ICU vs. non ICU patients, as were DPP4 (logFC -0.4) and protein C inhibitor (log FC -1.0), the latter two factors also being involved in the regulation of the kinin-kallikrein pathway. Unsupervised clustering pointed towards a homogeneous pathogenetic mechanism in the majority of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, with patient clustering mainly based on disease severity. Interpretation We identified important pathways involved in dysregulation of inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19, including the IL-6, complement system and kinin-kallikrein pathways. Our findings may aid the development of new approaches to host-directed therapy.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frank L. van de Veerdonk","author_inst":"Radboud University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nico A.F.

The frontline warriors, namely the doctors, nurses and healthcare staff, have in many countries struggled to care for the sick under conditions of limited resources and protection and the threat of an overwhelmed healthcare system. It is during times such as this, that we draw strength and inspiration from Florence Nightingale - a passionate statistician, social reformer, feminist champion and a pioneer of modern nursing and data visualization. Nightingale's famed Florence Nightingle Diagram also known as \"coxcomb\", which was created 150 years ago and used to display the causes of death in the British Army hospital barracks, demonstrated how data visualization techniques could be a powerful medium of communication and a force for change. This paper pays tribute to Nightingale's work by using data from Bangladesh to show that the coxcomb graph is still relevant in the era of COVID-19. The coxcomb graphs that have been produced to display COVID-19 data have provided deeper insights into the trends and relative changes of variables over the course of the pandemic.

Our objective has been to identify potential markers at admission predicting the need for critical care in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia Methods: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from electronic medical records of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection by real-time RT-PCR. A comparison was made between patients staying in the hospitalization ward with those who required critical care. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to identify risk factors predicting critical care need Findings: Between March 15 and April 15, 2020, 150 patients under the age of 75 were selected (all with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection), 75 patients requiring intensive care assistance and 75 remaining the regular hospitalization ward. Most patients requiring critical care were males, 76% compared with 60% in the non-critical care group (p<0,05). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical care associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (odds ratio 1,052 (1,009-1,101); p=0,0043) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (1,968 (1,389-2,590) p<0,0001) both at the time of hospital admission.

We evaluated 9-1-1 emergency medical services (EMS) encounters for patients with COVID-19 to assess occupational exposure, programmatic strategies to reduce exposure, and PPE use. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort investigation of lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients in King County, WA who received 9-1-1 EMS responses from February 14, 2020 to March 26, 2020. We reviewed dispatch, EMS, and public health surveillance records to evaluate the temporal relationship between exposure and programmatic changes to EMS operations designed to identify high-risk patients, protect the workforce, and conserve PPE. Results There were 274 EMS encounters for 220 unique COVID-19 patients involving 700 unique EMS providers with 988 EMS person-encounters. Use of full PPE including mask, eye protection, gown and gloves (MEGG) was 67%. There were 151 person-exposures among 129 individuals, who required 981 quarantine days. Of the 700 EMS providers, 3 (0.4%) tested positive within 14 days of encounter. Programmatic changes were associated with a temporal reduction in exposures. When stratified at the study encounters midpoint, 94% (142\/151) of exposures occurred during the first 137 EMS encounters compared to 6% (9\/151) during the second 137 EMS encounters (p<0.01). By the final week of the study period, EMS deployed MEGG PPE in 34% (3579\/10,468) of all EMS person-encounters.

Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of non-pharmaceutical interventions that pushed the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this new phase of the pandemic many countries show an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time-periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until herd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new cases). Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, Dc, below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above Dc traditional epidemiological dynamics takes place, as e.g. in SIR-type models. When calibrating our corresponding model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find Dc ~ 7.2. Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household-size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with a remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters. In particular we compare the US and Austria, as examples for one country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefan Thurner","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Peter Klimek","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Rudolf Hanel","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Betty Y Yang","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Jamie M Emert","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medical Services Public Health - Seattle & King County WA"},{"author_name":"Leilani Schwarcz","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medical Services Public Health - Seattle & King County WA"},{"author_name":"Catherine R Counts","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Tracie Y Jacinto","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medical Services Public Health - Seattle & King County WA"},{"author_name":"Andrew M McCoy","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA; American Medical Response Puget Sound, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Tyler A Morgan","author_inst":"Tri-Med Ambulance, Kent WA"},{"author_name":"Jim E Whitney","author_inst":"Redmond Fire Department, Redmond WA"},{"author_name":"Joel V Bodenman","author_inst":"Kirkland Fire Department, Kirkland WA"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health - Seattle & King County WA; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Michael R Sayre","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA; Seattle Fire Department, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Thomas D Rea","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medical Services Public Health - Seattle & King County WA; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Jeroen A.

The case fatality rate varies for different strains of the virus, as do the effects on total mortality. Outbreaks related to coronavirus infections have recently become a global concern but much less is known about the dynamics of these outbreaks and their effects on mortality. In this work, disease outbreaks in Sweden, in the time period of 1860-2020, are characterized and compared to the currently ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The focus is on outbreaks with a sharp increase in all-cause mortality. Outbreak onset is defined as the time point when deaths counts starts to increase consistently for a period of 10 days. The duration of the outbreak is defined as the time period in which mortality rates are elevated. Excess mortality is estimated by standard methods. In total there were 15 outbreaks detected in the time period, the first 14 were likely caused by influenza virus infections, the last by SARS-CoV-2. The mortality dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is shown to be similar to outbreaks due to influenza virus, and in terms of the number of excess deaths, it is the worst outbreak in Sweden since the  Spanish flu of 1918-1919.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anders Ledberg","author_inst":"Stockholm university"},{"author_name":"Peter Klimek","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Rudolf Hanel","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Betty Y Yang","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Jamie M Emert","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medical Services Public Health - Seattle & King County WA"},{"author_name":"Leilani Schwarcz","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medical Services Public Health - Seattle & King County WA"},{"author_name":"Catherine R Counts","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Tracie Y Jacinto","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medical Services Public Health - Seattle & King County WA"},{"author_name":"Andrew M McCoy","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA; American Medical Response Puget Sound, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Tyler A Morgan","author_inst":"Tri-Med Ambulance, Kent WA"},{"author_name":"Jim E Whitney","author_inst":"Redmond Fire Department, Redmond WA"},{"author_name":"Joel V Bodenman","author_inst":"Kirkland Fire Department, Kirkland WA"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health - Seattle & King County WA; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Michael R Sayre","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA; Seattle Fire Department, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Thomas D Rea","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medical Services Public Health - Seattle & King County WA; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Jeroen A.

Very little research exists on the effects of social distancing measures on this pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of government implemented social distancing measures on the cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 in the United States on a state level, and in the 25 most populated cities, while adjusting for socio-demographic risk factors. The social distancing variables assessed in this study were: days to closing of non-essential business; days to stay home orders; days to restrictions on gathering, days to restaurant closings and days to school closing. Using negative binomial regression, adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated comparing two levels of a binary variable: above median value, and median value and below for days to implementing a social distancing measure. For city level data, the effects of these social distancing variables were also assessed in high (above median value) vs low (median value and below) population density cities. For the state level analysis, days to school closing was associated with cumulative incidence, with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.59 (95% CI:1.03,2.44), p=0.04 at 35 days. Some results were counterintuitive, including inverse associations between cumulative incidence and days to closure of non-essential business and restrictions on gatherings. This finding is likely due to reverse causality, where locations with slower growth rates initially chose not to implement measures, and later implemented measures when they absolutely needed to respond to increasing rates of infection. Effects of social distancing measures seemed to vary by population density in cities. Our results suggest that the effect of social distancing measures may differ between states and cities and between locations with different population densities. States and cities need individual approaches to containment of an epidemic, with an awareness of their own structure in terms of crowding and socio-economic variables. In an effort to reduce infection rates, cities may want to implement social distancing in advance of state mandates.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhuma Krishnamachari","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Andy Dsida","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Diane Zastrow","author_inst":"Palo Alto Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Brian Harper","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Alex Morris","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Anthony Santella","author_inst":"Hofstra University"},{"author_name":"Catherine R Counts","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Tracie Y Jacinto","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medical Services Public Health - Seattle & King County WA"},{"author_name":"Andrew M McCoy","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA; American Medical Response Puget Sound, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Tyler A Morgan","author_inst":"Tri-Med Ambulance, Kent WA"},{"author_name":"Jim E Whitney","author_inst":"Redmond Fire Department, Redmond WA"},{"author_name":"Joel V Bodenman","author_inst":"Kirkland Fire Department, Kirkland WA"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health - Seattle & King County WA; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Michael R Sayre","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA; Seattle Fire Department, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Thomas D Rea","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medical Services Public Health - Seattle & King County WA; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Jeroen A.

We develop an original parsimonious model that accounts for the effect of the age of infection on the natural history of the disease. Analysing the ongoing COVID-19 in France, we estimate the value of the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number (R0), and the efficiency of the national control strategy.

BACKGROUND. When the lockdowns are relaxed, the responsibility of mitigating the COVID-19 spread shifts from the governments to the individuals. To know how to conduct one-self, it is important for everyone to know the risks of transmission during the quotidian activities - meetings, meals, etc, from individuals who are known to them and looking healthy. METHODS. The detailed case-studies corresponding to 425 infections upon point-exposures over a specified duration are curated. The data from the case studies is summarized and reorganized to reflect different situations from the daily life. A meta-analysis of the attack rates of transmission and the number of infections per infected person are performed. RESULTS. The attack rates are very high in family dinners (66.7% (48.8-80.8%)) compared to sit-down dinners with lesser mixing among people eating at different tables (15.7% (12.1-20.1%)), both lasting a couple of hours. In an open workspace office floor organized in a two-half structure with shared elevators and restrooms and the employees speaking continuously, the average attack rate over the course of a few days was much higher in one half (78.7% (70.3-85.3%)) than the one for the entire floor (43.5% (37.0-50.1%)). Inferred data suggests that the transmission in elevators and trains may be lower under the conditions of using masks. In most of the instances we studied, the infected individuals spreading (35\/44) and even super-spreading (3\/6) were mostly without symptoms of coughing, sneezing or a fever. CONCLUSIONS. Although the basic reproduction number R0 is around 3.0, the number of infections caused, including the super-spreading events, seem to be limited by the number of personal interactions in a group and their proximity. By acknowledging the risks in daily life, from healthy-looking persons, one may be able to organize their interactions better to reduce the chances of spreading or super-spreading infections.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meher K Prakash","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Bastien Reyn\u00e9","author_inst":"MIVEGEC (Univ.
