This equation accounts for asymptomatic transmission, pre-symptomatic or latent transmission as well as contact tracing and isolation, and leads to a transparent definition of the instantaneous reproduction number R. For different parameter values, the model equation admits different classes of solutions. These solution classes correspond to, inter alia, containment of the outbreak via public health measures, exponential growth despite public health measures, containment despite reopening and second wave following reopening. We believe that the spread of COVID in every localized area such as a city, district or county can be accounted for by one of our solution classes. In regions where R > 1 initially despite aggressive epidemic management efforts, we find that if the mitigation measures are sustained, then it is still possible for R to dip below unity when far less than the region's entire population is affected, and from that point onwards the outbreak can be driven to extinction in time. We call this phenomenon partial herd immunity. Our analysis indicates that COVID-19 is an extremely vicious and unpredictable disease which poses unique challenges for public health authorities, on account of which case races among various countries and states do not serve any purpose and present delusive appearances while ignoring significant determinants.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B Shayak","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Mohit M Sharma","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20091322","rel_title":"A study on the appropriate use of topdown approachfor stepping up economic activities in districts ofdifferent States\/Union Territories in India","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20091322","rel_abs":"At the beginning of phase 4.0 of lockdown , every State \/Union Territories(UT) needs to take appropriate mitigation efforts (lockdown and testing ) that may change red zones to orange and even to green zones by May 31, 2020.

While most viral introductions we detected were contained with only minor transmission chains, a striking exception was an outbreak associated with a meatpacking plant in Postville, IA. In this case, a single viral introduction led to unrestrained spread within the facility, affecting many staff and members of their households. Importantly, by surveilling viral sequences from the surrounding counties, we have documented the spread of this SARS-CoV-2 substrain from this epicenter to individuals in 13 cities in 7 counties in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, a region spanning 185 square miles.

Methods: We performed validation studies according to COLA guidelines, using samples previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. We evaluated precision, analytical interferences, and cross-reactivity with other viral infections. We also evaluated concordance with molecular and other serological testing, and evaluated seroconversion. Results: The Vitros CoV2T assay exhibited acceptable precision, was resistant to analytical interference, and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with samples positive for other respiratory viruses. The CoV2T assay exhibited 100% negative predictive agreement (56\/56) and 71% positive predictive agreement (56\/79) with RT-PCR across all patient samples, and was concordant with other serological assays. Concordance with RT-PCR was 97% > 7 days after symptom onset. Conclusions: The Vitros CoV2T assay was successfully validated in our laboratory.

We estimated the number of cancelled surgical procedures in the National Health Service (NHS) in England due to COVID-19 and how this deficit would change over time once elective surgery was reintroduced. Methods: Modelling study using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data from 2014 to 2019. Using NHS England definitions, surgical procedures were grouped into four classes of urgency. We calculated time-weighted average numbers of surgical procedures from 1st March 2020 and extrapolated to 28th February 2021 informed by activity in previous years. We estimated the procedure deficit using multiple conservative assumptions and then modelled the reintroduction of elective surgery between 1st June 2020 and 28th February 2021, estimating the resources required to achieve this. Costs of surgery were calculated using NHS reference costs. Estimates are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Findings: 4,547,534 (3,318,195 - 6,250,771) patients with pooled mean age of 53.5 years were expected to undergo surgery in the NHS in England between 1st March 2020 and 28th February 2021. Due to COVID-19, 749,248 (513,565 - 1,077,448) surgical procedures were cancelled by 31st May 2020. As current guidelines require a gradual reintroduction of elective surgery, this deficit will increase further and 2,270,178 (1,453,057 - 3,363,472) patients will be awaiting surgery by 28th February 2021. The cost of these delayed procedures is {pound}4,688,318,443 ({pound}2,726,364,240 - {pound}7,070,166,056). However, the safe delivery of surgery during the pandemic will require substantial extra resources including personal protective equipment and universal preoperative screening, leading to additional costs of {pound}606,252,901 ({pound}521,159,931 - {pound}730,720,808). Interpretation: Reintroduction of elective surgery during the pandemic response in NHS England will be associated with substantial treatment delays for many patients, and a large increase in treatment costs.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander J Fowler","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, UK"},{"author_name":"Tom D Dobbs","author_inst":"Reconstructive Surgery & Regenerative Medicine Research Group, Institute of Life Sciences, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea, UK"},{"author_name":"Yize I Wan","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK."},{"author_name":"Ryan Laloo","author_inst":"Leeds Vascular Institute, Leeds General Infirmary, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hui","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK"},{"author_name":"Dmitri Nepogodiev","author_inst":"Academic Department of Surgery, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Aneel Bhangu","author_inst":"Academic Department of Surgery, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Iain Whitaker","author_inst":"Reconstructive Surgery & Regenerative Medicine Research Group, Institute of Life Sciences, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea, UK"},{"author_name":"Rupert M Pearse","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK."},{"author_name":"Tom EF Abbott","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK"},{"author_name":"Sridevi Devaraj","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"surgery"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20127290","rel_title":"Priority Setting of Ventilators in the COVID-19 Pandemic from the public's perspective","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20127290","rel_abs":"Background: Ventilator allocation plan for public health crisis should be developed through recognizing the values of society and engaging the general public. This study was conducted to assess the Iranian citizens' attitude about a number of principles and criteria for allocation of ventilators in current COVID-19 epidemic. Materials and Methods: An electronic self-administered questionnaire was publicly distributed through social networks of Telegram and WhatsApp to perform this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire consisted of 11 statements about the selection and prioritization of patients for the use of a ventilator. Results: 1262 persons, including 767 citizens and 495 health care providers participated in this study.

Now, the debates remain on whether, vertical transmission of Severe Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and antibodies against the virus do exist. We therefore, conducted a systematic review to determine the immunoglobulin G and M (IgG\/IgM) levels among infants born to mothers with COVID-19. Methods The systematic search was done using PubMed\/MEDLINE and Google Scholar database. The research included studies on IgG\/ IgM against SARS-CoV-2 among infants born to mother with COVID-19 published in English from December 1, 2019 onwards. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) guidelines. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and performed two tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to determine and compare the median IgG\/IgM levels. Results In total, 486 abstracts were screened and 63 full-text articles were assessed. Of 63 articles, 6 met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis. Two articles were included in quantitative analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/ IgM levels. The median antibody levels was 75.49AU\/mL (range: 7.25AU\/mL- 140.32AU\/mL ) and for 3.79AU\/mL (range: 0.16AU\/mL-45.83AU\/mL) (P = 0.0041) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, respectively. Conclusion There were high levels of IgG but low IgM against SARS-CoV-2 (using <10 AU\/mL as a reference range) among COVID-19 virus exposed but negative newborns. This review suggest a possible natural passive immunity (IgG\/ IgM) against COVID-19 virus.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George M.

Methods: An agent-based model, Covasim, was calibrated to the local COVID-19 epidemiological and policy environment. Contact networks were modelled to capture transmission risks in households, schools and workplaces, and a variety of community spaces (e.g. public transport, parks, bars, cafes\/restaurants) and activities (e.g. community or professional sports, large events). Policy changes that could prevent or reduce transmission in specific locations (e.g. opening\/closing businesses) were modelled in the context of interventions that included testing, contact tracing (including via a smartphone app), and quarantine. Results: Policy changes leading to the gathering of large, unstructured groups with unknown individuals (e.g. bars opening, increased public transport use) posed the greatest risk, while policy changes leading to smaller, structured gatherings with known individuals (e.g. small social gatherings) posed least risk. In the model, epidemic impact following some policy changes took more than two months to occur. Model outcomes support continuation of working from home policies to reduce public transport use, and risk mitigation strategies in the context of social venues opening, such as >30% population-uptake of a contact-tracing app, physical distancing policies within venues reducing transmissibility by >40%, or patron identification records being kept to enable >60% contact tracing. Conclusions: In a low transmission setting, care should be taken to avoid lifting sequential COVID-19 policy restrictions within short time periods, as it could take more than two months to detect the consequences of any changes. These findings have implications for other settings with low community transmission where governments are beginning to lift restrictions.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nick Scott","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Palmer","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Dominic Delport","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Romesh Abeysuriya","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Robyn Stuart","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Cliff C Kerr","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Dina Mistry","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Klein","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Rachel Sacks-Davis","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Katie Heath","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Samuel Hainsworth","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Alisa Pedrana","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark Stoove","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"David P Wilson","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Margaret Hellard","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20126359","rel_title":"Chemoprophylaxis of COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine: Astudy of health care workers attitude, adherence to regimeand side effects","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20126359","rel_abs":"Background: There are apprehensions amongst healthcare worker (HCWs) about COVID-19.

Observational studies to date lack pre-specification, transparency, rigorous ascertainment adjustment and international generalizability, with contradictory results. Methods: Using electronic health records from Spain (SIDIAP) and the United States (Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Department of Veterans Affairs), we conducted a systematic cohort study with prevalent ACE, ARB, calcium channel blocker (CCB) and thiazide diuretic (THZ) use to determine relative risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and related hospitalization outcomes. The study addressed confounding through large-scale propensity score adjustment and negative control experiments. Results: Following over 1.1 million antihypertensive users identified between November 2019 and January 2020, we observed no significant difference in relative COVID-19 diagnosis risk comparing ACE\/ARB vs CCB\/THZ monotherapy (hazard ratio: 0.98; 95% CI 0.84 - 1.14), nor any difference for mono\/combination use (1.01; 0.90 - 1.15). ACE alone and ARB alone similarly showed no relative risk difference when compared to CCB\/THZ monotherapy or mono\/combination use. Directly comparing ACE vs. ARB demonstrated a moderately lower risk with ACE, non-significant for monotherapy (0.85; 0.69 - 1.05) and marginally significant for mono\/combination users (0.88; 0.79 - 0.99). We observed, however, no significant difference between drug- classes for COVID-19 hospitalization or pneumonia risk across all comparisons. Conclusion: There is no clinically significant increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or hospitalization with ACE or ARB use. Users should not discontinue or change their treatment to avoid COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel R Morales","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Mitchell M Conover","author_inst":"Janssen Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Seng Chan You","author_inst":"Ajou University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pratt","author_inst":"University of South Australia"},{"author_name":"Kristin Kostka","author_inst":"IQVIA"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte Salles","author_inst":"IDIAPJGol"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez Bertolin","author_inst":"IDIAPJGol"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"IDIAPJGol"},{"author_name":"Scott L.

However, prior research primarily focuses on individual LTCs and there is a lack of data on the influence of multimorbidity ([&ge;]2 LTCs) on the risk of COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity, more detailed understanding of the associations with multimorbidity and COVID-19 would improve risk stratification and help protect those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Here we examine the relationships between multimorbidity, polypharmacy (a proxy of multimorbidity), and COVID-19; and how these differ by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological prognostic factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied data from UK Biobank (428,199 participants; aged 37-73; recruited 2006-2010) on self-reported LTCs, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological measures which were linked to COVID-19 test data. Poisson regression models examined risk of COVID-19 by multimorbidity\/polypharmacy and effect modification by COVID-19 prognostic factors (age\/sex\/ethnicity\/socioeconomic status\/smoking\/physical activity\/BMI\/systolic blood pressure\/renal function). 4,498 (1.05%) participants were tested; 1,324 (0.31%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared with no LTCs, relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in those with 1 LTC was no higher (RR 1.12 (CI 0.96-1.30)), whereas those with [&ge;]2 LTCs had 48% higher risk; RR 1.48 (1.28-1.71). Compared with no cardiometabolic LTCs, having 1 and [&ge;]2 cardiometabolic LTCs had a higher risk of COVID-19; RR 1.28 (1.12-1.46) and 1.77 (1.46-2.15), respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with a dose response increased risk of COVID-19. All prognostic factors were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in multimorbidity; being non-white, most socioeconomically deprived, BMI [&ge;]40 kg\/m2, and reduced renal function were associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection: RR 2.81 (2.09-3.78); 2.79 (2.00-3.90); 2.66 (1.88-3.76); 2.13 (1.46-3.12), respectively. No multiplicative interaction between multimorbidity and prognostic factors was identified. Important limitations include the low proportion of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 test data (1.05%) and UK Biobank participants being more affluent, healthier and less ethnically diverse than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing multimorbidity, especially cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and polypharmacy are associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Those with multimorbidity and additional factors, such as non-white ethnicity, are at heightened risk of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ross McQueenie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Instutute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Hamish Foster","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Instutute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Naveed Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Claire L Niedzwiedz","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Claire E Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Jana Anderson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Patrick B Mark","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Michael Sullivan","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Christophe G.

Methods: Prospective analysis of registry data describing patients admitted to five acute NHS Hospitals in east London, UK for COVID-19. Emergency hospital admissions with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 aged 16 years or over were included. Data, including ethnicity, social deprivation, frailty, patient care and detailed risk factors for mortality, were extracted from hospital electronic records. Multivariable survival analysis was used to assess associations between ethnic group and mortality accounting for the effects of age, sex and various other risk factors. Results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Findings: 1996 adult patients were admitted between 1st March and 13th May 2020. After excluding 259 patients with missing ethnicity data, 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) Black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared to white patients, those from BAME backgrounds were younger, with differing co-morbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to intensive care and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, [1.06-2.23]; p=0.023 and 1.80 [1.20-2.71]; p=0.005, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian (HR 1.49 [1.19-1.86]; p<0.001) and black (HR 1.30 [1.02-1.65]; p=0.036) backgrounds were more likely to die. These findings persisted across a range of risk-factor adjusted analyses. Interpretation: Patients from Asian and Black backgrounds are more likely to die from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders. Higher rates of invasive ventilation in intensive care indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and Black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vanessa J Apea","author_inst":"Department of Infection and Immunity, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust; Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Yize I Wan","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Rageshri Dhairyawan","author_inst":"Department of Infection and Immunity, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust; Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Zudin A Puthucheary","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Rupert M Pearse","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Chloe M Orkin","author_inst":"Department of Infection and Immunity, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust; Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"John R Prowle","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Claire L Niedzwiedz","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Claire E Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Jana Anderson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Patrick B Mark","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Michael Sullivan","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Christophe G.

In this quasi-experimental study, we modelled the temporal trends in human mobility and epidemics of COVID-19 in the 27 EU states between January 15 and May 9, 2020. COVID-19 and human mobility had 3 trend-segments, including an upward trend in COVID-19 daily incidence and a downward trend in most human mobilities in the middle segment. Compared with the EU states farther from Italy, the state-wide lockdown dates were more likely linked to turning points of human mobilities in the EU states closer to Italy, which were also more likely linked to second turning points of COVID-19 epidemics. Among the examined human mobilities, the second turning points in driving mobility and the first turning points in parks mobility were the best factors that connected lockdown dates and COVID-19 epidemics in the EU states closer to Italy.

Studies have suggested that there is a direct relationship between environmental issues and population density with cases of COVID-19. In this sense, this research aims to analyze, through correlational study and Krigagem, the relationship of meteorological and demographic variables with cases of COVID-19 in regions of subtropical climate in Brazil. The results suggest that population and demographic density (hab\/km2) are risk factors for the spread of SAR-CoV-2 and an increase in the daily case record of COVID-19. The distribution of cases according to age group did not present a significant disparity between men and women. Relative humidity (RH)%, average temperature Celsius, minimum temperature Celsius, maximum temperature Celsius, wind speed m\/s and daily precipitation (rain) mm show negative relationships with cases of COVID-19 in regions of humid equatorial climate. Analysis between associations of environmental factors, wind, temperature and HR in a region is extremely important to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. In the northern region of Brazil, low wind speed, high temperatures and high RH are observed, environmental factors that, when associated, reduce the transmission process because it hinders the movement of the virus in the environment. In this sense, it is suggested that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in this region is disseminated through fluids in the air between man\/man and by contact between objects\/men. Therefore, strategic public policies to combat the pandemic must consider the environmental factors of the regions involved and control and\/or blocking the transit of people.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felix Lelis da Silva","author_inst":"Federal Institute of Education Science and Tecnology of Par"},{"author_name":"Maryjane Diniz A.

Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, we found that the unitary state system was counter-intuitively positively associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Blood type B was a protective factor for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV, influenza and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Obesity and the condition of unimproved water sources were associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, and vitamin D intake.

To date, there are few empirical estimates of IFR published due to challenges in measuring infection rates. Outside of closed, closely surveilled populations where infection rates can be monitored through viral surveillance, we must rely on indirect measures of infection, like specific antibodies. Representative seroprevalence studies provide an important avenue for estimating the number of infections in a community, and when combined with death counts can lead to robust estimates of the IFR. We estimated overall and age-specific IFR for the canton of Geneva, Switzerland using age-stratified daily case and death incidence reports combined with five weekly population-based seroprevalence estimates. From February 24th to June 2nd there were 5'039 confirmed cases and 286 reported deaths within Geneva (population of 506'765). We inferred age-stratified (5-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-65 and 65+) IFRs by linking the observed number of deaths to the estimated number of infected individuals from each serosurvey. We account for the delays between infection and seroconversion as well as between infection and death. Inference is drawn in a Bayesian framework that incorporates uncertainty in seroprevalence estimates (supplement). Of the 286 reported deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, the youngest person to die was 31 years old. Infected individuals younger than 50 years experienced statistically similar IFRs (range 0.00032-0.0016%), which increases to 0.14% (95% CrI 0.096-0.19) for those 50-64 years old to 5.6% (95% CrI 4.3-7.4) for those 65 years and older (supplement). After accounting for demography and age-specific seroprevalence, we estimate a population-wide IFR of 0.64% (95% CrI 0.38-0.98). Our results are subject to two notable limitations. Among the 65+ age group that died of COVID-19 within Geneva, 50% were reported among residents of assisted care facilities, where around 0.8% of the Geneva population resides. While the serosurvey protocol did not explicitly exclude these individuals, they are likely to have been under-represented. This would lead to an overestimation of the IFR in the 65+ age group if seroprevalence in this institutionalized population was higher than in the general population (supplement). Further, our IFR estimates are based on current evidence regarding post-infection antibody kinetics, which may differ between severe and mild infections. If mild infections have significantly lower and short-lived antibody responses, our estimates of IFR may be biased upwards. Estimates of IFR are key for understanding the true pandemic burden and for weighing different risk reduction strategies. The IFR is not solely determined by host and pathogen biology, but also by the capacity of health systems to treat severe cases. Despite having among the highest per capita incidence in Switzerland, Geneva's health system accommodated the influx of cases needing intensive care (peak of 80\/110 ICU-beds including surge capacity) while maintaining care quality standards. As such, our IFR estimates can be seen as a best-case scenario with respect to health system capacity. Our results reveal that population-wide estimates of IFR mask great heterogeneity by age and point towards the importance of age-targeted interventions to reduce exposures among those at highest risk of death.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier Perez-Saez","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Lauer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Simon Regard","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Delaporte","author_inst":"General Directorate for Health, Geneva"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"- Serocov-POP Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Cai Chen","author_inst":"University of California"},{"author_name":"Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Pinghu hospital of Shenzhen university"},{"author_name":"Xiaosheng Wang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Christophe G.

However, social distancing rules have put the use of public spaces in densely populated places under strain, and this is especially important as some of the most virulent outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic have been in compact cities. It is therefore fundamental to take into account each neighbourhood's morphological characteristics and the potential population densities each street, square or park can accommodate under such new regulations in order to effectively enforce social distancing rules. Otherwise, certain areas may be rapidly overwhelmed by crowds with citizens unable to maintain the minimum safe distance between individuals. In this paper, we develop a method to identify the potential public space accessibility if social distancing rules are followed and we apply it to three global and highly affected by COVID-19 cities. Our research finds that, at micro level there are important inequalities between neighbourhoods, so people will struggle to comply with social distancing rules and consequently it will make controlling infection rates more difficult.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandre Nobajas","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Joan Ganau i Casas","author_inst":"Universitat de Lleida"},{"author_name":"Daniel Paul i Agusti","author_inst":"Universitat de Lleida"},{"author_name":"Adam J Peacock","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Delaporte","author_inst":"General Directorate for Health, Geneva"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"- Serocov-POP Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Cai Chen","author_inst":"University of California"},{"author_name":"Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Pinghu hospital of Shenzhen university"},{"author_name":"Xiaosheng Wang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Christophe G.

It is our firm believe that this Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 tracker can be extended to other domains such as the monitoring\/tracking of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in addition to monitoring and tracking pandemics.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Amo-Boateng","author_inst":"University of Energy and Natural Resources"},{"author_name":"Joan Ganau i Casas","author_inst":"Universitat de Lleida"},{"author_name":"Daniel Paul i Agusti","author_inst":"Universitat de Lleida"},{"author_name":"Adam J Peacock","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Delaporte","author_inst":"General Directorate for Health, Geneva"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"- Serocov-POP Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Cai Chen","author_inst":"University of California"},{"author_name":"Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Pinghu hospital of Shenzhen university"},{"author_name":"Xiaosheng Wang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Christophe G.

Objective To determine whether it is feasible and safe to continue non-emergency surgery in the COVID-19 pandemic Design, setting and participants This is a cohort study of 500 consecutive patients undergoing non-emergency surgery in a dedicated COVID-19 cold site following the first case of COVID-19 that was reported in the institution. The study was carried out during the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom, which currently has one of the highest number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 globally. We set up a hub-and-spoke surgical network amongst 14 National Health Service institutions during the pandemic. The hub was a cancer centre, which was converted into a COVID-19 cold site, performing urological, thoracic, gynaecological and general surgical operations. Outcomes The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and post-operative complications at 30-days. Results 500 patients underwent surgery with median age 62.5 (IQR 51-71). 65% were male and 60% had a known diagnosis of cancer. 44% of surgeries were performed with robotic or laparoscopic assistance and 61% were considered complex or major operations. None of the 500 patients undergoing surgery died from COVID-19 at 30-days. 30-day all-cause mortality was 3\/500 (1%). 10 (2%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 4 (1%) with confirmed laboratory diagnosis and 6 (1%) with probable COVID-19. 33\/500 (7%) of patients developed Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher complications, with 1\/33 (3%) occurring in a patient with COVID-19. Conclusion It is safe to continue non-emergency surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic with appropriate service reconfiguration.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veeru Kasivisvanathan","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lindsay","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sara Rakhshani-moghadam","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Elhamshary","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Kapriniotis","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Georgios Kazantzis","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bilal Syed","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"John Hines","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Axel Bex","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Daniel Heffernan Ho","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin Hayward","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chetan Bhan","author_inst":"Whittington Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicola MacDonald","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Clarke","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"David Walker","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Bellingan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Moore","author_inst":"NHS England and NHS Improvement"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Rohn","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Asif Muneer","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lois Roberts","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fares Haddad","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"John D Kelly","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter R.

Their conclusion was based on misunderstandings of the datasets. Each of these estimated risk relative to that incurred when touching infected individuals. Allowing for this suggests that the main advantage of social distancing, a perhaps 78% (95% CI 24, 92) reduction in risk of infection, occurs at distances below 1m. The data imply an 11% chance of further distances reducing the risk, with any effects likely to be small. However the limitations of the dataset do limit the strength of these conclusions.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mike Lonergan","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lindsay","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sara Rakhshani-moghadam","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Elhamshary","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Kapriniotis","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Georgios Kazantzis","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bilal Syed","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"John Hines","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Axel Bex","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Daniel Heffernan Ho","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin Hayward","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chetan Bhan","author_inst":"Whittington Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicola MacDonald","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Clarke","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"David Walker","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Bellingan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Moore","author_inst":"NHS England and NHS Improvement"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Rohn","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Asif Muneer","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lois Roberts","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fares Haddad","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"John D Kelly","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter R.
