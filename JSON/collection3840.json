Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search of electronic information was conducted to identify studies comparing the diagnostic performance within the same patient cohort of chest CT scan versus RT-PCR in COVID-19 suspected cases. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included other test performance characteristics, discrepant findings between both investigations and main chest CT findings. Random effects modelling was used for the analyses. Results Thirteen non-randomised studies enrolling 4092 patients were identified. Accuracy was statistically significantly higher for RT-PCR versus chest CT (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.22, P = 0.001). Chest CT is also less specific than RT-PCR. Ground-glass opacities and consolidations were the most common chest CT manifestations. Importantly, early small studies tended to favour chest CT versus later larger studies. Conclusion Chest CT is inferior to RT-PCR for the initial detection of COVID-19 and has more false positives. It may still be useful in confirming COVID-19, however, in patients with a suspicious clinical presentation, but who have a false-negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Karam","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Sulaiman Althuwaikh","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Alazemi","author_inst":"School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Abul","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Amrit Hayre","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Abdulmalik Alsaif","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Barlow Gavin","author_inst":"Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137695","rel_title":"Serologic cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with endemic and seasonal Betacoronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137695","rel_abs":"In order to properly understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of humoral immunity, researchers have evaluated the presence of serum antibodies of people worldwide experiencing the pandemic.

Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we detected the potential cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 towards the four other coronaviruses, with the strongest cross-recognition between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS \/MERS-CoV antibodies, as expected based on sequence homology of their respective spike proteins. Further analysis of cross-reactivity could provide informative data that could lead to intelligently designed pan-coronavirus therapeutics or vaccines.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer Hicks","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Carleen Klumpp-Thomas","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Heather Kalish","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Anandakumar Shunmugavel","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Mehalko","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"John-Paul Denson","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kelly Snead","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Matthew Drew","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kizzmekia Corbett","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Barney Graham","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137729","rel_title":"Association Between Nursing Home Crowding and COVID-19 Infection and Mortality in Ontario, Canada","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137729","rel_abs":"Importance: Nursing home residents have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic. Prevention recommendations have emphasized frequent testing of healthcare personnel and residents, but additional strategies are needed to protect nursing home residents. Objective: We developed a reproducible index of nursing home crowding and determined whether crowding was associated with incidence of COVID-19 in the first months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based retrospective cohort study of over 78,000 residents of 618 distinct nursing homes in Ontario, Canada from March 29 to May 20, 2020. Exposure: The nursing home crowding index equalled the average number of residents per bedroom and bathroom. Outcomes: Primary outcomes included the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infection and mortality, per 100 residents; introduction of COVID-19 into a home (>=1 resident case) was a negative tracer. Results: Of 623 homes in Ontario, we obtained complete information on 618 homes (99%) housing 78,607 residents. A total of 5,218 residents (6.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, and 1,452 (1.8%) died with COVID-19 infection as of May 20, 2020. COVID-19 infection was distributed unevenly across nursing homes: 4,496 (86%) of infections occurred in just 63 (10%) of homes. The crowding index ranged across homes from 1.3 (mainly single-occupancy rooms) to 4.0 (exclusively quadruple occupancy rooms); 308 (50%) homes had high crowding index (>=2). Incidence in high crowding index homes was 9.7%, versus 4.5% in low crowding index homes (p<0.001), while COVID-19 mortality was 2.7%, versus 1.3%. The likelihood of COVID-19 introduction did not differ (31.3% vs 30.2%, p=0.79). After adjustment for regional, nursing home, and resident covariates, the crowding index remained associated with increased risk of infection (RR=1.72, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.11-2.65) and mortality (RR=1.72, 95%CI: 1.03-2.86). Propensity score analysis yielded similar conclusions for infection (RR=2.06, 95%CI: 1.34-3.17) and mortality (RR=2.09, 95%CI: 1.30-3.38). Simulations suggested that converting all 4-bed rooms to 2-bed rooms would have averted 988 (18.9%) infections of COVID-19 and 271 (18.7%) deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: Crowding was associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Reducing crowding in nursing homes could prevent future COVID-19 mortality.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin A Brown","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jones","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Nick Daneman","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adrienne K Chan","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kevin L Schwartz","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Gary E Garber","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Andrew Costa","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Nathan M Stall","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Kizzmekia Corbett","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Barney Graham","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137745","rel_title":"Face mask wearing rate predicts country's COVID-19 death rates","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137745","rel_abs":"Identification of biomedical and socioeconomic predictors for the number of deaths by COVID-19 among countries will lead to the development of effective intervention. While previous multiple regression studies have identified several predictors for the number of COVID-19-related deaths, little is known for the association with mask non-wearing rate possibly because the data is available for limited number of countries, which constricts the application of traditional multiple regression approach to screen a large number of potential predictors. In this study, we used the hypothesis-driven regression approach to test the association with limited number of predictors based on the hypothesis that the mask non-wearing rate can predict the number of deaths to a large extent together with age and BMI, other relatively independent risk factors for hospitalized patients of COVID-19. The mask non-wearing rate, percentage of age [&ge;] 80 (male), and male BMI showed Spearman's correlations up to about 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6, respectively, with the numbers of deaths per million in 22 countries from mid-March to mid-June, 2020. The observed numbers of deaths per million were significantly correlated with those predicted by the lasso regression model including four predictors, age [&ge;] 80 (male), male BMI, and mask non-wearing rates from mid-March and late April to early May (Pearson's coefficient = 0.919). The multiple linear regression models including the mask non-wearing rates, age, and obesity-related predictors explained up to 75% variation of the number of deaths per million in the 22 countries with little concerns about multicollinearity. Furthermore, linear regressions using the mask non-wearing rate in mid-March as the sole predictor still explained up to 72% of the variation of the numbers of deaths from March to mid-June, emphasizing the importance of the strongest predictor. Although further verification is needed to identify causes of the national differences in COVID-19 mortality rates, these findings highlight the importance of the mask, age, and BMI in predicting the COVID-19-related deaths, providing a useful strategy for future regression analyses that attempt to contribute to the mechanistic understanding of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daisuke Miyazawa","author_inst":"Miyazawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gen Kaneko","author_inst":"School of Arts & Sciences, University of Houston-Victoria"},{"author_name":"Nick Daneman","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adrienne K Chan","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kevin L Schwartz","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Gary E Garber","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Andrew Costa","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Nathan M Stall","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Kizzmekia Corbett","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Barney Graham","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137620","rel_title":"Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among health care workers in a country with low burden of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137620","rel_abs":"Greece is a country with limited spread of SARS-CoV-2 and cumulative infection attack rate of 0.12% (95%CI 0.06%-0.26%).

We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among health care workers at a large acute care hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. We determined correlations between seroprevalence, self-reported symptoms and occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Methods and findings: All employees at Danderyd Hospital (n=4375) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study. 2149 employees from all hospital departments were enrolled in the study between April 14th and May 8th 2020. Study participants completed a questionnaire consisting of symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection since January 2020 and occupational exposure to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed using a multiplex assay evaluated to have 99.4% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. The over-all seroprevalence among 2149 participants was 19.1% (n=410). There was no difference in age or sex between seropositive and seronegative participants. The symptoms with the strongest correlation to seroprevalence were anosmia and ageusia, with odds ratios of 28.4 (p=2.02*10^-120) and 19.2 (p=1.67*10^-99) respectively. Seroprevalence was strongly associated with patient-related work (OR 2.9, p=4.24*10^-8), covid-19 patient contact (OR 1.43, p=0.003), and occupation as assisting nurse (OR 3.67, p=2.16*10^-9). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that anosmia and ageusia should be included in screening guidance and in the recommendations of self-isolation to reduce further spread of SARS-CoV-2. The results furthermore imply an occupational health risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital workers. Continued measures are warranted to assure healthcare worker safety and reduce transmission from health care settings to the community during the covid-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ann-Sofie Rudberg","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Havervall","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Anna Manberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"August Jernbom Falk","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Katherina Aguilera","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henry Ng","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Lena Gabrielsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ann-Christin Salomonsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Leo Hanke","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murell","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Jennie Olofsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Eni Andersson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Hellstrom","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Shaghayegh Bayati","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sofia Bergstrom","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pin","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ronald Sjoberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanna Tegel","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137588","rel_title":"The impact of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions on the future dynamics of endemic infections","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137588","rel_abs":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been employed to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, yet these measures are already having similar effects on other directly-transmitted, endemic diseases. Disruptions to the seasonal transmission patterns of these diseases may have consequences for the timing and severity of future outbreaks. Here we consider the implications of SARS-CoV-2 NPIs for two endemic infections circulating in the United States of America (USA): respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and seasonal influenza. Using laboratory surveillance data from 2020, we estimate that RSV transmission declined by at least 20% in the USA at the start of the NPI period. We simulate future trajectories of both RSV and influenza, using an epidemic model. As susceptibility increases over the NPI period, we find that substantial outbreaks of RSV may occur in future years, with peak outbreaks likely occurring in the winter of 2021-2022. Results for influenza broadly echo this picture, but are more uncertain; future outbreaks are likely dependent on the transmissibility and evolutionary dynamics of circulating strains.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel E.

The latter allows to take into account the variation of infectiousness as a function of time since infection. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a vaccine or treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.} social distancing) are of great importance to mitigate the pandemic. We propose a model with a double continuous structure by host age and time since infection. By applying optimal control theory to our age-structured model, we identify a solution minimizing deaths and costs associated with the implementation of the control strategy itself. This strategy depends on the age heterogeneity between individuals and consists in a relatively high isolation intensity over the older populations during a hundred days, followed by a steady decrease in a way that depends on the cost associated to a such control. The isolation of the younger population is weaker and occurs only if the cost associated with the control is relatively low. We show that the optimal control strategy strongly outperforms other strategies such as uniform constant control over the whole populations or over its younger fraction. These results bring new facts the debate about age-based control interventions and open promising avenues of research, for instance of age-based contact tracing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quentin Richard","author_inst":"IRD"},{"author_name":"Samuel Alizon","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"Marc Choisy","author_inst":"IRD"},{"author_name":"Mircea T.

Methods and findings: The Corona Sao Caetano program is a primary care initiative offering COVID-19 care to all residents of Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil. After triage of potentially severe cases, consecutive patients presenting between 13th April and 13th May 2020 were tested at home with SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR; positive patients were followed up for 14 days. RT-PCR-negative patients were offered SARS-CoV-2 serology. We describe the clinical features, virology and natural history of this prospective population-based cohort. Of 2,073 suspected COVID-19 cases, 1,583 (76.4%) were tested by RT-PCR, of whom 444 (28.0%, 95%CI: 25.9% - 30.3%) were positive; 604\/1,136 (53%) RT-PCR-negative patients underwent serology, of whom 52 (8.6%) tested SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were cough, fatigue, myalgia and headache; whereas self-reported fever, anosmia, and ageusia were most associated with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. RT-PCR cycle thresholds were lower in men, older patients, those with fever and arthralgia, and around symptom onset. The rates of hospitalization and death among 444 RT-PCR-positive cases were 6.7% and 0.7%, respectively, with older age and obesity more frequent in the hospitalized group. Conclusions: COVID-19 presents similarly to other mild respiratory disease in primary care. Some symptoms assist the differential diagnosis. Most patients can be managed at home.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabio E Leal","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maria C Mendes-Correa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lewis F Buss","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49)  and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sa"},{"author_name":"Silvia F Costa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Joao CS Bizario","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sonia RP Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Osorio Thomaz","author_inst":"Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnologicas do Estado de Sao Paulo - IPT"},{"author_name":"Tania R Tozetto-Mendoza","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lucy S Villas-Boas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lea CO Silva","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Regina MZ Grespan","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Rua Santo Antonio, Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ligia Capuani","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Renata Buccheri","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Helves Domingues","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Neal DE Alexander","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Philippe Mayaud","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49)  and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sa"},{"author_name":"Ronald Sjoberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanna Tegel","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137901","rel_title":"Factors associated with self-reported anxiety, depression, and general health during the UK lockdown; a cross-sectional survey","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137901","rel_abs":"Background: To investigate factors associated with anxiety, depression, and self-reported general health during \"lockdown\" due to COVID-19 in the UK. Methods: Online cross-sectional survey of a nationally-representative sample of 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over (data collected 6-7 May 2020). Participants were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. Outcomes: In this sample, 21.9% (n=458, 95% CI [20.1% to 23.7%]) reported probable anxiety (scored three or over on the GAD-2); while 23.5% (n=494, 95% CI [21.7% to 25.3]) reported probable depression (scored three or over on the PHQ-2). Poorer mental health was associated with greater financial hardship during the lockdown, thinking that you would lose contact with friends or family if you followed Government measures, more conflict with household members during the lockdown, less sense of community with people in your neighbourhood, and lower perceived effectiveness of Government measures. Females and those who were younger were likely to report higher levels of anxiety and depression. The majority of participants reported their general health as \"good\" (as measured by the first item of the SF-36). Poorer self-reported general health was associated with psychological distress, greater worry about COVID-19 and markers of inequality. Interpretation: Rates of self-reported anxiety and depression in the UK during the lockdown were greater than population norms. Reducing financial hardship, promoting social connectedness, and increasing solidarity with neighbours and household members may help ease rifts within the community which are associated with distress, thereby improving mental health. Reducing inequality may also improve general health.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise E.

It has been responsible for over four hundred thousand death worldwide to date. There has been evidence that various comorbidities have a higher risk associated with case fatality. Although COVID-19 is a viral disease, there might be an association between different comorbidities and the occurrence of the disease. Method: Sociodemographic and medical history data on different comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, liver disease, lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and obesity were collected by a web-based self-reported survey between 25th March 2020 to 4th June 2020 by the Nexoid United Kingdom. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done using these risk factors as independent variables. Result: A total of 780,961 participants from 183 different countries and territories participated in this study. Among them, 1516 participants were diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to this study. A significant risk association was observed for age above 60 years, female gender as well as different pre-existing disease conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, and heart diseases. Asthma and diabetes were the major dominant comorbidities among patients, and patients with existing diabetes were 1.464 (AOR: 1.464; 95% CI: 1.228-1.744), more likely to develop the disease than others who did not diagnose as diseased. Conclusion: Older adults, female as well as people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, kidney disease, and liver disease, are the most vulnerable population for COVID-19. However, further studies should be carried out to explain the pathway of these risk associations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Rahanur Alam","author_inst":"Department of Food Technology and Nutrition Science, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

However, building a robust image classification model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, we called Self Supervised Super Sample Decomposition for Transfer learning (4S-DT) model. 4S-DT encourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is a novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample decomposition of unlabelled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT helps in improving the robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with a class decomposition layer to simplify the local structure of the data. 4S-DT can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a downstream classdecomposition mechanism. We used 50,000 unlabelled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. 4S-DT has achieved a high accuracy of 99:8% (95% CI: 99.44 %, 99.98%) in the detection of COVID-19 cases on a large dataset and an accuracy of 97:54% (95% CI: 96.22%, 98.91%) on an extended test set enriched by augmented images of a small dataset, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected, which was the highest accuracy obtained when compared to other methods.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asmaa Abbas","author_inst":"Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Abdelsamea","author_inst":"Birmingham City University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Gaber","author_inst":"Birmingham City University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Robin","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tania R Tozetto-Mendoza","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lucy S Villas-Boas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lea CO Silva","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Regina MZ Grespan","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Rua Santo Antonio, Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ligia Capuani","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Renata Buccheri","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Helves Domingues","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Neal DE Alexander","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Philippe Mayaud","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49)  and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sa"},{"author_name":"Ronald Sjoberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanna Tegel","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137257","rel_title":"Cost-effectiveness and return on investment of protecting health workers in low- and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137257","rel_abs":"Background: In this paper, we predict the health and economic consequences of immediate investment in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers (HCWs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: To account for health consequences, we estimated mortality for health care workers (HCW), and present a cost-effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) analysis using a decision-analytic model with Bayesian multivariate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Inputs were used from the World Health Organization Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool and the Imperial College of London epidemiologic model. Results: An investment of $9.6 billion USD would adequately protect HCWs in all LMICs. This intervention saves 2,299,543 lives across LMICs, costing $59 USD per HCW case averted and $4,309 USD per HCW life saved. The societal ROI is $755.3 billion USD, the equivalent of a 7,932% return. Regional and national estimates are also presented. In scenarios where PPE remains scarce, 70-100% of HCWs will get infected, irrespective of nationwide social distancing policies. Maintaining HCW infection rates below 10% and mortality below 1% requires inclusion of a PPE scale-up strategy as part of the pandemic response. Discussion: In conclusion, wide-scale procurement and distribution of PPE for LMICs is an essential strategy to prevent widespread HCW morbidity and mortality. It is cost-effective and yields a large downstream ROI.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas Risko","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Kalin Werner","author_inst":"University of Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"O Agatha Offorjebe","author_inst":"University of South California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, USA"},{"author_name":"Andres I Vecino-Ortiz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lee A Wallis","author_inst":"University of Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Junaid Razzak","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Schoolof Medicine"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tania R Tozetto-Mendoza","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lucy S Villas-Boas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lea CO Silva","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Regina MZ Grespan","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Rua Santo Antonio, Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ligia Capuani","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Renata Buccheri","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Helves Domingues","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Neal DE Alexander","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Philippe Mayaud","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49)  and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sa"},{"author_name":"Ronald Sjoberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanna Tegel","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137133","rel_title":"Qualitative forecast and temporal evolution ofthe disease spreading using a simplified modeland COVID-19 data for Italy","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137133","rel_abs":"In a previous paper a simplified SEIR model applied to COVID-19 cases detected in Italy, including the lockdown period, has shown a good fitting to the time evolution of the disease during the observed period.

The values obtained are to be considered indicative. The same model has been applied both to the data relating to Italy and to some italian regions generally finding good qualitative results. The only tuning parameter in the model is the 'incubation period'. In this modelization the tuning parameter, together with the calculated growth rate of the exponential curve used to approximate the early stage data, are in strong relationship with the compartments' transfer rates. The relationships between the parameters simplify modeling by allowing a rough (not supported by statistical considerations) forecast of the time evolution, starting from the first period of growth of the diffusion.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberto Simeone","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Kalin Werner","author_inst":"University of Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"O Agatha Offorjebe","author_inst":"University of South California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, USA"},{"author_name":"Andres I Vecino-Ortiz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lee A Wallis","author_inst":"University of Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Junaid Razzak","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Schoolof Medicine"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tania R Tozetto-Mendoza","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lucy S Villas-Boas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Lea CO Silva","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Regina MZ Grespan","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul (USCS), Rua Santo Antonio, Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ligia Capuani","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Renata Buccheri","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49) and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao"},{"author_name":"Helves Domingues","author_inst":"Modular Research System, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Neal DE Alexander","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Philippe Mayaud","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical (LIM-52, LIM-46, LIM-49)  and Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sa"},{"author_name":"Ronald Sjoberg","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanna Tegel","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137596","rel_title":"Platelets can contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA and are hyperactivated in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137596","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Rationale: In addition to the overwhelming lung inflammation that prevails in COVID-19, hypercoagulation and thrombosis contribute to the lethality of subjects infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Platelets are chiefly implicated in thrombosis. Moreover, they can interact with viruses and are an important source of inflammatory mediators. While a lower platelet count is associated with severity and mortality, little is known about platelet function during COVID-19. Objective: To evaluate the contribution of platelets to inflammation and thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods and Results: We document the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in platelets of COVID-19 patients. Exhaustive assessment of cytokines in plasma and in platelets revealed the modulation of platelet-associated cytokine levels in COVID-19, pointing to a direct contribution of platelets to the plasmatic cytokine load. Moreover, we demonstrate that platelets release their alpha- and dense-granule contents and phosphatidylserine-exposing extracellular vesicles. Functionally, platelets were hyperactivated in COVID-19 subjects, with aggregation occurring at suboptimal thrombin concentrations. Furthermore, platelets adhered more efficiently onto collagen-coated surfaces under flow conditions. Conclusions: These data suggest that platelets could participate in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and in the overwhelming thrombo-inflammation observed in COVID-19. Thus, blockade of platelet activation pathways may improve outcomes in this disease.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Younes Zaid","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital; Mohammed V University"},{"author_name":"Florian Puhm","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Allaeys","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Abdallah Naya","author_inst":"Hassan II University"},{"author_name":"Mounia Oudghiri","author_inst":"Hassan II University"},{"author_name":"Loubna Khalki","author_inst":"Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS)"},{"author_name":"Youness Limami","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nabil Zaid","author_inst":"Mohammed V University"},{"author_name":"Khalid Sadki","author_inst":"Mohammed V University"},{"author_name":"Rafiqua Ben El Haj","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wissal Maher","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lamiae Belayachi","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bouchra Belefquih","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amina Benouda","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amine Cheikh","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yahia Cherrah","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Louis Flamand","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Fadila Guessous","author_inst":"Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Eric Boilard","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137521","rel_title":"SARS CoV-2 Serosurvey in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137521","rel_abs":"In a serosurvey of asymptomatic people recruited from a clinical laboratory in the general population in May, 2020 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia three out of 99 persons tested positive for SARS CoV-2 IgG (3.03%, 95% binomial exact confidence interval: 0.63%-8.6%).

This paper compares the dynamics of virus-receptor interactions for SARS-CoV (CoV1) and CoV2. At low (endosomal) pH, the binding free energy landscape of CoV1 and CoV2 interactions with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is almost the same. However, at neutral pH the landscape is different due to the loss of a pH-switch (His445Lys) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of CoV2 relative to CoV1. Namely, CoV1 stabilizes a transition state above the bound state. In situations where small external strains are applied by, say, shear flow in the respiratory system, the off rate of the viral particle is enhanced. As a result, CoV1 virions are expected to detach from cell surfaces in time scales that are much faster than the time needed for other receptors to reach out and stabilize virus attachment. On the other hand, the loss of this pH-switch, which sequence alignments show is unique to CoV2, eliminates the transition state and allows the virus to stay bound to the ACE2 receptor for time scales compatible with the recruitment of additional ACE2 receptors diffusing in the cell membrane. This has important implications for viral infection and its pathology. CoV1 does not trigger high infectivity in the nasal area because it either rapidly drifts down the respiratory tract or is exhaled. By contrast, this novel mutation in CoV2 should not only retain the infection in the nasal cavity until ACE2-rich cells are sufficiently depleted, but also require fewer particles for infection. This mechanism explains observed longer incubation times, extended period of viral shedding, and higher rate of transmission. These considerations governing viral entry suggest that number of ACE2-rich cells in human nasal mucosa, which should be significantly smaller for children (and females relative to males), should also correlate with onset of viral load that could be a determinant of higher virus susceptibility. Critical implications for the development of new vaccines to combat current and future pandemics that, like SARS-CoV2, export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates by viral retention in nasal epithelium are also discussed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos J.

Here, we propose climate plays an important role in the evolution of SARS CoV-2 and the spread of COVID-19 all over the world which was previously not known. To understand the climatic factors responsible for shaping the molecular determinants of the novel coronavirus, genotyping SARS CoV-2 across different latitudes and Koppens climate is imperative. It seems this virus follows inverse latitudinal biodiversity gradient due to its preference towards Koppens temperate (C) and cold climate (D). Our molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed division of 176 SARS CoV-2 strains into two variant groups, G1 and G2, well defined by four mutations. Initially, SARS CoV-2 was restricted to a \"humid-subtropical\" (Cfa) climate of southeast China, which soon spread all over the world having C climate. Genomic information superimposed on global Koppens climate map elucidates that the gradation \"humid-subtropical\" (Cfa) and \"marine-temperate\" (Cfb) to \"humid-continental\" (Dfa-Dfb) climate drives the evolution of G1 into G2 variant group. It seems an early infection in Europe and USA is due to the dominance of C climate. Russia and North America were infected through linkage of C to D climate and South America from C to A climate. Our study elucidates viruses are sensitive to climate and combined genomic and climatic studies provide crucial information about the pathogenesis and natural spreading pathways during a pandemic which will enable us to take pre-emptive precautionary measures in such outbreaks.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nIn BriefThe authors elucidate adaptation of SARS CoV-2 to different climates by studying phylogenetics and the distribution of strains on Koppens climate map.\n\nHighlightsO_LISARS CoV-2 follows inverse latitudinal gradient.\nC_LIO_LIPhylogenetic network divides SARS CoV-2 strains into two variant groups, G1 and G2.\nC_LIO_LIG1 strains is restricted to Koppens \"temperate\" climate (mainly Cfa-Cfb).\nC_LIO_LIG2 strains has evolved from G1 to sustain in \"humid-continental\" (Dfa-Dfb) and \"tropical-savannah\" (Aw) climate.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Priyanka Bajaj","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Prakash Chandra Arya","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ulises Santiago","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mesfin Nigussie Difabachew","author_inst":"International Clinical Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Kempen","author_inst":"MyungSung Christian Medical Center (MCM) Eye Unit, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Melaku Tesfaye Debele","author_inst":"International Clinical Laboratories, Addis Ababa"},{"author_name":"Abel A Menkir","author_inst":"MyungSung Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Maranatha T Assefa","author_inst":"MyungSung Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Eyob H Asfaw","author_inst":"MyungSung Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Leul B Habtegabriel","author_inst":"MyungSung Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Yohannes Sitotaw Addisie","author_inst":"Ethiopia Biotechnology Institute"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nilles","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Joseph Craig Longenecker","author_inst":"Kuwait University, Health Sciences Center, Faculty of Medicine; Faculty of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amina Benouda","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amine Cheikh","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yahia Cherrah","author_inst":"Cheikh Zaid Hospital"},{"author_name":"Louis Flamand","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Fadila Guessous","author_inst":"Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Eric Boilard","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Mia Phillipson","author_inst":"Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"Division of Affinity Proteomics, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"Division of Protein Technology, Department of Protein Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Department of clinical medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.150482","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 mutations altering regulatory properties: deciphering host's and virus's perspectives","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.150482","rel_abs":"Since the first recorded case of the SARS-CoV-2, it has acquired several mutations in its genome while spreading throughout the globe. However, apart from some changes in protein coding, functional importance of these mutations in disease pathophysiology are still largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the significance of these mutations both from the hosts and viruss perspective by analyzing the host miRNA binding and viruss internal ribosome entry site (IRES), respectively. Strikingly, we observed that due to the acquired mutations, host miRNAs bind differently compared to the reference; where few of the miRNAs lost and few gained the binding affinity for targeting the viral genome. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these gained and lost miRNAs might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Also, we sought to shed some insights on the impacts of mutations on the IRES structure of SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, we detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into the differences observed different parts of the world.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abul B.M.M.K.

The structural elements that govern conformational plasticity of the spike protein are largely unknown. Here, we present a methodology that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central network of H-bonds, has a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding domain, and a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic H-bond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage. From analyses of spike protein sequences we identify patches of histidine and carboxylate groups that could be involved in transient proton binding.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Konstantine Karathanou","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Department of Physics, Theoretical Molecular Biophysics"},{"author_name":"Michalis Lazaratos","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Department of Physics, Theoretical Molecular Biophysics Group"},{"author_name":"Eva Bertalan","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Department of Physics, Theoretical Molecular Biophysics"},{"author_name":"Malte Siemers","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Department of Physics, Theoretical Molecular Biophysics Group"},{"author_name":"Krzysztof Buzar","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Department of Physics, Theoretical Molecular Biophysics Group"},{"author_name":"Gebhard F.X.

Here we report a nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-Nluc) that is genetically stable and replicates similarly to the wild-type virus in cell culture. We demonstrate that the optimized reporter virus assay in Vero E6 cells can be used to measure neutralizing antibody activity in patient sera and produces results in concordance with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Compared with the low-throughput PRNT (3 days), the SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay has substantially shorter turnaround time (5 hours) with a high-throughput testing capacity. Thus, the assay can be readily deployed for large-scale vaccine evaluation and neutralizing antibody testing in humans. Additionally, we developed a high-throughput antiviral assay using SARS-CoV-2-Nluc infection of A549 cells expressing human ACE2 receptor (A549-hACE2). When tested against this reporter virus, remdesivir exhibited substantially more potent activity in A549-hACE2 cells compared to Vero E6 cells (EC50 0.115 vs 1.28 M), while this difference was not observed for chloroquine (EC50 1.32 vs 3.52 M), underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate cells for antiviral testing. Using the optimized SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay, we evaluated a collection of approved and investigational antivirals and other anti-infective drugs. Nelfinavir, rupintrivir, and cobicistat were identified as the most selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2-Nluc (EC50 0.77 to 2.74 M). In contrast, most of the clinically approved antivirals, including tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and velpatasvir were inactive at concentrations up to 10 M. Collectively, this high-throughput platform represents a reliable tool for rapid neutralization testing and antiviral screening for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuping Xie","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Antonio E.

We used detailed phylogenetic analysis, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and in situ molecular dynamics simulations to examine the Spike-RBDs functional evolution, finding that the common ancestral virus with RaTG13, dating to at least 2013, possessed high binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor.

Consequently, much research has gone into the development of pre-clinical assays for the discovery of new or repurposing of FDA-approved therapies. Preventing viral entry into a host cell would be an effective antiviral strategy. One mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs when the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor followed by cleavage at two cut sites (\"priming\") that causes a conformational change allowing for viral and host membrane fusion. TMPRSS2 has an extracellular protease domain capable of cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. A validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease activity would be a valuable tool for studying the impact TMPRSS2 has in viral entry and potentially be an effective antiviral therapeutic. To enable inhibitor discovery and profiling of FDA-approved therapeutics, we describe an assay for the biochemical screening of recombinant TMPRSS2 suitable for high throughput application. We demonstrate effectiveness to quantify inhibition down to subnanomolar concentrations by assessing the inhibition of camostat, nafamostat and gabexate, clinically approved agents in Japan. Also, we profiled a camostat metabolite, FOY-251, and bromhexine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved mucolytic cough suppressant. The rank order potency for the compounds tested are: nafamostat (IC50 = 0.27 nM), camostat (IC50 = 6.2 nM), FOY-251 (IC50 = 33.3 nM) and gabexate (IC50 = 130 nM). Bromhexine hydrochloride showed no inhibition of TMPRSS2. Further profiling of camostat, nafamostat and gabexate against a panel of recombinant proteases provides insight into selectivity and potency.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan H.

To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from [~]0.5 mg\/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg\/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tongqing Zhou","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"I-Ting Teng","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Adam S.

Beyond the lung, COVID-19 impacts diverse tissues including the kidney. ACE2 is a key member of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) which regulates blood pressure, largely through its effects on the kidney. RAAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are widely used therapies for hypertension, cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, and therefore, there is intense interest in their effect on ACE2 expression and its implications for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Here, we analyzed single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq of human kidney to interrogate the association of ACEi\/ARB use with ACE2 expression in specific cell types. First, we performed an integrated analysis aggregating 176,421 cells across 49 donors, 8 studies and 8 centers, and adjusting for sex, age, donor and center effects, to assess the relationship of ACE2 with age and sex at baseline. We observed a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression in tubular epithelial cells of the thin loop of Henle (tLoH) in males relative to females at younger ages, the trend reversing, and losing significance with older ages. ACE2 expression in tLoH increases with age in females, with an opposite, weak effect in males. In an independent cohort, we detected a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression with ACEi\/ARB use in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb, and endothelial cells, but the association was confounded in this small cohort by the underlying disease. Our study illuminates the dynamics of ACE2 expression in specific kidney cells, with implications for SARS-CoV-2 entry and pathogenicity.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayshwarya Subramanian","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Katherine Vernon","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Michal Slyper","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Waldman","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Malte D Luecken","author_inst":"Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen"},{"author_name":"Kirk Gosik","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Dan Dubinsky","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael S Cuoco","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jason Purnell","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Lan Nguyen","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Danielle Dionne","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Orit Rozenblatt-Rosen","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Greka","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Ahmed S.
