Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic and infected millions of people. As the first country proclaimed the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, China implemented travel ban measure, and curbed the epidemic quickly. We performed a phylogenetic analysis to reveal the spread dynamics detail of SARS-CoV-2 in China and the impact of travel ban on SARS-CoV-2. Method. Focusing on SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected from China in public database released as of March 31, 2020, we performed a Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses to estimate the effective population size (Ne) curve of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Furthermore, we displayed the geographic spread mode of SARS-CoV-2 among different China regions by using Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) method. Results. The most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 in China was traced back to December 9, 2019. According the Ne estimation and geographic spread reconstruction, January 25, 2020 was considered as the crucial time point during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China,which was 2 days after the travel ban implemented. On the point, the tendency of viral population size changed from ascending to decreasing, and the cross-regional spread paths were blocked. Conclusions. Travel ban is an effective measure to intervene in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, It is necessary to continue efforts in research for prevention and control measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Guohu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guan Qing","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, The First People's Hospital of Guiyang"},{"author_name":"Mao Qing","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The first hospital affiliated to Army Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20107581","rel_title":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic healthcare workers in greater Houston: a cross-sectional analysis of surveillance data from a large healthcare system","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20107581","rel_abs":"Objective: To determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic COVID-19 facing and non-COVID-19 facing Healthcare Workers (HCWs), with varying job categories across different hospitals. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of a healthcare system surveillance program that included asymptomatic clinical (COVID-19 facing and non-COVID-19 facing), and non-clinical HCWs. A convenience sample of asymptomatic community residents (CR) was also tested. Proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs are reported. Proportional trend across HCW categories was tested using Chi Square trend test. Logistic regression model-based likelihood estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs with varying job functions and across different hospitals are reported as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and CI. Setting: Healthcare system comprising one tertiary care academic medical center and six large community hospitals across Greater Houston and a community sample. Participants: 2,872 self-reported asymptomatic adult (> 18 years) HCWs and CRs. Exposure: Clinical HCWs in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units, non-Clinical HCWs, and CRs. Job categories of Nursing, Providers, Allied Health, Support, and Administration \/ Research. Seven hospitals in the healthcare system. Main Outcomes: Positive reverse transcriptase polymerized chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 Results: Among 2,872 asymptomatic HCWs and CRs, 3.9% (CI: 3.2 - 4.7) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Mean (SD) age was 40.9 (11.7) years and 73% were females. Among COVID-19 facing HCWs 5.4% (CI: 4.5 - 6.5) were positive, whereas 0.6% (CI: 0.2 - 1.7%) of non COVID-19 facing HCWs and none of the non-clinical HCWs or CRs were positive (Ptrend < 0.001). Among COVID-19 facing HCWs, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was similar for all job categories (p = 0.74). However, significant differences in positivity were observed across hospitals. Conclusions and Relevance: Asymptomatic HCWs with COVID-19 patient exposure had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive testing than those not routinely exposed to COVID-19 patients and those not engaged in patient care. Among HCWs with routine COVID-19 exposure, all job types had relatively similar infection rates. These data can inform hospital surveillance and infection control practices for patient-facing job classifications and suggest that general environmental exposure within hospitals is not a significant source of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Farhaan Vahidy","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"H Dirk Sostman","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"},{"author_name":"David Bernard","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"},{"author_name":"Marc L Boom","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"},{"author_name":"Ashley L Drews","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"},{"author_name":"Paul A Christensen","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Finkelstein","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"},{"author_name":"Bita A Kash","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"},{"author_name":"Robert A Phillips","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"},{"author_name":"Roberta L Schwartz","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.20107730","rel_title":"Epidemiological study to detect active SARS-CoV-2 infections and seropositive persons in a selected cohort of employees in the Frankfurt am Main metropolitan area","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.20107730","rel_abs":"So far, 170,000 Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been confirmed in Germany, of which more than 5,000 have been detected in the Frankfurt am Main metropolitan region.

For this purpose we propose a scaling model that can have general applicability in the understanding of real data of epidemics. This is analogous to the finite-size scaling, a technique used in the literature of phase transition to identify universality classes. In the disease model, the size of a system is proportional to the volume of the population, within a geographical region, that have been infected at the death of the epidemic or are eventually going to be infected when an epidemic ends. Outcome of our study, for COVID-19, via application of this model, suggests that in most of the countries, after the `onset' of spread, the growths are described by rapid exponential function, for significantly long periods. In addition to accurately identifying this superuniversal feature, we point out that the model is helpful in grouping countries into universality classes, based on the late time behavior, characterized by physical distancing practices, in a natural way. This feature of the model can provide direct comparative understanding of the effectiveness of lockdown-like social measures adopted in different places.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Subir K.

We aimed to examine the relationship of various prevailing population-based risk factors in comparison with mortality rate and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19. Methods: Demography and epidemiology data which have been identified as verified or postulated risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 were used. The number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths until April 16, 2020 for all affected countries were extracted from Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 websites. Datasets for indicators that are fitting with the factors of COVID-19 mortality were extracted from the World Bank database. Out of about 185 affected countries, only top 50 countries were selected to be analyzed in this study. The following seven variables were included in the analysis, based on data availability and completeness: 1) proportion of people aged 65 above, 2) proportion of male in the population, 3) diabetes prevalence, 4) smoking prevalence, 5) current health expenditure, 6) number of hospital beds and 7) number of nurses and midwives. Quantitative analysis was carried out to determine the correlation between CFR and the aforementioned risk factors. Results: United States shows about 0.20% of confirmed cases in its country and it has about 4.85% of CFR. Luxembourg shows the highest percentage of confirmed cases of 0.55% but a low 2.05% of CFR, showing that a high percentage of confirmed cases does not necessarily lead to high CFR. There is a significant correlation between CFR, people aged 65 and above (p = 0.35) and diabetes prevalence (p = 0.01). However, in our study, there is no significant correlation between CFR of COVID-19, male gender (p = 0.26) and smoking prevalence (p = 0.60). Conclusion: Older people above 65 years old and diabetic patients are significant risk factors for COVID-19. Nevertheless, gender differences and smoking prevalence failed to prove a significant relationship with COVID-19 mortality rate and CFR.

Underlying medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease are based on adult data, but have been applied across all ages resulting in large numbers of families undertaking social shielding (vulnerable group). We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with suspected COVID-19 at a Specialist Childrens Hospital to determine outcomes based on COVID-19 testing status and underlying health vulnerabilities. Methods: Routine clinical data were extracted retrospectively from the Institutions Electronic Health Record system and Digital Research Environment for patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses. Data were compared between Sars-CoV-2 positive and negative patients (CoVPos \/ CoVNeg respectively), and in relation to presence of underlying health vulnerabilities based on Public Health England guidance. Findings: Between 1st March and 15th May 2020, 166 children (<18 years of age) presented to a specialist childrens hospital with clinical features of possible COVID-19 infection. 65 patients (39.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. CoVPos patients were older (median 9 [0.9-14] years vs median 1 [0.1-5.7.5] years respectively, p<0.001). There was a significantly reduced proportion of vulnerable cases (47.7% vs 72.3%, p=0.002), but no difference in proportion of vulnerable patients requiring ventilation (61% vs 64.3%, p = 0.84) between CoVPos and CoVNeg groups. However, a significantly lower proportion of CoVPos patients required mechanical ventilation support compared to CoVNeg patients (27.7 vs 57.4%, p<0.001). Mortality was not significantly different between CoVPos and CoVNeg groups (1.5 vs 4% respectively, p=0.67) although there were no direct COVID-19 related deaths in this highly preselected paediatric population. Interpretation: COVID-19 infection may be associated with severe disease in childhood presenting to a specialist hospital, but does not appear significantly different in severity to other causes of similar clinical presentations. In children presenting with pre-existing COVID-19 vulnerable medical conditions at a specialist centre, there does not appear to be significantly increased risk of either contracting COVID-19 or severe complications, apart from those undergoing chemotherapy, who are over-represented.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Issitt","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"John Booth","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"William Bryant","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Spiridou","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Taylor","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London ad ICS, UCL, London"},{"author_name":"Pascale DuPre","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Padmanabhan Ramnarayan","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"John Hartley","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Mario Cortino Borja","author_inst":"ICH, UCL, London"},{"author_name":"Karyn Moshal","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Helen Dunn","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"IHI, UCL, London"},{"author_name":"Neil Sebire","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital and ICH London, NIHR GOSH BRC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.20107680","rel_title":"Age- and sex-specific total mortality impacts of the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic in England and Wales: Application of a Bayesian model ensemble to mortality statistics","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.20107680","rel_abs":"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic affects mortality directly through infection as well as through changes in the social, environmental and healthcare determinants of health. The impacts on mortality are likely to vary, in both magnitude and timing, by age and sex. Our aim was to estimate the total mortality impacts of the pandemic, by sex, age group and week. Methods: We developed an ensemble of 16 Bayesian models that probabilistically estimate the weekly number of deaths that would be expected had the Covid-19 pandemic not occurred. The models account for seasonality of death rates, medium-long-term trends in death rates, the impact of temperature on death rates, association of death rates in each week on those in preceding week(s), and the impact of bank holidays. We used data from January 2010 through mid-February 2020 (i.e., week starting 15th February 2020) to estimate the parameters of each model, which was then used to predict the number of deaths for subsequent weeks as estimates of death rates if the pandemic had not occurred. We subtracted these estimates from the actual reported number of deaths to measure the total mortality impact of the pandemic. Results: In the week that began on 21st March, the same week that a national lockdown was put in place, there was a >92% probability that there were more deaths in men and women aged [&ge;]45 years than would occur in the absence of the pandemic; the probability was 100% from the subsequent week. Taken over the entire period from mid-February to 8th May 2020, there were an estimated [~] 49,200 (44,700-53,300) or 43% (37-48) more deaths than would be expected had the pandemic not taken place. 22,900 (19,300-26,100) of these deaths were in females (40% (32-48) higher than if there had not been a pandemic), and 26,300 (23,800-28,700) in males (46% (40-52) higher). The largest number of excess deaths occurred among women aged >85 years (12,400; 9,300-15,300), followed by men aged >85 years (9,600; 7,800-11,300) and 75-84 years (9,000; 7,500-10,300). The cause of death assigned to the majority (37,295) of these excess deaths was Covid-19. There was nonetheless a >99.99% probability that there has been an increase in deaths assigned to other causes in those aged [&ge;]45 years. However, by the 8th of May, the all-cause excess mortality had become virtually equal to deaths assigned to Covid-19, and non-Covid excess deaths had diminished to close to zero, or possibly become negative, in all age-sex groups. Interpretation: The death toll of Covid-19 pandemic, in middle and older ages, is substantially larger than the number of deaths reported as a result of confirmed infection, and was visible in vital statistics when the national lockdown was put in place. When all-cause mortality is considered, the mortality impact of the pandemic on men and women is more similar than when comparing deaths assigned to Covid-19 as underlying cause of death.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasilis Kontis","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James E Bennett","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Robbie M Parks","author_inst":"The Earth Institute, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Theo Rashid","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Perviz Asaria","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michel Guillot","author_inst":"Population Studies Center, Department of Sociology, University of Pennsylvania; French Institute for Demographic Studies (INED), Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Marta Blangiardo","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Majid Ezzati","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Karyn Moshal","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Helen Dunn","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"IHI, UCL, London"},{"author_name":"Neil Sebire","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital and ICH London, NIHR GOSH BRC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.20107763","rel_title":"Influence of countries adopted policies for COVID-19 reduction under the view of the airborne transmission framework","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.20107763","rel_abs":"Daily new cases dataset since January 2020 were used to search for evidences of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission as the main nowadays cause of constant infection rates among countries.

This study was aimed at describing clinical characteristics and outcomes of admitted patients with mild COVID-19 illness in the initial phase of pandemic in India. Design - Retrospective (observational ) study. Setting - COVID facilities under AIIMS, New Delhi, where, isolation facilities were designed to manage patients with mild illness and dedicated COVID ICUs was created to cater patients with moderate to severe illness. Participants - Patients aged 18 years or more, with confirmed illness were eligible for enrolment. Patients who were either asymptomatic or mildly ill at presentation were included. Patients with moderate to severe illness at admission, or incomplete clinical symptomatology records were excluded. Methods - Data regarding demographic profile, comorbidities, clinical features, hospital course, treatment, details of results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 done at baseline and at day 14, chest radiographs (wherever available) as well as laboratory parameters was obtained retrospectively from the hospital records. Main outcome measures - Final outcome was noted in terms of course of the disease, patients discharged, still admitted (at time of conclusion of study) or death. Results -Out of 231 cases included, majority were males(78.3%) with a mean age of 39.8 years. Comorbidities were present in 21.2% of patients, diabetes mellitus and hypertension being most common. The most common symptoms were dry cough(81, 35%), fever(64, 27.7%), sore throat(36, 15.6%), and dyspnoea(24, 10.4%); asymptomatic infection was noted in 108(46.8%) patients. Presence of comorbidities was an independent predictor of symptomatic disease (OR-2.66; 95% CI 1.8 to 6.53, p= 0.03). None of the patients progressed to moderate to severe COVID-19.

The possibility of virus transmission from patients with COVID-19 to medical staff is thus of primary concern. Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriage among hospital staff could also be conceivable to act as a potent source of ongoing transmission. Here we show that, surprisingly, none of the medical staff working at a hospital with COVID-19 patients had IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, indicating that virus transmission from patients to medical staff did not occur in these medical workers. These results show that standard preventive measures against infectious diseases can prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure in medical staff, and should greatly encourage medical practitioners at the front line of this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tatsuya Nagano","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jun Arii","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mitsuhiro Nishimura","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Naofumi Yoshida","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Keiji Iida","author_inst":"Hyogo Prefectural Kakogawa Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Nishimura","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yasuko Mori","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Komal Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishkarsh Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Kumar Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Brajesh Ratre","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Balbir Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shweta Bhopale","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pavan Tiwari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ankit Verma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Randeep Guleria","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20107425","rel_title":"A Modelling Analysis of Strategies for Relaxing COVID-19 Social Distancing","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20107425","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: The ability of countries to contain and control COVID-19 virus transmission via social distancing is critical in the absence of a vaccine. Early activation of robust measures has been shown to control the daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. As countries begin to control COVID-19 spread an understanding of how to ease social distancing measures to prevent a rebound in cases and deaths is required. Methods: Using COVID-19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual-based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia. Simulation of virus transmission in this model, with and without, social distancing measures activated permitted us to quantify social distancing effectiveness. Optimal strategies for relaxing social distancing were determined under two settings: with high numbers of daily cases, as in New York; and where early social distancing activation resulted in limited ongoing transmission, as in Perth, Australia. Findings: In countries where strong social distancing measures were activated after the COVID-19 virus had spread widely, our study found these measures are required to be maintained for significant periods before being eased, to return to a situation where daily case numbers become low. In countries where early responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been highly successful, as in Australia, we show that a staged relaxation of social distancing prevents a rebound in cases. Interpretation: Modelling studies and direct observation have shown that robust and timely social distancing have the most effect in containing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures, given they are highly disruptive to society and economic activity. This study demonstrates the necessity of holding robust social distancing in place until COVID-19 virus transmission has significantly decreased, and how they may then be safely eased.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George J Milne","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Simon Xie","author_inst":"the University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Dana Poklepovich","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Naofumi Yoshida","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Keiji Iida","author_inst":"Hyogo Prefectural Kakogawa Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Nishimura","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yasuko Mori","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Komal Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishkarsh Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Kumar Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Brajesh Ratre","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Balbir Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shweta Bhopale","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pavan Tiwari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ankit Verma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Randeep Guleria","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.20107573","rel_title":"Modelling information-dependent social behaviors in response to lockdowns: the case of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.20107573","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic started in January 2020 has not only threatened world public health, but severely impacted almost every facet of lives including behavioral and psychological aspects.

We consider a SEIR-like epidemic model where that contact and quarantine rates are assumed to depend on the available information and rumors about the disease status in the community. The model is applied to the case of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. We consider the period that stretches between February 24, 2020 when the first bulletin by the Italian Civil Protection was reported and May 18, 2020 when the lockdown restrictions have been mostly removed. The role played by the information-related parameters is determined by evaluating how they affect suitable outbreak-severity indicators. We estimated that citizens compliance with mitigation measures played a decisive role in curbing the epidemic curve by preventing a duplication of deaths and about 46% more contagions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bruno Buonomo","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Rossella Della Marca","author_inst":"University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Dana Poklepovich","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Naofumi Yoshida","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Keiji Iida","author_inst":"Hyogo Prefectural Kakogawa Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Nishimura","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yasuko Mori","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Komal Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishkarsh Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Kumar Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Brajesh Ratre","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Balbir Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shweta Bhopale","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pavan Tiwari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ankit Verma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Randeep Guleria","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20107409","rel_title":"A pattern categorization of CT findings to predict outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20107409","rel_abs":"Purpose As global healthcare system is overwhelmed by novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), early identification of risks of adverse outcomes becomes the key to optimize management and improve survival. This study aimed to provide a CT-based pattern categorization to predict outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods 165 patients with COVID-19 (91 men, 4-89 years) underwent chest CT were retrospectively enrolled. CT findings were categorized as Pattern0 (negative), Pattern1 (bronchopneumonia), Pattern2 (organizing pneumonia), Pattern3 (progressive organizing pneumonia) and Pattern4 (diffuse alveolar damage). Clinical findings were compared across different categories. Time-dependent progression of CT patterns and correlations with clinical outcomes, i.e. discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU, requiring mechanical ventilation, or death), with pulmonary sequelae (complete absorption or residuals) on CT after discharge were analyzed. Results Of 94 patients with outcome, 81(86.2%) were discharged, 3(3.2%) were admitted to ICU, 4(4.3%) required mechanical ventilation, 6(6.4%) died. 31(38.3%) had complete absorption at median day 37 after symptom-onset. Significant differences between pattern-categories were found in age, disease-severity, comorbidity and laboratory results (all P<0.05). Remarkable evolution was observed in Pattern0-2 and Pattern3-4 within 3 and 2 weeks after symptom-onset, respectively; most of patterns remained thereafter. After controlling for age, CT pattern significantly correlated with adverse outcomes (Pattern4 vs. Pattern0-3 [reference]; hazard-ratio[95%CI], 18.90[1.91-186.60], P=0.012). CT pattern (Pattern3-4 vs. Pattern0-2 [reference]; 0.26[0.08-0.88], P=0.030) and C-reactive protein (>10 vs. [&le;]10mg\/L [reference]; 0.31[0.13-0.72], P=0.006) were risk-factors associated with pulmonary residuals. Conclusion CT pattern categorization allied with clinical characteristics within 2 weeks after symptom-onset would facilitate early prognostic stratification in COVID-19 pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chao Jin","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Carol C.

Combined with the absence of symptoms and humoral response across that group, this finding suggests that some individuals might be protected by T-cell cross-reactivity. In convalescent patients we observed public and diverse T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, revealing T-cell receptor motifs with germline- encoded features. Bulk CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to Spike glycoprotein were mediated by groups of homologous T-cell receptors, some of them shared across multiple donors.

To this end, we propose a control scheme that aims to develop herd immunity while satisfying the following two basic requirements for a viable policy option. The first requirement is social acceptability: the overall deaths should be minimized for social acceptance. The second is feasibility: the healthcare system should not be overwhelmed to avoid diverse adverse effects. Exploiting the fact that the severity of the disease increases considerably with age, the proposed control scheme protects high-risk individuals that mainly consist of the elderly. The protection of high-risk individuals reduces the average severity of the disease in the unprotected population, thereby substantially reducing mortality and avoiding the collapse of the healthcare system. Social acceptability (in terms of the resulting mortality) and feasibility (in terms of the healthcare system capacity) of the proposed herd immunity strategy are summarized into two respective, easily computable conditions by building on a simple susceptible--infected--recovered (SIR) model. For its parsimony, the proposed framework can provide a rule of thumb that applies to various populations for studying the viability of herd immunity strategies against COVID-19. For Japan, herd immunity may be developed by the considered control scheme if R0 [&le;] 2.0 and the severity rates of the disease are 1\/10 times smaller than the previously reported value, although as high mortality as seasonal influenza is expected.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Takashi Akamatsu","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Nagae","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Minoru Osawa","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Koki Satsukawa","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Takara Sakai","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Daijiro Mizutani","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Iuliia O Peshkova","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Khmelevskaya","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Dmitry V Dianov","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Maria Malasheva","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Anton Shmelev","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Yana Serdyuk","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Dmitry V Bagaev","author_inst":"Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Pivnyuk","author_inst":"Center of Life Sciences, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dmitrii S Shcherbinin","author_inst":"Pirogov Russian Medical State University, Moscow, Russia; Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Alexandra V Maleeva","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Naina T Shakirova","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Artem Pilunov","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Dmitry B Malko","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Ekaterina G Khamaganova","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Bella Biderman","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Alexander V Ivanov","author_inst":"Center for Precision Genome Editing and Genetic Technologies for Biomedicine, Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Ru"},{"author_name":"Mikhail Shugay","author_inst":"Center of Life Sciences, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology; Pirogov Russian Medical State University, Moscow, Russia; Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Insti"},{"author_name":"Grigory A Efimov","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20107482","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and neutralizing activity in donor and patient blood from the San Francisco Bay Area","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20107482","rel_abs":"We report very low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in two San Francisco Bay Area populations.

High quality serology is a key tool to understanding the spread of infection, immunity against the virus, and correlates of protection. Limited validation and testing of serology assays used for serosurveys can lead to unreliable or misleading data, and clinical testing using such unvalidated assays can lead to medically costly diagnostic errors and improperly informed public health decisions. Estimating prevalence and clinical decision making is highly dependent on specificity. Here, we present an optimized ELISA-based serology protocol from antigen production to data analysis. This protocol defines thresholds for IgG and IgM for determination of seropositivity with estimated specificity well above 99%. Validation was performed using both traditionally collected serum and dried blood on mail-in blood sampling kits, using archival (pre-2019) negative controls and known PCR-diagnosed positive patient controls. Minimal cross-reactivity was observed for the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses and no cross reactivity was observed with anti-influenza A H1N1 HAI titer during validation. This strategy is highly specific and is designed to provide good estimates of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in a population, providing specific and reliable data from serosurveys and clinical testing which can be used to better evaluate and understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity and correlates of protection.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carleen Klumpp-Thomas","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Heather Kalish","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Drew","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Sally Hunsberger","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Kelly Snead","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Michael P Fay","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Mehalko","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Anandakumar Shunmugavel","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Wall","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Peter Frank","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"John-Paul Denson","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Min Hong","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Gulcin Gulten","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Simon Messing","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hicks","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Sam Michael","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"William Gilette","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Memoli","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Naomi Akagi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"David N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Neil Neumann","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Daniel Qazi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yale A Santos","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Valerie Green","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Phillip Williamson","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Nancy K Hills","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chuanyi M Lu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

There have been no specific antiviral medications for SARS-CoV-2 while vaccines are still under development. Thus, rapid diagnosis and necessary public health measures are currently key parts to contain the pandemic. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, this method is not suitable for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis because of the timeconsuming procedure, the requirements of biosafety conditions and expensive equipment. In this study, the colorimetric isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAATs) for SARS-CoV-2 based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), cross-priming amplification (CPA), and polymerase spiral reaction (PSR) were developed and compared. The three methods exhibited similar performance with the limit of detection (LOD) as low as just 1 copy per reaction when evaluated on the synthetic DNA fragments. The results can be read with naked eyes within 30 minutes without crossreactivity to closely related coronaviruses. When tested with SARS-CoV-2 extracted genomic-RNA, LAMP outperformed both CPA and PSR assays. Moreover, the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in simulated patient samples (oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs) by colorimetric iNAATs was also successful. Further preparation of the lyophilized reagents for LAMP reactions revealed that the freeze-dried, ready-to-use kit maintained the sensitivity and LOD value of the liquid assays. These results strongly indicate that the colorimetric lyophilized LAMP test kit developed herein is highly suitable for detecting SARS-CoV-2 at POC.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diem Hong Tran","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Quoc Cuong Hoang","author_inst":"Directorial Board, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hau Thi Tran","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Uyen Phuong Le","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hoang Dang Khoa Do","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Minh Bui","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Duc Hai Nguyen","author_inst":"Planning Division, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Thuy Linh Hoang","author_inst":"Medical Analysis Department, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Thi Thanh Thao Nguyen","author_inst":"Microbiology and Immunology Department, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hoang Anh Nguyen","author_inst":"Microbiology and Immunology Department, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Trung Hieu Nguyen","author_inst":"Microbiology and Immunology Department, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Minh Thang Cao","author_inst":"Microbiology and Immunology Department, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Van Van Vu","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Huong Thi Thu Phung","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hicks","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Sam Michael","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"William Gilette","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Memoli","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Naomi Akagi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"David N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Neil Neumann","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Daniel Qazi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yale A Santos","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Valerie Green","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Phillip Williamson","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Nancy K Hills","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chuanyi M Lu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

The PCR-based test, however, shows limited sensitivity, especially at early and late stages of the disease development [2,3], and is relatively time consuming. Fast and reliable complementary methods for detecting the viral infection would be of help in the current pandemia conditions. Mass-spectrometry is one of such possibilities. We have developed a mass-spectrometry based method for the detection of the SARS CoV-2 virus in nasopharynx epithelial swabs, based on the detection of the viral nucleocapsid N protein. The N protein of the SARS-COV-2 virus, the most abundant protein in the virion, is the best candidate for mass-spectrometric detection of the infection, and MS-based detection of several peptides from the SARS-COoV-2 nucleoprotein has been reported earlier by the Sinz group [4]. Our approach shows confident identification of the N protein in patient samples even with the lowest viral loads and a much simpler preparation procedure. Our main protocol consists of virus inactivation by heating and adding of isopropanol, and tryptic digestion of the proteins sedimented from the swabs followed by MS analysis. A set of unique peptides, produced as a result of proteolysis of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, is detected. The obtained results can further be used to create fast parallel mass-spectrometric approaches for the detection of the virus in the nasopharyngeal mucosa, saliva, sputum and other physiological fluids.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Evgeny (Eugene) N Nikolaev","author_inst":"Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Maria I Indeykina","author_inst":"Emanuel Institute for Biochemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Alexander G Brzhozovskiy","author_inst":"Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Anna E Bugrova","author_inst":"Emanuel Institute for Biochemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Alexey Kononikhin","author_inst":"Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Natalia L Starodubtseva","author_inst":"V.

Until the end of February 2020, the number of available genomes was below 1,000, and their multiple alignment was easily achieved using standard approaches. Subsequently, the availability of genomes has grown dramatically. Moreover, some genomes are of low quality with sequencing\/assembly errors, making accurate re-alignment of all genomes nearly impossible on a daily basis. A more efficient, yet accurate approach was clearly required to pursue all subsequent bioinformatics analyses of this crucial data.\n\nResultshCoV-19 genomes are highly conserved, with very few indels and no recombination. This makes the profile HMM approach particularly well suited to align new genomes, add them to an existing alignment and filter problematic ones. Using a core of [~]2,500 high quality genomes, we estimated a profile using HMMER, and implemented this profile in COVID-Align, a user-friendly interface to be used online or as standalone via Docker. The alignment of 1,000 genomes requires less than 20mn on our cluster. Moreover, COVID-Align provides summary statistics, which can be used to determine the sequencing quality and evolutionary novelty of input genomes (e.g. number of new mutations and indels).\n\nAvailabilityhttps:\/\/covalign.pasteur.cloud, hub.docker.com\/r\/evolbioinfo\/covid-align\n\nContactsolivier.gascuel@pasteur.fr, frederic.lemoine@pasteur.fr\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederic Lemoine","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Luc Blassel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jakub Voznica","author_inst":"Insitut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Gascuel","author_inst":"CNRS & Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Alexey Kononikhin","author_inst":"Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Natalia L Starodubtseva","author_inst":"V.

The true risk of a COVID-19 resurgence as states prepare to reopen businesses is unknown. Objective: To quantify the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission in business establishments by building a risk index for each business that measures transmission risk over time. Design: This retrospective case series study uses anonymized cell phone GPS data to analyze trends in traffic patterns to businesses that may be potentially high-risk from January 2020 to June 2020. Setting: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, New York, and California. Participants: 1,272,260 businesses within 8 states from January 2020 - June 2020. Exposure(s): We monitored business traffic before the pandemic, during the pandemic and after early phases of reopening in 8 states. Main Outcome: Our primary outcome is our business risk index. The index was built using two metrics: visitors per square foot and the average duration of visits. Visitors per square foot account for how densely visitors are packed into businesses. The average duration of visits accounts for the length of time visitors are spending in a business. Results: Potentially risky traffic behaviors at businesses decreased by 30% by April. Since the end of April, the risk index has been increasing as states reopen. On average, it has increased between 10 to 20 percentage points since April and is moving towards pre-pandemic levels of traffic. There are some notable differences in trends across states and industries. Conclusion: Our risk index provides a way for policymakers and hospital decision makers to monitor the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission from businesses based on the frequency and density of visits to businesses. Traffic is slowly moving towards pre-pandemic levels. This can serve as an important metric as states monitor and evaluate their reopening strategies.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashley L O'Donoghue","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tenzin Dechen","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Whitney Pavlova","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Boals","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Garba Moussa","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Manvi Madan","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Aalok Thakkar","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Frank J DeFalco","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development"},{"author_name":"Jennifer P Stevens","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gennady T Sukhikh","author_inst":"V.

We estimate the average length of stay from hospitalization data at state level, and calculate the hospitalized rate at both state and county level. Then we develop two medical resource deficiency indices that measure the local medical burden based on the number of accumulated active confirmed cases normalized by local maximum potential medical resources, and the number of hospitalized patients that can be supported per ICU beds per critical care staff, respectively. The medical resources data, and the two medical resource deficiency indices are illustrated in a dynamic spatiotemporal visualization platform based on ArcGIS Pro Dashboards.

Knowledge of this virus is evolving, definitive care is not yet known, and mortality is increasing. We assessed its initial impact on paediatric surgical practice in Nigeria, creating a benchmark for recommendations and future reference. Methods Survey of 120 paediatric surgeons from 50 centres to assess socio-demographics and specific domains of impact of COVID-19 on their services and training in Nigeria. Seventy four surgeons adequately responded. Responses have been analysed. Duplicate submissions for centres were excluded by combining and averaging the responses from centres with multiple respondents. Results Forty-six (92%) centres had suspended elective surgeries. All centres continued emergency surgeries but volume reduced in March by 31%. Eleven (22%) centres reported 13 suspended elective cases presenting as emergencies in March, accounting for 3% of total emergency surgeries. Nine (18%) centres adopted new modalities for managing selected surgical conditions: non-operative reduction of intussusception in 1(2%), antibiotic management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in 5(10%), more conservative management of trauma and replacement of laparoscopic appendectomy with open surgery in 3(6%) respectively. Low perception of adequacy of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) was reported in 35(70%) centres. Forty (80%) centres did not offer telemedicine for patients follow up. Twenty-nine (58%) centres had suspended academic training. Perception of safety to operate was low in 37(50%) respondents, indifferent in 24% and high in 26%. Conclusion Majority of paediatric surgical centres reported cessation of elective surgeries whilst continuing emergencies. There is however an acute decline in the volume of emergency surgeries. Adequate PPE need to be provided and preparations towards handling backlog of elective surgeries once the pandemic recedes. Further study is planned to more conclusively understand the full impact of this pandemic on children's surgery. Key words pandemic, COVID-19, children's surgery.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ibukunolu O Ogundele","author_inst":"OOUTH, SAGAMU"},{"author_name":"Felix M Alakaloko","author_inst":"LUTH, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Collins C Nwokoro","author_inst":"OOUTH, Sagamu"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel A Ameh","author_inst":"NHA, Abuja FCT"},{"author_name":"Shiyang Ruan","author_inst":"Department of Geography and GeoInformation Science, George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Tian","author_inst":"NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center, George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Yuyang Tian","author_inst":"Mercy Clinic Family Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chaowei Yang","author_inst":"NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center, George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer P Stevens","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gennady T Sukhikh","author_inst":"V.

To address these issues, we introduce a Bayesian approach to the SIR model with correction for under-reporting in the analysis of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. The proposed model was enforced to obtain estimates of important quantities such as the reproductive rate and the average infection period, along with the more likely date when the pandemic peak may occur.

The disease transmits mainly through respiratory droplets and aerosol. Although models for the evaporation and trajectory of respiratory droplets have been developed, how the environment impacts the transmission of COVID-19 is still unclear. In this study, we investigate the propagation of respiratory droplets and aerosol particles generated by speech under a wide range of temperature (0 degree Celsius to 40 degree Celsius) and relative humidity (0% to 92%) conditions. We show that droplets can travel three times farther in low temperature and high humidity environment, while the amount of aerosol increases in high temperature and low humidity environment. The results also underscore the importance of proper ventilation, as droplets and aerosol spread significantly farther in airstreams. This study contributes to the understanding of the environmental impact on COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Zhao","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Yuhang Qi","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Paolo Luzzatto-Fegiz","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Yi Cui","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yangying Zhu","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Cor Jesus Fernandes Fontes","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso"},{"author_name":"Yuyang Tian","author_inst":"Mercy Clinic Family Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chaowei Yang","author_inst":"NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center, George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer P Stevens","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gennady T Sukhikh","author_inst":"V.

The current gold standard method of testing for COVID-19 is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The RT-PCR test, however, has an imperfect sensitivity (around 70%), is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and is in short supply, particularly in resource-limited countries. Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities such as chest X-ray and Computed Tomography, which are more widely available and accessible, can be beneficial as an alternative diagnostic tool. We develop a novel hierarchical attention neural network model to classify chest radiography images as belonging to a person with either COVID-19, other infections, or no pneumonia (i.e., normal). We refer to this model as Artificial Intelligence for Detection of COVID-19 (AIDCOV). The hierarchical structure in AIDCOV captures the dependency of features and improves model performance while the attention mechanism makes the model interpretable and transparent. Using a publicly available dataset of 5801 chest images, we demonstrate that our model achieves a mean cross-validation accuracy of 97.8%. AIDCOV has a sensitivity of 99.3%, a specificity of 99.98%, and a positive predictive value of 99.6% in detecting COVID-19 from chest radiography images. AIDCOV can be used in conjunction with or instead of RT-PCR testing (where RT-PCR testing is unavailable) to detect and isolate individuals with COVID-19 and prevent onward transmission to the general population and healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maryam Zokaeinikoo","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Pooyan Kazemian","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Prasenjit Mitra","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Soundar Kumara","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Yangying Zhu","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Cor Jesus Fernandes Fontes","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso"},{"author_name":"Yuyang Tian","author_inst":"Mercy Clinic Family Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chaowei Yang","author_inst":"NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center, George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer P Stevens","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gennady T Sukhikh","author_inst":"V.
