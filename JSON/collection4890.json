The study region is in an urban and well-defined environment in a low-incidence region in Northern Germany. We found that approx. 70 % of the patients developed sustainable antibodies 3 weeks or later after the infection. In about 30 % of the patients with mild to moderate symptoms, no significant antibodies could be detected in two consecutive analyses. Conversely, out of ten patients without symptoms, four were repeatedly positive. Expectedly, six had no specific antibodies. The data indicate that antibody-positivity is a useful indicator of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Negative antibodies do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future studies need to determine the functionality of the antibodies in terms of personal protection and ability to transmit the virus.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Werner Solbach","author_inst":"University of Luebeck, Center for Infection and Inflammation Research, Luebeck, Germany; Health Protection Authority, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Julia Schiffner","author_inst":"Health Protection Authority, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Insa Backhaus","author_inst":"Health Protection Authority, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany; Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"David Burger","author_inst":"Municipal Statistics Department, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ralf Staiger","author_inst":"Gemeinschaftspraxis Huextertor, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bettina Tiemer","author_inst":"Laboraerztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bobrowski","author_inst":"Laboraerztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Timothy Hutchings","author_inst":"Municipal Statistics Department, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Mischnik","author_inst":"Health Protection Authority, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20110767","rel_title":"The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic healthcare workers with intensive exposure to COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20110767","rel_abs":"The prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers with intensive exposure to COVID-19 is unclear.

This study presents a novel approach for quantitative assessment of the individual infection risk of susceptible subjects exposed in indoor microenvironments in the presence of an asymptomatic infected SARS-CoV-2 subject. The approach allowed the maximum risk for an exposed healthy subject to be evaluated or, starting from an acceptable risk, the maximum exposure time. We applied the proposed approach to four distinct scenarios for a prospective assessment, highlighting that, in order to guarantee an acceptable individual risk of 10-3 for exposed subjects in naturally ventilated indoor environments, the exposure time should be shorter than 20 min. The proposed approach was used for retrospective assessment of documented outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou (China) and at a choir rehearsal in Mount Vernon (USA), showing that, in both cases, the high attack rate values can be justified only assuming the airborne transmission as the main route of contagion. Moreover, we shown that such outbreaks are not caused by the rare presence of a superspreader, but can be likely explained by the co-existence of conditions, including emission and exposure parameters, leading to a highly probable event, which can be defined as a superspreading event.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giorgio Buonanno","author_inst":"University of Cassino and Southern Lazio"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Luca Stabile","author_inst":"University of Cassino and Southern Lazio"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, HUST"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST"},{"author_name":"Bettina Tiemer","author_inst":"Laboraerztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bobrowski","author_inst":"Laboraerztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Timothy Hutchings","author_inst":"Municipal Statistics Department, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Mischnik","author_inst":"Health Protection Authority, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20119057","rel_title":"Potential impact of Covid-19 response measures on invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20119057","rel_abs":"In January 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) removed one of the two infant doses of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), leaving a single priming dose at 3 months and a 12 month booster. We modelled the potential impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) of a drop in PCV13 coverage associated with the restrictions on non-essential health care visits introduced to combat COVID-19 in the UK on 23 March 2020. Using a previously published model of pneumococcal transmission in England and Wales we simulated the impact of reducing PCV13 coverage by 50% for 3 months from 23 March without subsequent catch-up vaccination. To implement social distancing, we reduced mixing between and within age-groups by either 10% or 50%. In a sensitivity analysis we explored the effect of complete cessation of PCV13 vaccination during the lockdown and of extending its duration to 6 months. Annual numbers of IPD cases predicted by the model under different vaccination and lockdown scenarios with uncertainty intervals (UI) generated from the minimum and maximum values of the model predictions using 500 parameter sets with values within a pre-specified range of the maximum likelihood set. The model predicted that any increase in IPD cases from a reduction in PCV13 coverage would be more than offset by a reduction in pneumococcal transmission due to social distancing, with a net reduction in cumulative IPD cases (UI -1,479, -1,061, all ages) over the next five years. Similar results were obtained in the sensitivity analysis, though with a greater reduction with a 6 month lockdown. COVID-19 social distancing measures are predicted to have had a profound effect on pneumococcal transmission resulting in a reduction in pneumococcal carriage prevalence and IPD incidence over the first two years after the lockdown. Carriage studies will be informative in confirming the predicted impact of the social distancing measures after they have been lifted.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yoon Hong Choi","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Miller","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luca Stabile","author_inst":"University of Cassino and Southern Lazio"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, HUST"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST"},{"author_name":"Bettina Tiemer","author_inst":"Laboraerztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bobrowski","author_inst":"Laboraerztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Timothy Hutchings","author_inst":"Municipal Statistics Department, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Mischnik","author_inst":"Health Protection Authority, City of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20108597","rel_title":"POOLING FOR SARS-CoV-2 CONTROL IN CARE INSTITUTIONS","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20108597","rel_abs":"Workers and residents in Care Homes are considered at special risk for the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to the infectivity and high mortality rate in the case of residents, compared to other containment areas. The aims of the present study, based in our local experience, were (a) to describe SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in institutionalized people in Galicia (Spain) during the Coronavirus pandemic and (b) to evaluate the expected performance of a pooling strategy using RT-PCR for the next rounds of screening of institutionalized people. Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection at Care Houses was uneven. As the virus circulation global rate was low in our area, the number of people at risk of acquiring the infection continues to be very high. In this work, we have successfully demonstrated that pooling of different groups of samples at low prevalence clusters, can be done with a small average delay on quantification cycle (Cq) values. A new surveillance system with guaranteed protection is required for small clusters, previously covered with individual testing. Our proposal for Care Houses, once prevalence zero is achieved, would include successive rounds of testing using a pooling solution for transmission control preserving testing resources. Scale-up of this method may be of utility to confront larger clusters to avoid the viral circulation and keeping them operative.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge J Cabrera","author_inst":"Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Vigo (CHUVI), Sergas.

Yet, secondary bacterial infection is uncommon. However, as epithelium are injured and barrier function is lost, bacterial products entering the circulation might contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Methods: We studied 19 adults, severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection, who were admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 13th March and 17th April 2020. Blood samples on day 1, 3, and 7 of enrollment were analyzed for endotoxin activity assay (EAA), Beta-D-Glucan (BG), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the circulating bacteriome. Findings: Of the 19 patients, 14 were in intensive care and 10 patients received mechanical ventilation. We found 8 patients with high EAA ([&ge;] 0.6) and about half of the patients had high serum BG levels which tended to be higher in later in the illness. Although only 1 patient had a positive blood culture, 18 of 19 patients were positive for 16S rRNA gene amplification. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The diversity of bacterial genera was decreased overtime. Interpretation: Bacterial DNA and toxins were discovered in virtual all severely ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients. This raises a previously unrecognized concern for significant contribution of bacterial products in the pathogenesis of this disease.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Phatadon

This analysis aimed to determine a 48 hours prediction of moderate to severe respiratory failure, as assessed with PaO2\/FiO2 < 150 mmHg, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods This was an observational study that comprised all consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the University Hospital of Modena, Italy from 21 February to 6 April 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed with PCR positive nasopharyngeal swabs while the presence of pneumonia was radiologically confirmed. Patients received standard of care according to national guidelines for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients' full medical history, demographic and epidemiological features, clinical data, complete blood count, coagulation, inflammatory and biochemical markers were routinely collected and aggregated in a clinically-oriented logical framework in order to build different datasets. The dataset was used to train a learning framework relying on Microsoft LightGBM and leveraging a hybrid approach, where clinical expertise is applied alongside a data-driven analysis. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to quantify the positive or negative impact of each variable included in the model on the predicted outcome. The study outcome was the onset of moderate to severe respiratory failure defined as PaO2\/FiO2 ratio < 150 mmHg ([&ge;] 13.3 kPa) in at least one of two consecutive arterial blood gas analyses in the following 48 hours. Results A total of 198 patients contributed to generate 1068 valuable observations which allowed to build 3 prediction models based respectively on 31-variables signs and symptoms, 39-variables laboratory biomarkers and 91-variables as a composition of the two. A fourth boosted mixed model which included 20 variables was selected from the model 3, achieved the best predictive performance (AUC=0.84). Its clinical performance was applied in a narrative case report as an example. Conclusion This study developed a machine learning algorithm, with a 84% prediction accuracy, which is potentially able to assist clinicians in decision making process with therapeutic implications.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davide Ferrari","author_inst":"Department of Physical, Computer and Mathematical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia,

Moving averages and the Epidemic Evaluation Indices (EEI) are two important but complementary methods useful in monitoring epidemic trends, they can also serve as a useful guide for policy makers and inform the timing of decisions on preventive measures. The objectives of this paper are to graphically depict the trends of new COVID-19 cases nationally and in two key States (Lagos and Kano) and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) using the moving averages and the EEI. In addition, we examined the effects of governments public health interventions on the spread of COVID-19 and appraise the progress made so far in addressing the challenges of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Methods: We used data on new cases of COVID-19 from public sources released by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) from the 27th February 2020, when the first case was recorded, to 11th May, 2020, one week after the lockdowns in Lagos and the FCT were lifted. We computed moving averages of various orders, the log transformations of the moving averages and then the EEIs of new COVID-19 cases for Nigeria as a whole, and then for two of the most affected states i.e. Lagos and Kano, as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Then, we plotted graphs to depict these indices and show the epidemic trends for COVID-19 in each scenario. Results: Nationally, the number of new cases of COVID-19 showed an initial gradual rise from the first reported case on the 27th February 2020. However, by the second week in April, these numbers began to show a relatively sharper increase and this trend has continued till date. Similar trends were observed in Lagos state and the FCT. The rate of growth of the logarithm-transformed moving average in the period leading to, and including the lockdowns reduced by a factor of 0.65. This suggests that the policies put in place by the government including the lockdown measures in Lagos and the FCT may have had a positive effect on the development of new cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Nationally and in Lagos, the EEIs of the COVID-19 cases started off on very high notes, however, the effects of the lockdown gradually became evident by the end of April and early May 2020, as the EEIs headed closer to 1.0. In all case scenarios, the EEIs are still above 1.0. Conclusions and recommendations: The number of new cases of COVID-19 has been on a steady rise since the first reported case. In Nigeria especially across the two states and the FCT, public health interventions including the lockdown measures appear to have played a role in reducing the rate of increase of new infections. The EEIs are still above 1.0, suggesting that despite the progress that appears to have been made, the epidemic is still evolving and Nigeria has not yet reached her peak for COVID-19 cases. We recommend that aggressive public health interventions and restrictions against mass gatherings should be sustained.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oluwakemi Ololade

mental health outcomes associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, including trauma-related symptoms although the effects on the Italian population who were subjected to unprecedented nationwide lockdown measure remains unknown. The Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS) is a brief instrument designed to assess a broad range of trauma-related symptoms with no available validation in the Italian population. Aims: This study aimed at examining the factor structure of the Italian version of the GPS in a general population sample exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic and at evaluating trauma-related symptoms in the Italian population in the context of specific COVID-19 related risk factors associated with the implementation of lockdown measures and social distancing. Methods: Cross-sectional web-based observational study, as part of a long-term monitoring programme of mental health outcomes in the general population. 18147 participants completed a self-report online questionnaire to collect key demographic data and to evaluate trauma-related symptoms using the GPS, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and PSS. Validation analyses included both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and correlation analyses. Results: Exploratory factor analyses supported both a two-factor and a three-factor model. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a one-factor solution that was used as a baseline comparison showed acceptable fit indices, the two-factor solution showed good fit indices, but the best fitting model was a three-factor solution, with Negative Affect (symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, irritability), core Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) (avoidance, re-experiencing, hyperarousal and insomnia) and Dissociative symptoms. GPS Risk factors as well as specific COVID-19 related stressful events, were associated with GPS total as well as the three factor scores. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a wide range of trauma-spectrum symptoms were reported by a large Italian sample during the COVID-19 pandemic. The GPS symptoms clustered best in three factors: Negative Affect symptoms, Core PTSS, and Dissociative symptoms. In particular high rates of core PTSS and negative affect symptoms were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and should be routinely assessed in clinical practice.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rodolfo Rossi","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Valentina Socci","author_inst":"University of

Multivariate logistic regression models including age, sex, and ethnicity were used to test whether addition of: 1)cardiometabolic factors (diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, prior myocardial infarction, smoking, BMI); 2)25(OH)-vitamin D; 3)poor diet; 4)Townsend deprivation score; 5)housing (home type, overcrowding); or 6)behavioural factors (sociability, risk taking) attenuated sex\/ethnicity associations with COVID-19 status. Results There was over-representation of men and non-White ethnicities in the COVID-19 positive group. Non-Whites had, on average, poorer cardiometabolic profile, lower 25(OH)-vitamin D, greater material deprivation, and were more likely to live in larger households and flats\/apartments. Male sex, non-White ethnicity, higher BMI, Townsend deprivation score, and household overcrowding were independently associated with significantly greater odds of COVID-19. The pattern of association was consistent for men and women; cardiometabolic, socio-demographic and behavioural factors did not attenuate sex\/ethnicity associations. Conclusions Sex and ethnicity differential pattern of COVID-19 is not adequately explained by variations in cardiometabolic factors, 25(OH)-vitamin D levels, or socio-economic factors. Investigation of alternative biological pathways and different genetic susceptibilities is warranted.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zahra Raisi-Estabragh","author_inst":"William

SARS-CoV-2 virus was originated in the city of Wuhan (China) in December 2019, the virus began to spread in other regions of China until it spread to the rest of the world. In this research, an analysis was made of environmental factors (tropospheric column of NO2, vertical airflow, percentage of solid waste disposed of in open dumps and percentage of the population without any mechanism of faeces disposal) and social factors (levels of monetary poverty, percentage of the number of hospitals per population and vulnerable population) that could directly and indirectly affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the regions of Peru. Remote sensing techniques, geographic information systems and an analysis under the multi-parametric statistical approach proposed by Saaty were used to determine which regions present greater susceptibility, vulnerability and risk of spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results show that the prevalence of high values of tropospheric NO2 and values close to 0 Pa\/s of the vertical airflow were directly related to the number of positive cases by COVID-19. In addition, it was found that 68% of the regions of Peru are at a \"high\" and \"very high\" risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus, and most of them are in northern and central Peru (Callao, Tumbes, Piura, Loreto, Lambayeque, Huancavelica, Amazonas, Cajamarca, Ucayali, Huanuco and among others), therefore, special care should be taken with the measures adopted after social isolation in order to avoid the resurgence and collapse of the of health systems. It concludes that public policies on air quality management, integrated solid waste management and sanitation services should be improved in order to reduce the risk of spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Biomarkers cannot robustly identify such patients pre-emptively and no specific interventions exist to mitigate clinical deterioration. Mononuclear phagocytic cells are key immune cells and bind fibrinogen through the CD11b\/CD18 dimer CR3, whose activated form can initiate microthrombus formation.

March 31st, 2020, during the height of the pandemic, we have decontaminated thousands of 3M 1860 respirators with Ultraviolet C (UVC) for our frontline workers. There is no published peer-reviewed data regarding the dose required to effectively disinfect SARS-CoV-2 on N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Four different locations (facepiece and strap) on 5 different N95 FFR models (3M 1860, 8210, 8511, 9211; Moldex 1511) were inoculated with a 10 L drop of SARS-CoV-2 viral stock (8 x 107 TCID50\/mL). The outside-facing and wearer-facing surfaces of the respirators were each irradiated with a dose of 1.5 J\/cm2 UVC (254 nm). Viable SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by a median tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID50). UVC delivered using a dose of 1.5 J\/cm2, to each side, was an effective method of decontamination for the facepieces of 3M 1860 and Moldex 1511, and for the straps of 3M 8210 and the Moldex 1511. This dose is an appropriate decontamination method to facilitate reuse of respirators for healthcare personnel when applied to certain models\/materials. Increasing the dose may improve decontamination for the other models and straps; however, UVC radiation can degrade certain polymers in a dose dependent manner, and the effects may vary greatly between different models. Therefore, fit-testing of UVC decontaminated respirators must be performed each time a new model and\/or dose is introduced into the healthcare system.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David M.

By means of a simple epidemic model, allowing for both short and long-term visitors to the province, it is studied which features are most influential in determining if such summer movements will result in large number of infections among the province population. The method is applied to the island of Gotland off the South East coast of Sweden. It is shown that the amount of mixing between the metropolitan and province groups and the fraction of metropolitan people being infectious upon arrival are most influential. Consequently, minimizing events gathering both the province and metropolitan groups and\/or reducing the number of short-term visitors could substantially decrease spreading, as could measures to lower the fraction initially infectious upon arrival.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Britton","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Frank G Ball","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Shanthi Narla","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Carla D.

evolution of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence in the greater area of Zurich, Switzerland, a region that has been only mildly hit by the pandemic in spite of hosting an international airport hub and a highly mobile population. Seroprevalence studies in low-prevalence settings require large sample sizes and high-specificity methodologies. To address this particular challenge, we developed a Tripartite Automated Blood Immunoassay to assess the IgG response against three SARS-CoV-2 proteins on approximately 40'000 samples from university hospital patients and healthy blood donors. The seroprevalence increased in March 2020 (0.3%; CI95%: 0.1% - 0.5%) in the cohort of the hospital patients but rapidly plateaued in April at 1.1-1.3%, with a slight drop in June, then decreased in July to 0.3-0.7%. Seropositive samples were confirmed with Western Blotting and liquid-phase binding assays. Employing a dynamic transmission model that describes SARS-CoV-2 transmission and seroconversion in the general population of the Canton of Zurich, we estimated an infection fatality ratio of 0.6% (CI95%: 0.4%-0.8%). We conclude that a small proportion of the population in the greater area of Zurich has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, with an IFR that is similar to that of other European areas. The evolution of seroprevalence points to a high effectiveness of containment measures and\/or to rapid loss of humoral responses.","rel_num_authors":58,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc Emmenegger","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Elena De Cecco","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"David Lamparter","author_inst":"Health2030 Genome Center. 9 Chemin des Mines, 1202 Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Raphael P.

Once these countries passed the peak, the daily case count fell back, mirroring its initial climb in a symmetric way, just as the classic model predicts. However, in Italy and Spain, and now the UK and many other Western countries, the experience has been very different. The daily count has fallen back gradually from the peak but remained stubbornly high. The reason for the divergence from the classical model remain unclear. We take an empirical stance on this issue and develop a model that is based upon the statistical characteristics of the time series. With the possible exception of China, the workhorse logistic model is decisively rejected against more flexible alternatives.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter D.

Materials and Methods This is a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing CTPA between 23rd March 2020 and 19th April 2020 in a tertiary centre. The presence of PTD, location and involved pulmonary lobes were documented. The pattern and extent of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities including the presence of fibrosis, lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion were evaluated by two experienced observers independently and consensus was achieved for the most disparate results. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using Kappa statistics. Student t-test, Chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare imaging features between PTD and non-PTD sub-groups. Results During the study period, 2157 patients were confirmed with COVID-19, 297\/2157 (13.8%) had CT imaging, 100\/2157 (4.6%) were CTPA studies, 93 studies were analysed, excluding sub-optimal studies. Overall incidence of PTD was 41\/93 (44%) with a third of patients showing segmental and subsegmental PTD (n=28\/93, 30%,). D-dimer was elevated in 90\/93 (96.8%) of cases. High Wells score did not differentiate between PE and non-PE groups (p=0.801). The inter-observer agreement was fair (Kappa=0.659) for parenchymal pattern and excellent (Kappa = 0.816) for severity. Lymph node enlargement was found in 34\/93 of cases (36.6%) with 29\/34 (85.3%) showing no additional source of infection. Fibrosis was seen in 16\/93 (17.2%) of cases, mainly demonstrating fibrotic organising pneumonia. Conclusion There is a high incidence of PTD in COVID -19 patients undergoing CTPA, complicated by lack of a valid risk stratification tool. Our data indicates a much higher suspicion of PTD is needed in severe COVID-19 patients. The concomitant presence of fibrotic features on CT indicates the need for follow-up for evaluation of chronic pulmonary complications.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cheng Fang","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Garzillo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bhavna Batohi","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Marko Berovic","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul Sidhu","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hasti Robbie","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Dezirae Schneider","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Berre Dogancay","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Guo","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Anne Wiedmer","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Julie Domange","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Marigona Imeri","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rita Moos","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Chryssa Zografou","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Chiara Trevisan","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Andres Gonzalez-Guerra","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Carrella","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Irina L.

Design: Online cross-sectional survey. Setting: Data were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020. Participants: 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. Participants were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. Main outcome measures: Having gone out in the last 24 hours in those who reported symptoms of COVID-19 in their household. Having gone out shopping for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines (non-essentials), and total number of outings, in the last week in those who reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in their household. Results: 217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature \/ fever) in the last seven days. Of these people, 75.1% had left the home in the last 24 hours (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence were being male, less worried about COVID-19, and perceiving a smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for non-essentials in the last week (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of Government \"lockdown\" measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19, and decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules. Having received help was associated with better adherence. Conclusions: Adherence to self-isolation is poor. As we move into a new phase of contact tracing and self-isolation, it is essential that adherence is improved. Communications should aim to increase knowledge about actions to take when symptomatic or if you have been in contact with a possible COVID-19 case. They should also emphasise the risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 when out and about and the effectiveness of preventative measures. Using volunteer networks effectively to support people in isolation may promote adherence.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise E.

However, overestimating these parameters may put the public and policymakers in a muddle. In this paper, an optimistic scenario is simulated, wherein the dynamics of the COVID-19 curve is allowed to spread to such an extent that the projections of the COVID-19 parameters do not take excessively high values. Based on this scenario, the ending life-cycle and cumulative cases for India and some of its states, are predicted. Our study, suggests that the fall of the peak amplitude (95%) of the major COVID-19 wave in India may take place by the 8th of September 2020 with a total count of 655000 cases. Simulation results, also indicate that Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan may end up with 263700, 18140, 50600, 21130, 24420, 44170, 27080, and 28200 cumulative cases respectively.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dr. Praveen Gupta","author_inst":"Government Polytechnic College, Jaipur, India"},{"author_name":"Prof. K.K.

A major risk factor for adverse outcome in COVID-19 infection is the presence of advance age, co-morbidities including diabetes, hypertension and obesity among other non-communicable diseases2. Epidemiological data from high-prevalence countries reveal that compared to men, women are less likely to die or to require hospital admission to intensive care. This may suggest that pregnant women are not more susceptible to infection or to experience serious complications. However, whether the presence of co-morbidities or advanced maternal age confers a higher risk of adverse outcome in pregnant women with COVID-19 is unknown3. In this research letter, we aimed at evaluating the risk factor associated with maternal mortality secondary to COVID-19 infection in a middle-income country. Advanced maternal age is linked to an increased risk of mortality, while diabetes is the most important risk factor for maternal death. This is partly explained by an increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases in women of advanced age which is a common feature in most countries4. In the last decades, low- and middle-income countries have experienced accelerated socio-cultural changes associated with its incorporation into the international economic community, which have increased the number of obese and diabetic population, including pregnant women5. This has caused an increased risk for complications and fatality among COVID-19 positive population2,3. Thus, policies for reducing obesity and diabetes in low- and middle-income countries are most needed to reduce the mortality of COVID-19 in pregnant women.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raigam Jafet Martinez-Portilla","author_inst":"University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alexadros Sotiriadis","author_inst":"Second Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"},{"author_name":"Johnatan Torres-Torres","author_inst":"Hospital General de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Charzakis Christos","author_inst":"Second Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"},{"author_name":"Ameth Hawkins-Villarreal","author_inst":"University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Rafael Villafan-Bernal","author_inst":"Catedras CONACYT, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica"},{"author_name":"Rodolfo A Gurrola-Ochoa","author_inst":"Iberoamerican Research Network"},{"author_name":"Francesc Figueras","author_inst":"University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Berre Dogancay","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Guo","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Anne Wiedmer","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Julie Domange","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Marigona Imeri","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rita Moos","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Chryssa Zografou","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Chiara Trevisan","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Andres Gonzalez-Guerra","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Carrella","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Irina L.

Individuals with rare disorders, like Down syndrome (DS) are historically understudied. Currently, it is not known how COVID-19 pandemic affects individuals with DS. Herein, we report an analysis of individuals with DS who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, USA. Methods. In this retrospective, single-center study of 4,615 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we analyzed all patients with DS admitted in the Mount Sinai Health System. Hospitalization rates, clinical and outcomes were assessed. Findings. Contrary to an expected number of one, we identified six patients with DS. We found that patients with DS are at an 8.9-fold higher risk of hospitalization with COVID-19 when compared to non-DS patients. Hospitalized DS individuals are on average 10 years younger than non-DS patients with COVID-19. Moreover, type 2 diabetes mellitus appears to be an important driver of this susceptibility to COVID-19. Finally, patients with DS have more severe outcomes than controls, and are more likely to progress to sepsis in particular. Interpretation. We demonstrate that individuals with DS represent a higher risk population for COVID-19 compared to the general population and conclude that particular care should be taken for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in these patients.

Inflammation is central to the aetiology of both conditions where variations in immune responses have the potential to mitigate or aggravate disease course. Identifying at risk groups based on immuno-inflammatory signatures is valuable in directing personalised care and developing potential targets for precision therapy. Methods: This study characterised immunophenotypic variation associated with COVID-19 severity in type 2 diabetes. Broad-spectrum immunophenotyping quantified 15 leukocyte populations in peripheral circulation from a cohort of 45 hospitalised COVID-19 patients with and without type 2 diabetes. Results: Morphological anomalies in the monocyte pool, monocytopenia specific to quiescent monocytes, and a decreased frequency of cytotoxic lymphocytes were associated with severe COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes requiring intensive care. An aggravated inflammatory gene expression profile, reminiscent of the type-1 interferon pathway, underlaid the immunophenotype associated with severe disease in T2D. Conclusion: Shifts in T-cell and monocyte dynamics underpin a maladaptive response to SARS-CoV-2. These alterations may impact type-1 interferon signalling which is the likely source of the hyperinflammation that increases voracity of COVID-19. These findings allow the identification of type 2 diabetic patients at risk of severe disease as well as providing evidence that the type-1 interferon pathway may be an actionable therapeutic target for future studies.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fawaz ALZAID","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite, Cordeliers Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Jean-Baptiste Julla","author_inst":"INSERM CRC \/ Hopital Lariboisiere - APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Diedisheim","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC \/ Hopital Cochin"},{"author_name":"Charline Potier","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Louis Potier","author_inst":"Hopital Bichat - APHP"},{"author_name":"Gilberto Velho","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Benedicte Gaborit","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University, INSERM, INRA, C2VN, Marseille, France.

However, hand washing must be perpetuated properly using soap and water for at least 20 seconds. In response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, various hospitals have imposed mandatory hand washing to everyone prior entering the facilities, and when leaving. This study aimed to assess the hand washing compliance among visitors of a university referral hospital. Methods: A non-participatory observational study was conducted in the main entrance of the hospital from April 27 to May 3, 2020, to measure hand washing compliance of its visitors. The quality of hand washing was assessed via direct observation for compliance with the recommended World Health Organization (WHO) core steps. Data were collected using Open Data Kit (ODK) mobile application. Results: A total of 1,282 hospital visitors were observed, of which 874(68.2%) were males. Full hand washing compliances were observed among 0.9% (95% CI: 0.4-1.4) of the visitors. Withal, there was no difference in the compliances between genders (0.9% vs 0.7%, P = 0.745). Conclusion: Despite the fact that proper hand washing with soap and water is proven to be one of the effective ways in preventing the spread of COVID-19, a significant number of hospital visitors did not practice standard hand washing procedures. Improvements in this measure are urgently needed in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Biniyam Sahiledengle","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Yohannes Tekalegn","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Abulie Takele","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Demisu Zenbab","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Zinash Teferu","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Alelign Tasew","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Tesfaye Assefa","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Nursing, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Kebebe Bekele","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Surgery, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Abdi Abdi","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Surgery, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Habtamu Gezahegn","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Physiology, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Tadesse Awoke","author_inst":"University of Gondar, Colleague of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Gondar, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Bruce John Edward Quisido","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Nursing, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Elise Dalmas","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Venteclef","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes, Clinical Investigation Centre (CIC-9504), Lariboisiere Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Chiara Trevisan","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Andres Gonzalez-Guerra","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Carrella","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Irina L.

Although several large scale decontamination methods have been proposed (hydrogen peroxide vapor, UV-C); many of them are not applicable in remote and low-resource settings. Heat with humidity has been demonstrated as a promising decontamination approach, but care must be taken when implementing this method at a grassroots level. Here we present a simple, scalable method to provide controlled humidity and temperature for individual N95 respirators which is easily applicable in low-resource settings. N95 respirators were subjected to moist heat (>50% relative humidity, 65-80C temperature) for over 30 minutes by placing them in a sealed container immersed in water that had been brought to a rolling boil and removed from heat, and then allowing the containers to sit for over 45 minutes. Filtration efficiency of 0.3-4.99um incense particles remained above 97% after 5 treatment cycles across all particle size sub-ranges. This method was then repeated at a higher ambient temperature and humidity in Mumbai, using standard utensils commonly found in South Asia. Similar temperatures and humidities were achieved and filtration efficiencies consistently remained above 94%. Higher temperatures (>70C) and longer treatment times (>40 minutes) were obtained by insulating the outer vessel. This simple yet reliable method can be performed even without electricity access using any heat source to boil water, from open-flame stoves to solar heating, and provides a low-cost route for N95 decontamination globally applicable in resource-constrained settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siddharth Doshi","author_inst":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Samhita P.

The analysis reveals that there has been little impact of the nation-wide lockdown and subsequent extension on the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in the country and there is no empirical evidence to suggest that relaxations under the third and the fourth phase of the lockdown has resulted in spiking the reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. The analysis also suggests that if the current trend continues, in the immediate future, then the daily reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country is likely to increase to 21 thousand by 15 June 2020 whereas the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 will increase to around 422 thousand.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aalok Ranjan Chaurasia","author_inst":"MLC Foundation"},{"author_name":"Samhita P.

In hospitals this leads to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission and rapid, accurate diagnostic tests are urgently required. The FebriDx is a point-of-care test that detects an antiviral host response protein in finger prick blood within 10 minutes, but its accuracy for the detection of COVID-19 is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FebriDx in hospitalised patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated based on FebriDx results compared to the reference standard of PCR, and stratified by duration of symptoms. A multivariable predictive model was developed and underwent internal validation. Results FebriDx was performed on 251 patients and gave a valid result in 248. 118 of 248 (48%) were PCR positive for COVID-19. Sensitivity of FebriDx for the identification of COVID-19 was 93% (110\/118; 95% CI 87 to 97%) and specificity was 86% (112\/130; 95%CI 79 to 92%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.73 (95%CI 4.37 to 10.37) and 0.08 (95%CI 0.04 to 0.15) respectively. In the multivariate model diagnosis of COVID-19 was not significantly influenced by clinical symptoms and signs, and FebriDx accuracy was not improved by restricting testing to those with duration of symptoms of less than seven days. Conclusions During the first wave of the pandemic, FebriDx had high sensitivity for the identification of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults and could be deployed as a front door triage tool.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tristan William Clark","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Nathan James Brendish","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Stephen Poole","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Vasanth V Naidu","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mansbridge","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Norton","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Helen Wheeler","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Laura Presland","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sean Ewings","author_inst":"Southampton Clinical Trials Unit, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Habtamu Gezahegn","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Physiology, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Tadesse Awoke","author_inst":"University of Gondar, Colleague of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Gondar, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Bruce John Edward Quisido","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Nursing, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Elise Dalmas","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Venteclef","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes, Clinical Investigation Centre (CIC-9504), Lariboisiere Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Chiara Trevisan","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Andres Gonzalez-Guerra","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Carrella","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Irina L.

The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and mortality rates reported in each country between 1st Jan and 31st Mar 2020 were compared with the country's three-month average atmospheric air temperature, precipitation and latitude. Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) was used to identify significant correlations. Our analysis included a total of 748,555 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide. The total number of patients with COVID-19 decreased with increasing atmospheric air temperature (rs = -0.54, 95%CI: [-0.64, -0.42]; P <0.001) and increased with an increasing latitude (rs =0.60, 95%CI: [0.48, 0.70]; P <0.001).

In the absence of a standard of care, early diagnosis and opt-in therapy with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were offered. Methods: We reviewed records of COVID-19 pneumonia patients from March 16-April 26 2020. Based on NEWS score, we stratified patients as A: low B: medium, and C: high clinical severity and obtained pharmacotherapy data. Chest-CT-severity-score (CTSS) was used. We defined clinical cure as resolution of symptoms and biomarkers and virologic cure as a PCR above 35 cycles(Ct). Results: We recorded 21 COVID-19 pneumonia patients of whom 19 opted for treatment. Clinical symptoms and laboratory markers at presentation did not significantly correlate with severity. Lower initial viral load significantly correlated with lower levels of clinical and radiological severity (p=0.038). Virologic cure, Ct>35, by day 10, was only 33% in high severity significantly less than categories A and B. We observed 100% clinical cure at day 10 in Category-A, 67% in B, and 33% in C(p<0.05). Patients with the lowest severity had the fastest virologic cure in a mean of 5.8 days from diagnosis, shortest hospitalization and earlier radiological improvement(p<0.005). Ultimately, 18 patients were discharged home in good condition and one remains in the ICU. Conclusion: Viral dynamics matter in COVID-19 pneumonia. An early control of replication may be crucial in averting complications. Early administration of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin potentially explains our 94.7% success rate in treating a fairly complex cohort of COVID-19 pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda Chamieh","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Claude Afif","author_inst":"Saint George Hospital University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gerard El-Hajj","author_inst":"Saint George Hospital University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Omar Zmerli","author_inst":"Saint George Hospital University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Djaffar-Jureidini","author_inst":"Saint George Hospital University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Roy A.
