We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huailiang Wu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Casper JP Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Zonglin He","author_inst":"International school, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Wai-kit Ming","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.11.20021493","rel_title":"Laboratory diagnosis and monitoring the viral shedding of 2019-nCoV infections","rel_date":"2020-02-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.11.20021493","rel_abs":"Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by 2019-nCoV spread rapidly, and elucidation the diagnostic accuracy of different respiratory specimens is crucial for the control and treatment of this diseases. Methods: Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. Finding: Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected [&ge;] 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected [&ge;] 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples. Interpretation: Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP.

The immune vulnerability and genetic variation profiles of SARS-CoV were compared with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In addition, a web portal was developed to broadly share the data and results as a resource for the research community. Using this resource, we showed that genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2 are associated with loss of B cell immunogenicity, an increase in CD4+ T cell immunogenicity, and a minimum loss in CD8+ T cell immunogenicity, indicating the existence of a curious correlation between SARS-CoV-2 genetic evolutions and the immunity pressure from the host. Overall, we present an immunological resource for SARS-CoV-2 that could promote both therapeutic\/vaccine development and mechanistic research.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James Zhu","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jiwoong Kim","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xue Xiao","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yunguan Wang","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Danni Luo","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Chen","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lin Xu","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"He Zhang","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Leonard Moise","author_inst":"EpiVax Inc."},{"author_name":"Andres Gutierrez","author_inst":"EpiVax, Inc"},{"author_name":"Anne S De Groot","author_inst":"Epivax Inc."},{"author_name":"Guanghua Xiao","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Schoggins","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Zhan","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tao Wang","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yang Xie","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Qianting Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.10.20021519","rel_title":"Simulating the infected population and spread trend of 2019-nCov under different policy by EIR model","rel_date":"2020-02-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.10.20021519","rel_abs":"Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hao Xiong","author_inst":"Hainan University"},{"author_name":"Huili Yan","author_inst":"Hainan University"},{"author_name":"Xue Xiao","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yunguan Wang","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Danni Luo","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Chen","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lin Xu","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"He Zhang","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Leonard Moise","author_inst":"EpiVax Inc."},{"author_name":"Andres Gutierrez","author_inst":"EpiVax, Inc"},{"author_name":"Anne S De Groot","author_inst":"Epivax Inc."},{"author_name":"Guanghua Xiao","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Schoggins","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Zhan","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tao Wang","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yang Xie","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Qianting Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.10.20021584","rel_title":"Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Predicts Severe Illness Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the Early Stage","rel_date":"2020-02-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.10.20021584","rel_abs":"Background: Severe ill patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence. Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a c-index of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of severe illness was 9.1% in age [&ge;] 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients, and half of patients with age [&ge;] 50 and NLR [&ge;] 3.13 would develop severe illness.

Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we show how to predict outbreak size using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average R0 and the underlying heterogeneity. To do so, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory~\\cite{Newman2001} that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R0) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. %, in the case of COVID-19 from 10-70\\% of susceptible individuals.

Large number of samples are still needed to confirm the \"warning value\" of CD4 + T, CD8 + T IL-6 and IL-10.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suxin Wan","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingjie Yi","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shibing Fan","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinglong Lv","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lian Guo","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing Xiao","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kaihu Xiao","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhengjun Yi","author_inst":"School of mathematics and statistics, Chongqing University"},{"author_name":"Mao Qiang","author_inst":"Basic College of Qingdao University, Qingdao"},{"author_name":"Jianglin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bangshuo Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongping Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guiqin Zhou","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ting Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ben Li","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanbin Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhihai Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xianbo Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.10.20021824","rel_title":"Distribution of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic and Correlation with Population Emigration from Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-02-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.10.20021824","rel_abs":"BACKGROUNDS: The ongoing new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. METHODS: The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. FINDINGS: The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. INTERPRETATION: Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zeliang Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi Lu","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Xi Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Guo","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Conghui Liao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qianlin Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Han","author_inst":"Shenyang Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Lu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Mao Qiang","author_inst":"Basic College of Qingdao University, Qingdao"},{"author_name":"Jianglin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bangshuo Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongping Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guiqin Zhou","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ting Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ben Li","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanbin Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhihai Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xianbo Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.11.20022111","rel_title":"Healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerabilities towards the 2019-nCoV epidemic across China","rel_date":"2020-02-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.11.20022111","rel_abs":"We integrate the human movement and healthcare resource data to identify cities with high vulnerability towards the 2019-nCoV epidemic with respect to available health resources.

Wuhan is the disaster area, where the number of cases has increased rapidly. However, the current measures of infected patients in Wuhan are still underestimated. Objective: To estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan from several sampled data. The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs. Design: We proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey. Setting: We estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province. Participants: The number of people who returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou was selected from the daily notification of the pneumonia epidemic caused by a new coronavirus infection in the city. Exposures for observational studies: The daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan. Based on this rate, it is reasonable to predict the number of the infected patients.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongdao Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of Statistics, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China"},{"author_name":"Jianghu Dong","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, USA"},{"author_name":"Yurui Cai","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qin Liu","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xue Li","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaoping Zeng","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanpeng Chu","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fangcheng Zhu","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fanxin Zeng","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Lu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Mao Qiang","author_inst":"Basic College of Qingdao University, Qingdao"},{"author_name":"Jianglin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bangshuo Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongping Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guiqin Zhou","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ting Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ben Li","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanbin Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhihai Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xianbo Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.08.20021212","rel_title":"Caution on Kidney Dysfunctions of 2019-nCoV Patients","rel_date":"2020-02-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.08.20021212","rel_abs":"Summary Background: To date, large amounts of epidemiological and case study data have been available for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which suggested that the mortality was related to not just respiratory complications. Here, we specifically analyzed kidney functions in COVID-19 patients and their relations to mortality. Methods: In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we included 193 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 hospitals in Wuhan, 1 hospital in Huangshi (Hubei province, 83 km from Wuhan) and 1 hospital in Chongqing (754 km from Wuhan). Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected, including data regarding to kidney functions. Data were compared among three groups: non-severe COVID-19 patients (128), severe COVID-19 patients (65) and a control group of other pneumonia (28). For the data from computed tomographic (CT) scans, we also included a control group of healthy subjects (110 cases, without abnormalities in the lung and without kidney diseases). The primary outcome was a common presence of kidney dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in a fraction of COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included a survival analysis of COVID-19 patients in conditions of AKI or comorbid chronic illnesses. Findings: We included 193 COVID-19 patients (128 non-severe, 65 severe (including 32 non-survivors), between January 6th and February 21th,2020; the final date of follow-up was March 4th, 2020) and 28 patients of other pneumonia (15 of viral pneumonia, 13 of mycoplasma pneumonia) before the COVID-19 outbreak. On hospital admission, a remarkable fraction of patients had signs of kidney dysfunctions, including 59% with proteinuria, 44% with hematuria, 14% with increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, and 10% with increased levels of serum creatinine, although mild but worse than that in cases with other pneumonia. While these kidney dysfunctions might not be readily diagnosed as AKI at admission, over the progress during hospitalization they could be gradually worsened and diagnosed as AKI. A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, uric acid as well as D-dimer were significantly associated with the death of COVID-19 patients respectively. Importantly, the Cox regression analysis also suggested that COVID-19 patients that developed AKI had a ~5.3-times mortality risk of those without AKI, much higher than that of comorbid chronic illnesses (~1.5 times risk of those without comorbid chronic illnesses). Interpretation: To prevent fatality in such conditions, we suggested a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of severe COVID-19 patients regardless of the past disease history. In addition, upon day-by-day monitoring, clinicians should consider any potential interventions to protect kidney functions at the early stage of the disease and renal replacement therapies in severely ill patients, particularly for those with strong inflammatory reactions or a cytokine storm.

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guoshuai Cai","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Zhen Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology,  Tongji Hospital,  Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Wu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, the General Hospital of Central Theater Command and Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Jiwei Yao","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Jie Guo","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 43500"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liao","author_inst":"Center for Neurointelligence, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."},{"author_name":"Siji Song","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Jiali Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology,  Tongji Hospital,  Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Guangjie Duan","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038,China."},{"author_name":"Yuanxiu Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Zhansong Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Taojiao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Ming Hu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.07.20021196","rel_title":"Tracking the spread of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) based on big data","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.07.20021196","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in Wuhan in late 2019 have infected 34,598 people, and killed 723 among them until 8th February 2020.

We used the traffic flow data from Baidu Map, and number of air passengers who left Wuhan from 1st January to 26th January, to quantify the potential infectious people. We developed multiple linear models with local population and air passengers as predicted variables to explain the variance of confirmed cases in every city across China. We found the contribution of air passengers from Wuhan was decreasing gradually, but the effect of local population was increasing, indicating the trend of local transmission. However, the increase of local transmission is slow during the early stage of novel coronavirus, due to the super strict control measures carried out by government agents and communities.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xumao Zhao","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xinhai Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jiwei Yao","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Jie Guo","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 43500"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liao","author_inst":"Center for Neurointelligence, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."},{"author_name":"Siji Song","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Jiali Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology,  Tongji Hospital,  Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Guangjie Duan","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038,China."},{"author_name":"Yuanxiu Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Zhansong Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Taojiao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Ming Hu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.07.20021154","rel_title":"The Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is Highly Contagious and More Infectious Than Initially Estimated","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.07.20021154","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020.

However, the clinical symptoms varied in different reports. Based on the results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weicheng Liang","author_inst":"The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Feng","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shitao Rao","author_inst":"The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Cuicui Xiao","author_inst":"The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zexiao Lin","author_inst":"The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wei Qi","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yichi Yang","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Baoyin Yuan","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Andrei R.

Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joel Hellewell","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Amy Gimma","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Nikos I Bosse","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"James D Munday","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"CMMID nCoV working group","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Funk","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taojiao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Ming Hu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.10.20021675","rel_title":"Epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.10.20021675","rel_abs":"Our manuscript was based on surveillance cases of COVID-19 identified before January 26, 2020.

However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. Methods and findings: We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6{+\/-}10 in Wuhan and March 20{+\/-}16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly. Conclusions: The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinhai Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xumao Zhao","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yuehua Sun","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yixing Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Anran Zhang","author_inst":"Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Neda Jalali","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Natalie Dean","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Ira Longini","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"M.

The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios. The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaolin Zhu","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Aiyin Zhang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shuai Xu","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Jia","author_inst":"China Academy of Urban Planning and Design"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Tan","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Jiaqi Tian","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Tao Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Zhenxian Quan","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Jiali Yu","author_inst":"China Academy of Urban Planning and Design"},{"author_name":"Bo Xu","author_inst":"Army Engineering University of PLA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoai Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Liping Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Liqun Fang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.07.937862","rel_title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus - The species and its viruses, a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.07.937862","rel_abs":"The present outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections, including respiratory distress syndrome, is the third spillover, in only two decades, of an animal coronavirus to humans resulting in a major epidemic. Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2\/Isolate\/Host\/Date\/Location. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This research will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander E.

As of February 7, 2020, 44 strains of the virus have been sequenced and uploaded to NCBIs GenBank [1], providing insight into the viruss evolutionary history and pathogenesis. Here, we present the WashU Virus Genome Browser, a web-based portal for viewing virus genomic data. The browser is home to 16 complete 2019-nCoV genome sequences, together with hundreds of related viral sequences including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus. In addition, the browser features unique customizability, supporting user-provided upload of novel viral sequences in various formats. Sequences can be viewed in both a track-based representation as well as a phylogenetic tree-based view, allowing the user to easily compare sequence features across multiple strains. The WashU Virus Genome Browser inherited many features and track types from the WashU Epigenome Browser, and additionally incorporated a new type of SNV track to address the specific needs of viral research. Our Virus Browser portal can be accessed at https:\/\/virusgateway.wustl.edu, and documentation is available at https:\/\/virusgateway.readthedocs.io\/.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer Flynn","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Deepak Purushotham","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Mayank NK Choudhary","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhuo","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Changxu Fan","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Gavriel Matt","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Daofeng Li","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Ting Wang","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Jiali Yu","author_inst":"China Academy of Urban Planning and Design"},{"author_name":"Bo Xu","author_inst":"Army Engineering University of PLA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoai Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Liping Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Liqun Fang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.08.20021311","rel_title":"Assessing the plausibility of subcritical transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.08.20021311","rel_abs":"Abstract: The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread. While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seth Blumberg","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Thomas M Lietman","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Travis C Porco","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhuo","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Changxu Fan","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Gavriel Matt","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Daofeng Li","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Ting Wang","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Jiali Yu","author_inst":"China Academy of Urban Planning and Design"},{"author_name":"Bo Xu","author_inst":"Army Engineering University of PLA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoai Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Liping Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Liqun Fang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.07.939389","rel_title":"The Pathogenicity of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in hACE2 Transgenic Mice","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.07.939389","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in China has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Based on angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV, we used the hACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenicity of the virus. Weight loss and virus replication in lung were observed in hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical histopathology was interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of significant lymphocytes and monocytes in alveolar interstitium, and accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities. Viral antigens were observed in the bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelia. The phenomenon was not found in wild type mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 mice was clarified and the Kochs postulates were fulfilled as well, and the mouse model may facilitate the development of therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":49,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linlin Bao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei
