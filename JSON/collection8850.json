Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies is critical for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID-19 reported cases show more than 80 percent of infected had a mild case of disease, while around 14 percent of infected experienced a severe one and about 5 percent are categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (2020-04-05; daily updates in the prepared website) shows the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US, Spain, Italy, and Germany are 308850, 126168, 124632, and 96092; respectively. Calculating the total Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of Italy (2020-04-04), about 13.3% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared to South Korea's rate of 1.8% (7 times lower than Italy) and China's 4% (69% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. There are some effective policies that yield significant changes in the trend of cases. The lockdown policy in China, Italy, and Spain (the effect observed after some days), Shutdown of all non-essential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined policy in South Korea, and reducing working hours in Iran.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amirhoshang Hoseinpour Dehkordi","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences"},{"author_name":"Majid Alizadeh","author_inst":"University of Tehran"},{"author_name":"Pegah Derakhshan","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peyman Babazadeh","author_inst":"Islamic Azad University Central Tehran Branch"},{"author_name":"Arash Jahandideh","author_inst":"Iran polymer and petrochemical institute IPPI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.14.20036202","rel_title":"Propagation analysis and prediction of the COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.14.20036202","rel_abs":"Based on the official data modeling, this paper studies the transmission process of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As a result of narrow case definitions and limited capacity for testing, the number of unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections during its initial invasion of the US remains unknown. We developed an approach for estimating the number of unobserved infections based on data that are commonly available shortly after the emergence of a new infectious disease. The logic of our approach is, in essence, that there are bounds on the amount of exponential growth of new infections that can occur during the first few weeks after imported cases start appearing. Applying that logic to data on imported cases and local deaths in the US through March 12, we estimated that 22,876 (95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) infections occurred in the US by this date. By comparing the model's predictions of symptomatic infections to local cases reported over time, we obtained daily estimates of the proportion of symptomatic infections detected by surveillance. This revealed that detection of symptomatic infections decreased throughout February as exponential growth of infections outpaced increases in testing. Between February 21 and March 12, we estimated an increase in detection of symptomatic infections, which was strongly correlated (median: 0.97, 95% PPI: 0.85 - 0.98) with increases in testing. These results suggest that testing was a major limiting factor in assessing the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during its initial invasion of the US.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M.

Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increased by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of \"daily settlement\" (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could started to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10,500 could achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, \"daily settlement\" for all suspected cases would be achieved immediately. Conclusions: Large-scale and standardized clinical testing platform with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing and immunoprotein assessment capabilities need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost. Such infrastructure like Huo-Yan, is of great significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases for both common times and emergencies.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qing Xie","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jianling You","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhou","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Zhijian Tian","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Wu","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Lin","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Xiao","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jianjuan Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jie Dong","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"MGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China."},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"MGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Ye Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Mu","author_inst":"MGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.14.20036178","rel_title":"Correcting under-reported COVID-19 case numbers","rel_date":"2020-03-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.14.20036178","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide in a matter of a few months, while healthcare systems struggle to monitor and report current cases. Testing results have struggled with the relative capabilities, testing policies and preparedness of each affected country, making their comparison a non-trivial task. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases, the reported virus mortality is likely inflated in most countries. Lockdowns and changes in human behavior modulate the underlying growth rate of the virus. Under-sampling of infection cases may lead to the under-estimation of total cases, resulting in systematic mortality estimation biases. For healthcare systems worldwide it is important to know the expected number of cases that will need treatment. In this manuscript, we identify a generalizable growth rate decay reflecting behavioral change. We propose a method to correct the reported COVID-19 cases and death numbers by using a benchmark country (South Korea) with near-optimal testing coverage, with considerations on population demographics. We extrapolate expected deaths and hospitalizations with respect to observations in countries that passed the exponential growth curve. By applying our correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries and a significant burden on worldwide hospital capacity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Lachmann","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M Jagodnik","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Federico Manuel Giorgi","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Forest Ray","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhou","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Zhijian Tian","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Wu","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Lin","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Xiao","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jianjuan Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jie Dong","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"MGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China."},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"MGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Ye Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Mu","author_inst":"MGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.15.20036707","rel_title":"Temporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.15.20036707","rel_abs":"We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and modelled COVID-19 infectiousness profile from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs.

While molecular assays to directly detect the viral genetic material are available for the diagnosis of acute infection, we currently lack serological assays suitable to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Using negative control samples representing pre-COVID 19 background immunity in the general adult population as well as samples from COVID19 patients, we demonstrate that these assays are sensitive and specific, allowing for screening and identification of COVID19 seroconverters using human plasma\/serum as early as two days post COVID19 symptoms onset. Importantly, these assays do not require handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amendable to scaling. Such serological assays are of critical importance to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. Sensitive and specific identification of coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers may, in the future, also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients minimizing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stadlbauer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shirin Strohmeier","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Thi Nguyen","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Melbourne, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection & Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Veronika Chromikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meagan McMahon","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kaijun Jiang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Guha Asthagiri-Arunkumar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Denise Jurczyszak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jose Polanco","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Maria Bermudez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Giulio Kleiner","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Teresa Aydillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fierer","author_inst":"daniel.fierer@mssm.edu"},{"author_name":"Luz Amarilis Lugo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erna Milunka Kojic","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stoever","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sean T.H.

This summary may help to understand the disease dynamics in the early phase of COVID19 outbreak, therefore, to guide future public health measures.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- COVID-19 National Emergency Response Center Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Young June Choe","author_inst":"Hallym University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mahen Perera","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kenrie Hui","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Michael Chan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Malik Peiris","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Leo Poon","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Denise Jurczyszak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jose Polanco","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Maria Bermudez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Giulio Kleiner","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Teresa Aydillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fierer","author_inst":"daniel.fierer@mssm.edu"},{"author_name":"Luz Amarilis Lugo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erna Milunka Kojic","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stoever","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sean T.H.

To be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. At the moment, the WHO-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~100, respectively), however, over 80% of adult- and 95% of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. Therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole Covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal. Methods We compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 Chinese provinces. This cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 disease with both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. Results The full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. There were 6 (0.13%) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25.5 years and 2 males with a median age of 36 years. The median incubation period of both male and female adults was similar (7-day) but significantly shorter than that (9-day) of child cases (P=0.02). This cohort contained 4 transmission generations, and incubation periods of the cases between generations were not significantly different, suggesting that the virus has not been rapidly adapted to human beings. Interestingly, incubation periods of 233 cases (11.6%) were longer than the WHO-established quarantine period (14 days). Data modeling suggested that if adults take an extra 4-day or 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 18 or 21 days), 96.2% or 98.3%, respectively, of the people who are developing symptoms will be more effectively quarantined. Patients transmitted via lunch\/dinner parties (i.e., gastrointestinal tract infection through oral transmission) had a significantly longer incubation period (9-day) than other adults transmitted via respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces and objects (P<0.004). Conclusions The whole Covid-19 population including both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases had a median incubation period of 7-day for adults, which is 1.8-day longer than the hospitalized cases reported previously. An extension of the adult quarantine period to 18 days or 21 days could be more effective in preventing virus-spreading and controlling the disease. The cases transmitted by lunch\/dinner parties could be infected first in the gastrointestinal tract through oral transmission and then infected in the respiratory system so that they had a longer incubation period.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xue Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Mental Health Center, School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China"},{"author_name":"Yawei Niu","author_inst":"Cumming School Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, T2N 4N1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Xiong Li","author_inst":"Cumming School Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, T2N 4N1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Lin Li","author_inst":"Cumming School Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, T2N 4N1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Wenxiang Cai","author_inst":"Shanghai Mental Health Center, School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China"},{"author_name":"Yucan Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Mental Health Center, School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Liao","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, Hainan Normal University, Haikou, Hainan, China"},{"author_name":"Edwin Wang","author_inst":"Cumming School Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, T2N 4N1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Denise Jurczyszak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jose Polanco","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Maria Bermudez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Giulio Kleiner","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Teresa Aydillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fierer","author_inst":"daniel.fierer@mssm.edu"},{"author_name":"Luz Amarilis Lugo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erna Milunka Kojic","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stoever","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sean T.H.

The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China. Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 ). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: A total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate of 95.80% ). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients (OR=1.477, 95%CI:1.069-2.040) were risk factors for GAD, while higher participants self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (OR=0.807, 95%CI:0.700-0.930) was a protective factor. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), longer average working times per week for family members (that is, HCWs) (OR=1.017, 95%CI:1.005-1.029), being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms (OR=3.526, 95%CI:1.609-7.728 and OR=1.639, 95%CI:1.096-2.451, respectively). In addition, compared with participants who were HCWs, participants who were enterprise workers and were more likely to develop depressive symptoms(OR=1.750, 95%CI:1.104-2.776), while who were government employees or institutions employees were less likely to suffer depressive symptoms (OR=0.529, 95%CI:0.286-0.977). Conclusions: Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to pay more attention on the mental health status of this vulnerable but often unseen populations during COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuchen Ying","author_inst":"Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315010, P.R.

Objective: To apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among the general public in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to 3,000 adults residing in the US and 3,000 adults residing in the UK who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Strata by age (18 - 27, 28 - 37, 38 - 47, 48 - 57, or >=58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (White, Black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, Mixed, or \"Other\"), and all permutations of these strata, were established. The number of participants who could enrol in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrolment into the survey within the strata was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2 2020. Results: 2,986 and 2,988 adults residing in the US and the UK, respectively, completed the questionnaire. 64.4% (1,924\/2,986) of US and 51.5% (1,540\/2,988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree. 67.5% (2,015\/2,986) of US participants had a total household income between $20,000 and $99,999, and 74.4% (2,223\/2,988) of UK participants had a total household income between GBP15,000 and GBP74,999. US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 5.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of Covid-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI: 36.1% - 39.6%) of US and 29.7% (95% CI: 28.1% - 31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was 'highly effective' in protecting them from acquiring Covid-19. 25.6% (95% CI: 24.1% - 27.2%) of US and 29.6% (95% CI: 28.0% - 31.3%) of UK participants thought it prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8% [95% CI: 52.1% - 55.6%] of US and 39.1% [95% CI: 37.4% - 40.9%] of UK participants) thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public's knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pascal Geldsetzer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Fanqian Kong","author_inst":"Department of medical record and statistics, Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Hospital, Ningbo,Zhejiang 315041, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Zhu","author_inst":"Department of anesthesiology, the Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo 315020, P.R.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the RBD have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, firstly we analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and the human ACE2 receptor. Among 1609 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated during the early transmission phase, 32 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and found clustered into nine mutant types under high positive selection pressure. Applying molecular dynamics simulations, three mutant types (V367F, W436R, N354D\/D364Y) displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2, likely due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The increased infectivity of one mutant (V367F) circulating worldwide was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Genome phylogenetic analysis of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F + D614G), which emerged later and formed a distinct sub-cluster. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 under high selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junxian Ou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Zhonghua Zhou","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, College of Life Science and Te"},{"author_name":"Ruixue Dai","author_inst":"Fudan University Department of Environmental Science and Engineering"},{"author_name":"Shan Zhao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Wu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Virology, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510632, China"},{"author_name":"Wendong Lan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Lilian Cui","author_inst":"Novoprotein Scientific Inc"},{"author_name":"Jianguo Wu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Virology, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510632, China"},{"author_name":"Donald Seto","author_inst":"Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA"},{"author_name":"James Chodosh","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Howe Laboratory Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Gong Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, College of Life Science and Te"},{"author_name":"Qiwei Zhang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fierer","author_inst":"daniel.fierer@mssm.edu"},{"author_name":"Luz Amarilis Lugo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erna Milunka Kojic","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stoever","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sean T.H.

Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

RBD appears monomer in solutions, whereas S1 and S associate into homotrimer with substantial glycosylation. The three proteins confer excellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer dominate in a unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion conformation of coronaviruses by the upper S1 region at lower position ~15 [A] proximal to viral membrane.

Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, medical resources should be increased in cities under lockdown. Implementation of these measures would reduce the spread of the virus to other cities and allow appropriate treatment of patients in cities under lockdown.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peng Shao","author_inst":"Xi'an Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Qingbing Zheng","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Hai Yu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Dinghui Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wenhui Xue","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yuyun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofen Huang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Lizhi Zhou","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghui Zha","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tingting Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhiping Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jie Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Hui Sun","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tingting Deng","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yingbin Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yixin Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qinjian Zhao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ying Gu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shaowei Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allen Cheng","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki \/ Medicum"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Thomas Moran","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.15.993097","rel_title":"Cross-reactive antibody response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.15.993097","rel_abs":"The World Health Organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also has important implications in vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huibin Lv","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C.

The rates can be manipulated by non-therapeutic interventions and determine the basic reproduction number, R = r_C\/r_E, and, together with {tau}, the daily multiplication coefficient at the early exponential phase, {beta}. Initial {beta} determines the reduction of r_C required to contain epidemic spread. In the long-term, we consider a scenario based on typical social behaviours, in which r_C first decreases in response to a surge of daily new cases, forcing people to self-isolate, and then slowly increases when people gradually accept higher risk. Consequently, initial abrupt epidemic spread is followed by a plateau and slow regression. This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, will grant time to develop, produce, and distribute a vaccine, or at least limit daily cases to a manageable number.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marek Kochanczyk","author_inst":"Institute of Fundamental Technological Research"},{"author_name":"Frederic Grabowski","author_inst":"University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Lipniacki","author_inst":"Institute of Fundamental Technological Research"},{"author_name":"Meng Yuan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ranawaka A.

The infection mechanism of a city is depicted using the philosophy of cybernetics and approaches of the control engineering. Distinguished with other epidemiological models, such as SIR, SEIR, etc., that compute the theoretical number of infected people in a closed population, CDIM considers the immigration and emigration population as system inputs, and administrative and medical resources as dynamic control variables.

Comparable to the first SARS-CoV, this novel coronaviruss surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE-2 receptor, and, thus, is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 [A]. We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the \"closed\" prefusion S structure, but is accessible in \"open\" conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSHigh resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD).\n\nRecognition of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by SARS-CoV antibodies.\n\nStructure of the SARS-COV-2 RBD in complex with antibody CR3022.\n\nIdentification of a cryptic site of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M.

We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yun Qiu","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wei Shi","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Misook Choe","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Hongjun Bai","author_inst":"MHRP, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Agnes Hajduczki","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Lianying Yan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Spencer L Sterling","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Peterson","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Ethan C Green","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Clayton Smith","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Natalia de Val","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Mihret Amare","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Paul Scott","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Eric D Laing","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Christopher C Broder","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgane Rolland","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Nelson L Michael","author_inst":"Walter Reed Army Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"Kayvon Modjarrad","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhijie Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Wenqing Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Luke W.
