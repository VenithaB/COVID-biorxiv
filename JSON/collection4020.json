We here present a model to explore how both individual observation and social learning are likely to shape behavioral, and therefore epidemiological, dynamics over time. Efforts to delay and reduce infections can compromise their own success, especially in populations with age-structure in both disease risk and social learning - two critical features of the current COVID-19 crisis. Our results concur with anecdotal observations of age-based differences in reactions to public health recommendations. We show how shifting reliance on types of learning affect the course of an outbreak, and could therefore factor into policy-based interventions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon Carrignon","author_inst":"NIMBioS, University of Tennessee, Knoxville"},{"author_name":"R.

However, it is currently unknown whether poor or non- availability of these services are also closely related to COVID-19 fatalities. We analysed the latest data on COVID-19 fatality rates in Sub Saharan Africa with indicators of safe water and sanitation governance to test this hypothesis. We found a strong correlation between a higher case fatality rate and poorer access to safe drinking water as well as safe sanitation. The Pearson correlation is stronger for access to safe sanitation ( -0.30) compared to access to safe drinking water (-0.20). The Chad, Niger and Sierra Leone were amongst the countries with the highest fatality rates (>6.0) and also had particularly poor access to safe drinking water (<34%) and safe sanitation (<22%). The hypothesis of an association between COVID-19 fatalities and poor access to water and sanitation was confirmed by this study. However, our analysis does not establish causality. Given the increase spread of COVID-19 and related deaths, this analysis serves as an important reminder that safe water and sanitation services are key for public health interventions and highlights the need to prioritise this sector in all economies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Godfred Amankwaa","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Christian Fischer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew Silk","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Nina H Fefferman","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20120584","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 virus and antibodies in front-line Health Care Workers in an acute hospital in London: preliminary results from a longitudinal study","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20120584","rel_abs":"Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 infection in Healthcare Workers (HCWs) is a public health concern during the pandemic. Little description has been made of their antibody response over time in the presence or absence detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA and of symptoms. We followed a cohort of patient-facing HCWs at an acute hospital in London to measure seroconversion and RNA detection at the peak of the pandemic in London. Methods We enrolled 200 front-line HCWs between 26 March and 8 April 2020 and collected twice-weekly self-administered nose and throat swabs and monthly blood samples. Baseline and regular symptom data were also collected. Swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and serum for IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies to the virus spike protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. Findings We enrolled HCWs with a variety of roles who worked in areas where COVID-19 patients were admitted and cared for. During the first month of observation, 42\/200 (21%) HCWs were PCR positive in at least one nose and throat swab. Only 8\/42 HCW (19%) who were PCR positive during the study period had symptoms that met the current case definition. Of 181 HCWs who provided enrollment and follow-up blood samples, 82\/181 (45.3%) were seropositive; 36\/181 (19.9%) seroconverted during the study and 46\/181 (25.4%) were seropositive at both time points. In 33 HCWs who had positive serology at baseline but were PCR negative, 32 remained PCR negative throughout follow-up. One HCW had a PCR positive swab six days after enrollment, likely representing a waning infection. Interpretation The extremely high seropositivity and RNA detection in this cohort of front-line HCWs who worked during the peak of the pandemic brings policies to protect staff and patients in the hospital environment into acute focus. Our findings have implications for planning for the expected second wave and for future vaccination roll out campaigns in similar settings. The further evidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection indicates that asymptomatic surveillance of HCWs is essential while our study sets the foundations to answer pertinent questions around the duration of protective immune response and the risk of re-infection.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catherine Houlihan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nina Vora","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Thomas Byrne","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Dan Lewer","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Judith Heaney","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"David A Moore","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Matthews","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Sajida Adam","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Louise Enfield","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Abigail Severn","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Angela McBride","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Moira Jane Spyer","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Rupert Beale","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Peter Cherepanov","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Gaertner","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"- The SAFER Field Study Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kevin Ng","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Georgina Cornish","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Naomi Walker","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Susan Michie","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Ed Manley","author_inst":"Leeds University"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Lorencatto","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"- The Crick-COVID-Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Richard Gilson","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Sonia Gandhi","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Steve Gamblin","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"George Kassiotis","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura McCoy","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Andrew Hayward","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Eleni Nastouli","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20123414","rel_title":"Sex differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 that underlie disease outcomes","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20123414","rel_abs":"A growing body of evidence indicates sex differences in the clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. However, whether immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 differ between sexes, and whether such differences explain male susceptibility to COVID-19, is currently unknown. In this study, we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers, plasma cytokines, as well as blood cell phenotyping in COVID-19 patients. By focusing our analysis on patients with mild to moderate disease who had not received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines and chemokines including IL-8, IL-18, and CCL5, along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. In contrast, female patients mounted significantly more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was sustained in old age. Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients age and was predictive of worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. Conversely, higher innate immune cytokines in female patients associated with worse disease progression, but not in male patients. These findings reveal a possible explanation underlying observed sex biases in COVID-19, and provide important basis for the development of sex-based approach to the treatment and care of men and women with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Takehiro Takahashi","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wong","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Mallory Ellingson","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Carolina Lucas","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jon Klein","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Israelow","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Julio Silva","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jieun Oh","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Tianyang Mao","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Maria Tokuyama","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Lu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Annsea Park","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Feimei Liu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Amit Meir","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sun","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Eric Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

We studied the relationship between anti-spike ectodomain (ECD) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG titers, and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization (VN) titers generated by two different in vitro assays using convalescent plasma samples obtained from 68 COVID-19 patients, including 13 who donated plasma multiple times. Only 23% (16\/68) of donors had been hospitalized. We also studied 16 samples from subjects found to have anti-spike protein IgG during surveillance screening of asymptomatic individuals. We report a strong positive correlation between both plasma anti-RBD and anti-ECD IgG titers, and in vitro VN titer. Anti-RBD plasma IgG correlated slightly better than anti-ECD IgG titer with VN titer. The probability of a VN titer [&ge;]160 was 80% or greater with anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers of [&ge;]1:1350. Thirty-seven percent (25\/68) of convalescent plasma donors lacked VN titers [&ge;]160, the FDA-recommended level for convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment. Dyspnea, hospitalization, and disease severity were significantly associated with higher VN titer. Frequent donation of convalescent plasma did not significantly decrease either VN or IgG titers. Analysis of 2,814 asymptomatic adults found 27 individuals with anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers of [&ge;]1:1350, and evidence of VN [&ge;]1:160. Taken together, we conclude that anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers can serve as a surrogate for VN titers to identify suitable plasma donors. Plasma anti-RBD or anti-ECD titer of [&ge;]1:1350 may provide critical information about protection against COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Salazar","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Suresh V Kuchipudi","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University University Park : Penn State"},{"author_name":"Paul A Christensen","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Todd N Eagar","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Yi","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Picheng Zhao","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhicheng Jin","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"S.

As the function of the non-structural ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of host-pathogen relationship is still obscure, we investigated its role in host factor mimicry using computational protein modelling techniques. Modest sequence similarity of ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 with the substrate binding site within the C-terminus serine-protease catalytic domain of human complement factor 1 (F1; PDB ID: 2XRC), prompted us to verify their resemblance at the structural level. The modelled ORF8 protein was found to superimpose on the F1 fragment. Further, protein-protein interaction simulation confirmed ORF8 binding to C3b, an endogenous substrate of F1, via F1-interacting region on C3b. Docking results suggest ORF8 to occupy the binding groove adjacent to the conserved \"arginine-serine\" (RS) F1-mediated cleavage sites on C3b. Comparative H-bond interaction dynamics indicated ORF8\/C3b binding to be of higher affinity than the F1\/C3b interaction. Hence, ORF8 is predicted to inhibit C3b proteolysis by competing with F1 for C3b binding using molecular mimicry with a possibility of triggering unregulated complement activation. This could offer a mechanistic premise for the unrestrained complement activation observed in large number of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasdeep Singh","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Medicine-Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sudeshna Kar","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Medicine, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Seyed Ehtesham Hasnain","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Medicine, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Surajit Ganguly","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Medicine-Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Caio Coelho","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Monica Imbernon","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Deligia","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Romain Perbet","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Vincent Florent","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Marc Baroncini","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Florence Pasquier","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Francois Trottein","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Lille"},{"author_name":"Claude-Alain Maurage","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Virginie Mattot","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Paolo Giacobini","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"S.

We analyzed 294 SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and found that IGHV3-53 is the most frequently used IGHV gene for targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. We determined crystal structures of two IGHV3-53 neutralizing antibodies +\/- Fab CR3022 ranging from 2.33 to 3.11 [A] resolution. The germline-encoded residues of IGHV3-53 dominate binding to the ACE2 binding site epitope with no overlap with the CR3022 epitope. Moreover, IGHV3-53 is used in combination with a very short CDR H3 and different light chains. Overall, IGHV3-53 represents a versatile public VH in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, where their specific germline features and minimal affinity maturation provide important insights for vaccine design and assessing outcomes.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meng Yuan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hejun Liu","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C.

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. However, no commercial vaccines against the coronaviruses that can infect humans are available. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs were observed to adopt two different conformational states (lying or standing). Then, structural and immunological analyses were used to explore differences in the immune response with RBDs among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies were induced by the S trimer with the RBD in the \"standing\" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S trimer with the RBD in the \"lying\" state (HCoV-229E), and the affinity between the RBD-specific antibodies and S trimer was also higher in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was much lower and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus. Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.\n\nImportanceOutbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in lying and standing state, respectively. Here, we tested the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that Beta-CoVs RBDs are in a standing state, and their S proteins can induce more neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD. However, HCoV-229E RBD is in a lying state, and its S protein induces a low level of neutralizing antibody targeting RBD. Our results indicate that Alpha-coronavirus is more conducive to escape host immune recognition, and also provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuejun Shi","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Jiale Shi","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Limeng Sun","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yubei Tan","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Gang Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Fenglin Guo","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Guangli Hu","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yanan Fu","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Zhen F.

Researchers immediately leveraged these data to infer the evolutionary relationships among viral samples and to study key biological questions, including whether host viral genome editing and recombination are features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques. There is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with lab-specific practices affect some sequences in the repositories. We find that some recurrent mutations in reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs, co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations. We show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing, and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation and\/or recombination among viral lineages. We suggest how samples can be screened and problematic mutations removed. We also develop tools for comparing and visualizing differences among phylogenies and we show that consistent clade- and tree-based comparisons can be made between phylogenies produced by different groups. These will facilitate evolutionary inferences and comparisons among phylogenies produced for a wide array of purposes. Building on the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser at UCSC, we present a toolkit to compare, analyze and combine SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies, find and remove potential sequencing errors and establish a widely shared, stable clade structure for a more accurate scientific inference and discourse.\n\nForewordWe wish to thank all groups that responded rapidly by producing these invaluable and essential sequence data. Their contributions have enabled an unprecedented, lightning-fast process of scientific discovery---truly an incredible benefit for humanity and for the scientific community. We emphasize that most lab groups with whom we associate specific suspicious alleles are also those who have produced the most sequence data at a time when it was urgently needed. We commend their efforts. We have already contacted each group and many have updated their sequences. Our goal with this work is not to highlight potential errors, but to understand the impacts of these and other kinds of highly recurrent mutations so as to identify commonalities among the suspicious examples that can improve sequence quality and analysis going forward.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yatish Turakhia","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Bryan Thornlow","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Landen Gozashti","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Angie Hinrichs","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Jason Fernandes","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"David Haussler","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Russ Corbett-Detig","author_inst":"UC Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Yanan Fu","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Zhen F.

To gain a better understanding of coronavirus presence and diversity in wildlife at wildlife-human interfaces in three southern provinces in Viet Nam 2013-2014, we used consensus Polymerase Chain Reactions to detect coronavirus sequences. In comparison to previous studies, we observed high proportions of positive samples among field rats (34.0%, 239\/702) destined for human consumption and insectivorous bats in guano farms (74.8%, 234\/313) adjacent to human dwellings. Most notably among field rats, the odds of coronavirus RNA detection significantly increased along the supply chain from field rats sold by traders (reference group; 20.7% positivity, 39\/188) by a factor of 2.2 for field rats sold in large markets (32.0%, 116\/363) and 10.0 for field rats sold and served in restaurants (55.6%, 84\/151). Coronaviruses were detected in the majority of wildlife farms (60.7%, 17\/28) and in the Malayan porcupines (6.0%, 20\/331) and bamboo rats (6.3%, 6\/96) that are farmed. We identified six known coronaviruses in bats and rodents, clustered in three Coronaviridae genera, including the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronaviruses. Our analysis also suggested either mixing of animal excreta in the environment or interspecies transmission of coronaviruses, as both bat and avian coronaviruses were detected in rodent feces in the trade. The mixing of multiple coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the wildlife supply chain into restaurants, suggests maximal risk for end consumers and likely underpins the mechanisms of zoonotic spillover to people.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nguyen Quynh Huong","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Viet Nam Country Program, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Thanh Nga","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Viet Nam Country Program, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Van Long","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Bach Duc Luu","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Alice Latinne","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Viet Nam Country Program, Ha Noi, Viet Nam; Wildlife Conservation Society, Health Program, Bronx, New York, United States of Amer"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Pruvot","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Health Program, Bronx, New York, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Phuong","author_inst":"Regional Animal Health Office No. 6, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Le Tin Vinh Quang","author_inst":"Regional Animal Health Office No. 6, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Vo Van Hung","author_inst":"Regional Animal Health Office No. 6, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Lan","author_inst":"Viet Nam National University of Agriculture, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hoa","author_inst":"Viet Nam National University of Agriculture, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Phan Quang Minh","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Diep","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Tung","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Van Dang Ky","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam; Current address: The Animal Asia Foundation Viet Nam,"},{"author_name":"Scott I.

We developed a reverse transcription nested PCR endpoint assay (RT-nPCR) and showed that RT-nPCR has comparable performance to the standard RT-qPCR test. In the course of comparing the results of both tests, we found that the standard RT-qPCR test can have low detection efficiency (less than 50%) in a real testing scenario which may be only partly explained by low viral representation in many samples. This finding points to the importance of directly monitoring detection efficiency in test environments. We also suggest measures that would improve detection efficiency.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jayeshkumar Narsibhai Davda","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Keith Frank","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Sivakumar Prakash","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Gunjan Purohit","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Devi Prasad Vijayashankar","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Dhiviya Vedagiri","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Karthik Bharadwaj Tallapaka","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Krishnan Harinivas Harshan","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biollgy"},{"author_name":"Archana Bharadwaj Siva","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Kumar Mishra","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Jyotsna Dhawan","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Imran Siddiqi","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Diep","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Tung","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"},{"author_name":"Van Dang Ky","author_inst":"Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development of Viet Nam, Ha Noi, Viet Nam; Current address: The Animal Asia Foundation Viet Nam,"},{"author_name":"Scott I.

Till the second week of April 2020, high incidence (2.9\/100,000) and cases fatality rates (1.7%) were observed in Pakistan. This study was conducted to determine the temporal and spatial distribution of the first 100 deaths attributed to COVID-19 in Pakistan and their associated demographic factors. Method: We conducted a descriptive epidemiological analysis of the first 100 deaths reported among RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases. Demographic, epidemiological, and risk factors information was obtained associated comorbidities and clinical signs and symptoms were recorded and frequencies were determined. Results: A total of 100 mortalities with overall Case Fatality Rate 1.67% (CFR) were analysed. Median age of patients was 64.5 years (IQR: 54-70) with 75% (n=75) Males. Among all deaths reported, 71 (71%) cases had one or more documented comorbidities at the time of diagnosis. Most frequently reported co-morbidities were; hypertension (67 %), followed by Diabetes Mellitus 945%) and Ischemic Heart Diseases (27%). First death was reported on 18 March 2020 and the most frequent presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (87%) and fever (79%). Median duration of illness was eight days (IQR: 4-11 days), the median delay reaching hospital to seek health care was three days (IQR: 0-6 days) while median duration of hospital stay was also three days (IQR: 1-7 days). Among all reported deaths, 62% were attributed to local transmission as these cases had no history of international travel. The most affected age group was 60-69 years while no death reported in age group below 20 years. Conclusion: High CFR among old age group and its association with co-morbidities (chronic disease) suggests targeted interventions such as social distancing and strict quarantine measure for elderly and morbid people. Comparative studies among deaths and recovered patients are recommended to explore further disease dynamics.

Material and methods: Study of qualitative approach, of phenomenological design, where 80 obstetric interns from the different regions of Peru participated, who are also representatives of their hospital headquarters. An in-depth interview was applied where the perception of hospital practices was addressed according to: i) current problems and ii) solution proposals. Results: Midwifery interns have been removed from hospital practices, mainly due to the absence of personal protective equipment and health insurance, financially affecting those who must continue to make rent and food payments; Likewise, a large part of the universities have not offered proposals for solutions to the delay in internships, raising concerns about delays in administrative procedures, even more so for students from non-licensed universities. Among the proposals, those who are close to graduating suggest being exempted from the months when there were no activities, so as not to delay future processes such as tuition and rural service; likewise, suspend payment for these months and strengthen knowledge through the discussion of clinical cases, which could be virtual. Conclusions: The cessation of hospital practice responds to a lack of guarantees in the health care of the student, generating economic repercussions and a negative perception regarding university management. Finally, solutions that could be considered for the next decisions made by the institutions are reported.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica Rojas-Silva Sr.","author_inst":"Asociacion Nacional de Estudiantes de Obstetricia del Peru"},{"author_name":"Valery Damacen-Oblitas Sr.","author_inst":"Asociacion Nacional de Estudiantes de Obstetricia del Peru"},{"author_name":"Diayan Castro-Gomez","author_inst":"Asociacion Nacional de Estudiantes de Obstetricia del Peru"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Rojas-Vega Sr.","author_inst":"Asociacion Nacional de Estudiantes de Obstetricia del Peru"},{"author_name":"John Barja-Ore","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos"},{"author_name":"Randol Vila-Arevalo Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos"},{"author_name":"Victor Hugo Moquillaza-Alcantara Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Jamil Ahmad Ansari","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Asif Syed","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Wasif Javed","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Larik","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Mohsan Wattoo","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Naveed Masood","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training"},{"author_name":"zeeshan Iqbal Baig","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Khurram Akram","author_inst":"Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program"},{"author_name":"Scott I.

In this paper, we develop a clinical strategy for prescribing PCR to patients based on data from COVIDOM, a French cohort of 54,000 patients with clinically suspected Covid-19 including 12,810 patients tested by PCR. Using a machine learning algorithm (a decision tree), we show that symptoms alone are sufficient to predict PCR outcome with a mean average precision of 86%. We identify combinations of symptoms that are predictive of PCR positivity (90% for anosmia\/ageusia) or negativity (only 30% of PCR+ for a subgroup with cardiopulmonary symptoms): in both cases, PCR provides little added diagnostic value. We deduce a prescribing strategy based on clinical presentation that can improve the global efficiency of PCR testing.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- AP-HP \/ Universities \/ Inserm COVID-19 research co COVID-19 research collaboration members","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Caroline Apra","author_inst":"Sorbonne University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Caucheteux","author_inst":"University Paris Saclay"},{"author_name":"Arthur Mensch","author_inst":"Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jenny Mansour","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France"},{"author_name":"Melodie Bernaux","author_inst":"AP-HP, Direction de la strategie et de la transformation, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Agnes dechartres","author_inst":"Sorbonne University, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique, UMR-S 1136, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Erwan Debuc","author_inst":"Sorbonne University, AP-HP, Saint Antoine Hospital, Service d'Accueil des Urgences, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Xavier Lescure","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases , APHP, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Aurelien Dinh","author_inst":"Infectious disease department, R.

is essential to controlling the pandemic and facilitating safe resumption of clinical care, employment and other social activities. Methods: This study was conducted to validate an self-administrable saliva-based RT-qPCR test for the SARS-CoV2 virus under controlled laboratory conditions (analytical validation) according to federal guidance. An additional clinical study assessed positive (n=34) and negative (n=57) nasopharyngeal swab samples collected contemporaneously with saliva samples. Assessments for analytical specificity, sensitivity, cross reactivity and sample stability to simulate shipping conditions were conducted. Results: Positive and negative agreement with third-party laboratory results were reported as 97.1% and 96.5-98.2%, respectively. Limit of detection was established at 5 copies\/L. Stability through simulated shipping conditions found 100% concordance up to 56 hours after collection. Discussion: These data validate a self-collected saliva-based COVID-19 RT-qPCR assay that performs comparably well to an assay of health care-provider administered nasopharyngeal swab samples. Accordingly, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization in June 2020. Use of the saliva-based assay overcomes barriers to the necessary widespread testing, including strained health care resources, supply chain disruptions of laboratory materials, testing and protective equipment and exposure risks due to close interpersonal contact.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meghan Miller","author_inst":"Phosphorus Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Michael

Tocilizumab, a drug targeting interleukin-6 administrated in the right timeframe may be beneficial in coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess its benefit, drawing from observations in compassionately treated patients. Methods: In a retrospective case-control study, treatment effect (tocilizumab 400mg, single-dose) was assessed using three statistical methods: propensity-score matching, Cox multivariable survival and inverse probability score weighting (IPSW) analyses. Were included all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, who presented severity criteria with SpO2<96% despite O2-support >6L\/min for more than 6 hours. Were excluded patients in critical care medicine department and those under invasive mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was a composite of mortality and ventilation, with a maximum follow-up of 28 days. Results: 246 patients were included (106 treated by tocilizumab). They were 67.6 +\/-15.3 years-old, with 95 (38.5%) women. Delay between first symptoms and inclusion was 8.4 +\/-4.5 days. Overall, 105 (42.7%) patients presented the primary outcome, with 71 (28.9%) deaths during the 28-days follow-up. Propensity-score-matched 84 pairs of comparable patients. In the matched cohort (n=168), tocilizumab was associated with fewer primary outcomes (hazard ratio (HR)=0.49 (95% confidence interval (95CI)=0.3-0.81), p-value=0.005). These results were similar in the overall cohort (n=246), with Cox multivariable analysis yielding a protective association between tocilizumab and primary outcome (adjusted HR=0.26 (95CI=0.135-0.51, p=0.0001), confirmed by IPSW analysis (p<0.0001). Analyses on mortality with 28-days follow-up yielded similar results. Conclusion: In this retrospective study, tocilizumab single-dose was associated with improved survival without mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Rossi","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Lee S Nguyen","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Philippe Zimmermann","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Faiza Boucenna","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Louise Baucher","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Louis Dubret","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Helene Guillot","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Marie-anne Bouldouyre","author_inst":"Hopital Robert Ballanger"},{"author_name":"Yves Allenbach","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite -

So far, there is no direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission and the mechanisms leading to the adverse outcomes are not well understood Results An asymptomatic pregnant woman with preterm fetal distress during the COVID19 pandemic was included. We obtained multiple maternal, placental and neonatal swabs, which showed a median viral load in maternal blood, urine, oropharynx, fornix posterior over a period of 6 days was 5.0 log copies \/mL. The maternal side of the placenta had a viral load of 4.42 log copies \/mL, while the fetal side had 7.15 log copies \/mL. Maternal breast milk, feces and all neonatal samples tested negative. Serology of immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 was tested positive in maternal blood, but negative in umbilical cord and neonatal blood. Pathological examination of the placenta included immunohistochemical investigation against SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression in combination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy. It showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles with generalized inflammation characterized by histiocytic intervillositis with diffuse perivillous fibrin depositions with damage to the syncytiotrophoblasts. Discussion Placental infection by SARS-CoV-2 lead to fibrin depositions hampering fetal-maternal gas exchange most likely resulted in fetal distress necessitating a premature emergency caesarean section. Postpartum, the neonate showed a clinical presentation resembling a pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome including coronary artery ectasia, most likely associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) for which admittance and care on the Neonatal Intensive Care unit (NICU) was required, despite being negative for SARS-CoV-2. This highlights the need for awareness of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes during the current COVID-19 pandemic, especially considering that the majority of pregnant women appear asymptomatic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sam Schoenmakers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Pauline Snijder","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rob

indirectly by measuring the host immune response. Anti-viral antibody concentrations generally correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods: Sera (n=533) from patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 (n=153) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative IgM and IgG assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. Results: Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. Conclusions: High sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease. These differences may affect strategies for seroprevalence studies, therapeutics and vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kara Lake Lynch","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

The use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is controversial and its mode of action poorly understood. We demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity at the functional and epigenetic level and is accompanied by profound changes in the cellular lipidome as well as reduced expression of interferon-stimulated genes.

We compare this with the Q-SEIR model, recently developed, and demonstrate the control of COVID-19 without the stringent conditions of community quarantine. We analyzed the sensitivity and elasticity indices of the parameters with respect to the reproduction number. Results suggest that a control strategy that involves maximizing  and {varepsilon} is likely to be successful, although quarantine is still more effective in limiting the spread of the virus. Release from quarantine depends on continuance and strict adherence to recommended social and health-promoting behaviors. Furthermore, maximizing  and {varepsilon} is equivalent to a 50% successful quarantine in disease-free equilibrium (DFE).

Eventually, such characteristics are also observed between different regions of the same country. Herewith, we study the heterogeneous spreading of the confirmed infected cases and deaths by the COVID-19 until May 30th, 2020, in the Brazilian territory, which has been seen as the current epicenter of the pandemic in South America. Our first set of results is related to the similarities and it shows that: (i) a power-law growth of the cumulative number of infected people is observed for federative units of the five regions of Brazil; and (ii) the Distance Correlation (DC) calculated between the time series of the most affected federative units and the curve that describes the evolution of the pandemic in Brazil remains about 1 in most of the time, while such quantity calculated for the federative units with a low incidence of newly infected people remains about 0.95. In the second set of results, we focus on the heterogeneous distribution of the confirmed cases and deaths, which is demonstrated by the fact that only three regions concentrate 92% of the cases. By applying the epidemiological SIRD model we estimated the effective reproduction number Re during the pandemic evolution and found that: (i) the mean value of Re for the eight most affected federative units in Brazil is about 2; (ii) the current value of Re for Brazil is greater than 1, which indicates that the epidemic peak is far; and (iii) Ceara was the only federative unit for which the current Re < 1. Based on these findings, we projected the effects of increase or decrease the effective reproduction number and concluded that if the value of Re increases 20%, not only the peak might grow at least 40% but also its occurrence might be anticipated, which hastens the collapse of the public health care system. In all cases, to keep the effective reproduction number 20% below the current one can save thousands of people in the long term.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael Marques Da Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fabio de Oliveira Mendes","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Amazonas"},{"author_name":"Cesar Manchein","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Salvador E.

Objectives To study whether use of NSAIDs is associated with adverse outcomes and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Population based cohort study Setting Danish administrative and health registries. Participants Individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during Feb 27, 2020 to Apr 29, 2020. Treated individuals (defined as a filled NSAID prescription up to 30 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test) were matched to up to 4 non-treated individuals on propensity scores based on age, sex, relevant comorbidities and prescription fills. Outcome measures The main outcome was 30-day mortality and treated individuals were compared to untreated individuals using risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD). Secondary outcomes included hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and acute renal replacement therapy. Results A total of 9236 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive individuals were eligible for inclusion. Of these, 248 (2.7%) had filled a prescription for NSAIDs and 535 (5.8%) died within 30 days. In the matched analyses, treatment with NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.82; RD 0.1%, -3.5% to 3.7%), increased risk of hospitalisation (RR 1.16, 0.87 to 1.53; RD 3.3%, -3.4% to 10%), ICU-admission (RR 1.04, 0.54 to 2.02; RD 0.2%, -3.0% to 3.4%), mechanical ventilation (RR 1.14, 0.56 to 2.30; RD 0.5%, -2.5% to 3.6%), or renal replacement therapy (RR 0.86, 0.24 to 3.09; RD -0.2%, -2.0% to 1.6%).

The S protein is the Trojan horse of coronaviruses, mediating their entry into the host cells. While SARS-CoV-2 was becoming a global threat, scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at an impressive pace, both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional structures. On April 21st, the GISAID resource had collected 10,823 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. We extracted from them all the complete S protein sequences and identified point mutations thereof. Six mutations were located on a 14-residue segment (929-943) in the \"fusion core\" of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1). Our modeling in the pre- and post-fusion S protein conformations revealed, for three of them, the loss of interactions stabilizing the post-fusion assembly. On May 29th, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in GISAID were 34,805. An analysis of the occurrences of the HR1 mutations in this updated dataset revealed a significant increase for the S929I and S939F mutations and a dramatic increase for the D936Y mutation, which was particularly widespread in Sweden and Wales\/England.

Aim To explore patterns of mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for palliative care provision, planning, and research. Design Descriptive analysis and population-based modelling of routine data. Participants and setting All deaths registered in England and Wales between 7th March and 15th May 2020. We described the following mortality categories by age, gender and place of death: 1) baseline deaths (deaths that would typically occur in a given period) 2) COVID-19 deaths 3) additional deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19. We estimated the proportion of COVID-19 deaths among people who would be in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic, using simple modelling with explicit assumptions. Results During the first 10 weeks of the pandemic there were 101,615 baseline deaths, 41,105 COVID-19 deaths and 14,520 additional deaths. Deaths in care homes increased by 220% compared to home and hospital deaths which increased by 77% and 90%. Hospice deaths fell by 20%. Additional deaths were among older people (86% aged [&ge;]75 years), and most occurred in care homes (56%) and at home (43%). We estimate that 44% (38% to 50%) of COVID-19 deaths occurred among people who would have been in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic.
