Studies suggest a variable impact of COVID-19 based on factors such as age, gender, comorbidities and ethnicity. Workplace measures such as personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing (SD) and avoidance of exposure for the vulnerable, mitigate this risk. This online questionnaire-based study explored the impact of gender and religion in addition to workplace measures associated with risk of COVID-19 in hospital doctors in acute and mental health institutions in the UK. The survey had 1206 responses, majority (94%) from BAME backgrounds. A quarter of the respondents had either confirmed or suspected COVID-19, a similar proportion reported inadequate PPE and 2\/3 could not comply with SD. One third reported being reprimanded in relation to PPE or avoidance of risk. In univariate analysis, age over 50 years, being female, Muslim and inability to avoid exposure in the workplace was associated with risk of COVID-19. On multivariate analysis, inadequate PPE remained an independent predictor with a twofold (OR 2.29, (CI - 1.22-4.33), p=0.01) risk of COVID-19. This study demonstrates that PPE, SD and workplace measures to mitigate risk remain important for reducing risk of COVID-19 in hospital doctors. Gender and religion did not appear to be independent determinants. It is imperative that employers consolidate risk reduction measures and foster a culture of safety to encourage employees to voice any safety concerns.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sunil Daga","author_inst":"BAPIO Institute for Health Research"},{"author_name":"Sadaf Jafferbhoy","author_inst":"APPNE, Walsall, UK"},{"author_name":"Geeta Menon","author_inst":"BAPIO Institute for Health Research"},{"author_name":"Mansoor Ali","author_inst":"APPNE, Walsall, UK"},{"author_name":"Subarna Chakravorty","author_inst":"BAPIO Institute for Health Research"},{"author_name":"Saqib Ghani","author_inst":"APPNE, Walsall, UK"},{"author_name":"Amir Burney","author_inst":"APPNE, Walsall, UK"},{"author_name":"JS Bamrah","author_inst":"BAPIO Institute for Health Research, UK"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Mehta","author_inst":"BAPIO Institute for Health Research, BAPIO UK"},{"author_name":"Indranil Chakravorty","author_inst":"BAPIO Institute for Health Research, BAPIO, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20128660","rel_title":"Potential involvement of monoamine oxidase activity in SARS-COV2 infection and delirium onset","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20128660","rel_abs":"Abstract Delirium is an acute change in attention and cognition occurring in ~65% of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases. It is also common following surgery and an indicator of brain vulnerability and risk for the development of dementia. In this work we analyzed the underlying role of metabolism in delirium-susceptibility in the postoperative setting using metabolomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid and blood taken from the same patients prior to planned orthopaedic surgery. Significant concentration differences in several amino acids, acylcarnitines and polyamines were found in delirium-prone patients leading us to a hypothesis about the significance of monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) in predisposition to delirium. Subsequent computational structural comparison between MAOB and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as well as protein-protein docking analysis showed possibly strong binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to MAOB resulting in a hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 influences MAOB activity possibly lead to many observed neurological and platelet-based complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This proposition is possibly of significance for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of vulnerabilities causing delirium, dementias and severe COVID-19 response.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miroslava Cuperlovic-Culf","author_inst":"National Research Council"},{"author_name":"Emma L Cunningham","author_inst":"2Centre for Public Health, Queens University Belfast, Block B, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Royal Victoria Hospital site, Grosvenor Road, Belfast, BT12 6BA, "},{"author_name":"Anuradha Surendra","author_inst":"National Research Council of Canada, Digital Technologies Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada"},{"author_name":"Xiaobei Pan","author_inst":"Institute for Global Food Security, School of Biological Sciences, Queens University Belfast, 8 Malone Road, Belfast, BT9 5BN, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Steffany A.L.

Data of 15 consecutive patients were sequentially recorded from intensive care unit admission. Lymphocyte subsets and total monocyte and subsets counts were monitored as well as the expression of HLA-DR. For 5 patients, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell polyfunctionality was assessed against Spike and Nucleoprotein SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Non-specific inflammation markers were increased in all patients. Median monocyte HLA-DR expression was below the 8,000 AB\/C threshold defining acquired immunodepression. A V trend curve for lymphopenia, monocyte numbers, and HLA-DR expression was observed with a nadir between days 11-14 after the onset of symptoms. Intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes increased early with a reduction in classic CD14++CD16- monocytes. Polyfunctional SARS-Cov-2-specific CD4 T-cells were present and functional, whereas virus-specific CD8 T-cells were less frequent and not efficient. We report a temporal variation of both innate and adaptive immunity in severe COVID-19 patients, helpful in guiding therapeutic decisions (e.g. anti-inflammatory vs. immunostimulatory ones). We describe a defect in virus-specific CD8 T-cells, a potential biomarker of clinical severity. These combined data also provide helpful knowledge for vaccine design.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Didier Payen","author_inst":"University Paris 7 Denis Diderot, UMR 1160 INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Maxime Cravat","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine, CHRU-Nancy, Laboratoire Immunologie"},{"author_name":"Hadil Maadadi","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine, CHRU-Nancy, Departement Anesthesie Reanimation Brabois Adulte, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Carole Didelot","author_inst":"CHRU-Nancy, Plateforme de Cytometrie en Flux Diagnostique, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Lydia Prosic","author_inst":"CHRU-Nancy, Plateforme de Cytometrie en Flux Diagnostique, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Claire Dupuis","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France"},{"author_name":"Marie-Reine Losser","author_inst":"CHRU Nancy and Universite de Lorraine, INSERM UMR 1116, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Marcelo De Carvalho Bittencourt","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine, CHRU-Nancy, CNRS UMR 7365, IMoPA, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Danny McAuley","author_inst":"Centre for Experimental Medicine, Queens University Belfast, Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7BL"},{"author_name":"David Beverland","author_inst":"Outcomes Assessment Unit, Musgrave Park Hospital, Stockmans Lane, Belfast, BT9 7JB, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Brian D.

In the middle of an active outbreak when surveillance data is the primary source of information, estimating these quantities involves compensating for competing biases in time series of deaths, cases, and recoveries. These include time- and severity- dependent reporting of cases as well as time lags in observed patient outcomes. In the context of COVID-19 CFR estimation, we survey such biases and their potential significance. Further, we analyze theoretically the effect of certain biases, like preferential reporting of fatal cases, on naive estimators of CFR. We provide a partially corrected estimator of these naive estimates that accounts for time lag and imperfect reporting of deaths and recoveries. We show that collection of randomized data by testing the contacts of infectious individuals regardless of the presence of symptoms would mitigate bias by limiting the covariance between diagnosis and death.

Here we propose a new strategy, which employs a modified loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, a simple procedure requiring no sophisticated instruments, to index and amplify viral genes from individual specimens, of which the products are readily available for construction of multiplexed libraries for next-generation sequencing. Our strategy would allow precise diagnosis of thousands of specimens in 1-2 days with significantly lower operating expenses. Furthermore, this strategy will make it possible for patients to collect, process, and mail their own samples to facilities for a quick, reliable diagnosis at a population scale.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jian Huang","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lan Zhao","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"ISIL KALELI","author_inst":"Directorate of Antalya Emergency Health Services"},{"author_name":"AYHAN ULASTI","author_inst":"Directorate of Antalya Emergency Medical Services"},{"author_name":"Lydia Prosic","author_inst":"CHRU-Nancy, Plateforme de Cytometrie en Flux Diagnostique, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Claire Dupuis","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France"},{"author_name":"Marie-Reine Losser","author_inst":"CHRU Nancy and Universite de Lorraine, INSERM UMR 1116, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Marcelo De Carvalho Bittencourt","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine, CHRU-Nancy, CNRS UMR 7365, IMoPA, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Danny McAuley","author_inst":"Centre for Experimental Medicine, Queens University Belfast, Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7BL"},{"author_name":"David Beverland","author_inst":"Outcomes Assessment Unit, Musgrave Park Hospital, Stockmans Lane, Belfast, BT9 7JB, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Brian D.

While attention has focused on the effects of these measures on epidemiological indicators relating directly to the infection, there is increased recognition of their broader health implications. However, assessing these implications in real time is a challenge, due to limitations of existing syndromic surveillance data and tools. Objective: To explore the added value of mobile phone app-based symptom assessment tools as real time health insight providers to inform public health policy makers. Methods: A comparative and descriptive analysis of the proportion of all self-reported symptoms entered by users during an Ada assessment in Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) was conducted between two periods: before and after the implementation of Phase One COVID-19 measures. Additional analyses were performed to explore the association between symptom trends and seasonality, and symptom trends and weather. Differences in the proportion of unique symptoms between the periods were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-squared test and reported as Log2 Fold Changes (Log2 FC). Results: Between 48,300-54,900 symptomatic users reported 140,500-170,400 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods in Germany. Between 34,200-37,400 symptomatic users in the UK reported 112,100-131,900 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods. The majority of symptomatic users were female (Germany 68,600\/103,200, 66.52%; UK 51,200\/71,600, 72.74%). The majority (Germany 68,500\/100,000, 68.45%; UK 50,900\/68,800, 73.91%) were aged between 10 and 29 years, and about a quarter (Germany 26,200\/100,000, 26.15%; UK 14,900\/68,800, 21.65%) were between 30-59 years. 103 symptoms were reported either more or less frequently (with statistically significant differences) during the Measures as compared to the Baseline period, and 34 of these were found in both countries. The following mental health symptoms (Log2 FC, P-value) were reported less often during the Measures period: inability to manage constant stress and demands at work (-1.07, P<.001), memory difficulty (-0.56, P<.001), depressed mood (-0.42, P<.001), and impaired concentration (-0.46, P<.001). Diminished sense of taste (2.26, P<.001) and hyposmia (2.20, P<.001) were reported more frequently during the Measures period. None of the 34 symptoms were found to be different between the same dates in 2019. Fourteen of the 34 symptoms had statistically significant associations with weather variables. Conclusions: Symptom assessment apps have an important role to play in facilitating improved understanding of the implications of public health policies such as COVID-19 lockdown measures. Not only do they provide the means to complement and cross-validate hypotheses based on data collected through more traditional channels, they can also generate novel insights through a real-time syndromic surveillance system.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alicia Mehl","author_inst":"Ada Health GmBH"},{"author_name":"Francois Bergey","author_inst":"Ada Health GmbH"},{"author_name":"Caoimhe Cawley","author_inst":"Ada Health GmbH"},{"author_name":"Andreas Gilsdorf","author_inst":"Ada Health GmbH"},{"author_name":"Lydia Prosic","author_inst":"CHRU-Nancy, Plateforme de Cytometrie en Flux Diagnostique, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Claire Dupuis","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France"},{"author_name":"Marie-Reine Losser","author_inst":"CHRU Nancy and Universite de Lorraine, INSERM UMR 1116, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Marcelo De Carvalho Bittencourt","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine, CHRU-Nancy, CNRS UMR 7365, IMoPA, Nancy, France"},{"author_name":"Danny McAuley","author_inst":"Centre for Experimental Medicine, Queens University Belfast, Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7BL"},{"author_name":"David Beverland","author_inst":"Outcomes Assessment Unit, Musgrave Park Hospital, Stockmans Lane, Belfast, BT9 7JB, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Brian D.

Objective: To investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 induced lockdown in Zimbabwe on nutrition, physical activity and lifestyle patterns among Zimbabwean population aged [&ge;]18years. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire to collect information on demographics (age, gender, place of residence, current employment), food system dimensions, diet and physical activity patterns, stress and anxiety, body image perceptions, lifestyle behaviours like smoking, alcohol intake, screen time, and ease of access to health services. Electronic informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to completing the survey. Results: The majority of the participants were between the ages of 31-40 years, were female (63.0%) and had tertiary education (91.3%). The lockdown resulted in increase in food prices (94.8%) and decrease in availability of nutritious foods (64%). Most (62.5%) of the participants reported a reduction in their physical activity levels. The prevalence of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) was 40.4% and mostly affecting females [63.5%, P=0.909), 31-40 years age group (49.6%, P=0.886). Based on the BMI-based Silhouette Matching Test (BMI-SMT) 44.5% gained weight, 24.3% lost weight and 31.2% did not have weight change. The paired samples T test showed that there was a significant increase in perceived body weight (P<0.001). More than half (59.6%) reported having difficulties accessing drugs and medication and 37.8% growth monitoring services. Conclusions: The lockdown period was associated with increase in food prizes, decrease in dietary diversification, elevated stress, disrupted diet and consumption patterns.

We have been performing the qRT-PCR tests established by NIID, and the mean Ct value distribution of 62 cases, which are deemed (first-visit) patients, among the total of 88 positive cases tested in a 4-day window of early April, was 24.9 with SD=5.45. Recently approved antigen testing kits were also used in the same samples (62 positives) along with 100 negative cases, and it revealed the positive predictive value of 80.6% and negative predictive value of 100%, with an overall agreement rate of 92.6%.

Kerala, one of Indias most densely populated states, which makes its success in fighting the Covid-19 all the more commendable. Moreover, an estimated 17% of its 35 million population employed or lives elsewhere, more than 1 million tourists visit each year, and hundreds of students study abroad, including in China. All of this mobility makes the state more vulnerable to contagious outbreaks. What is the strategy behind the success story? This paper compares the situation of COVID-19 pandemic in major states and Kerala by the different phase of lockdown, and also highlights Keralas fight against the pandemic. We used publicly available data from https:\/\/www.covid19india.org\/ and Covid-19 Daily Bulletin (Jan 31-May 31), Directorate of Health Services, Kerala (https:\/\/dashboard.kerala.gov.in\/). We calculate the phase-wise period prevalence rate (PPR) and the case fatality rate (CFR) of the last phase. Compared to other major states, Kerala showed better response in preventing pandemic. The equation for the Keralas success has been simple, prioritized testing, widespread contact tracing, and promoting social distance. They also imposed uncompromising controls, that were supported by an excellent healthcare system, government accountability, transparency, public trust, civil rights and importantly the decentralized governance and strong grass-root level institutions. The proactive measures taken by Kerala such as early detection of cases and extensive social support measures can be a model for India and the world.

We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Methods: The performance of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was assessed at Roche Diagnostics (Penzberg, Germany). Sensitivity was evaluated using anonymised residual frozen samples from patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); one or more consecutive samples were collected from patients at various timepoints after PCR confirmation. Specificity was evaluated using anonymised unselected residual frozen samples from routine diagnostic testing or from blood donors; all samples were collected before December 2019 and thus deemed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Cross-reactivity was evaluated using anonymised frozen samples containing a wide range of potentially cross-reacting analytes, which were purchased from commercial vendors. For sensitivity and specificity, point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 496 samples from 102 patients with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99.5% (95% CI 97.0-100.0) at [&ge;]14 days after PCR confirmation. Overall specificity in 10,453 samples from routine diagnostic testing (n = 6305) and blood donors (n = 4148) was 99.80% (95% CI 99.69-99.88). Only 4\/752 samples containing potential cross-reacting analytes were reactive with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay, resulting in an overall specificity in this cohort of 99.5% (95% CI 98.6-99.9). Conclusion: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated a sensitivity of 99.5% at [&ge;]14 days after PCR confirmation and a very high specificity of 99.80%. Our findings support the use of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay as a tool for the identification of past SARS-CoV-2 infection, including in populations with a low disease prevalence.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Muench","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Simon Jochum","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Verena Wenderoth","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Beatus Ofenloch-Haehnle","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Hombach","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics International Ltd, Rotkreuz, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Matthias Strobl","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Henrik Sadlowski","author_inst":"Labor Berlin - Charite Vivantes Services GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christopher Sachse","author_inst":"KRH Labor GmbH, Hannover, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Riedel","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Beverland","author_inst":"Outcomes Assessment Unit, Musgrave Park Hospital, Stockmans Lane, Belfast, BT9 7JB, Northern Ireland"},{"author_name":"Brian D.

During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency, the gold standard for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosis is the detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Additional diagnostic methods enabling the detection of current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection would be highly beneficial to ensure the timely diagnosis of all infected and recovered patients. Here, we investigated several serological tools, i.e., two immunochromatographic lateral flow assays (LFA-1 (Biosynex COVID-19 BSS) and LFA-2 (COVID-19 Sign IgM\/IgG)) and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) detecting IgA (ELISA-1 Euroimmun), IgM (ELISA-2 EDI) and\/or IgG (ELISA-1 and ELISA-2) based on well-characterized panels of serum samples from patients and healthcare workers with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and from SARS-CoV-2-negative patients.

We propose a novel method that uses viral load data collected over time since hospitalization, hindcasting the timing of infection with a mathematical model for viral dynamics. As an example, we used the reported viral load data from multiple countries (Singapore, China, Germany, France, and Korea) and estimated the incubation period. The median, 2.5, and 97.5 percentiles of the incubation period were 5.23 days (95% CI: 5.17, 5.25), 3.29 days (3.25, 3.37), and 8.22 days (8.02, 8.46), respectively, which are comparable to the values estimated in previous studies.

The use of influential epidemiological models of COVID-19 helped to encourage decision makers to take drastic non-pharmaceutical interventions. Yet, inherent in these models are often assumptions that the active interventions are static, e.g., that social distancing is enforced until infections are minimized, which can lead to inaccurate predictions that are ever evolving as new data is assimilated. We present a methodology to dynamically guide the active intervention by shifting the focus from viewing epidemiological models as systems that evolve in autonomous fashion to control systems with an \"input\" that can be varied in time in order to change the evolution of the system. We show that a safety-critical control approach to COVID-19 mitigation gives active intervention policies that formally guarantee the safe evolution of compartmental epidemiological models. This perspective is applied to current US data on cases while taking into account reduction of mobility, and we find that it accurately describes the current trends when time delays associated with incubation and testing are incorporated. Optimal active intervention policies are synthesized to determine future mitigations necessary to bound infections, hospitalizations, and death, both at national and state levels. We therefore provide means in which to model and modulate active interventions with a view toward the phased reopenings that are currently beginning across the US and the world in a decentralized fashion. This framework can be converted into public policies, accounting for the fractured landscape of COVID-19 mitigation in a safety-critical fashion.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aaron D Ames","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tamas G Molnar","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Singletary","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Gabor Orosz","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Shoya Iwanami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Yasuhisa Fujita","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Ohashi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Koizumi","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine"},{"author_name":"Koichi Watashi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Nishiura","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20132639","rel_title":"Association of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, cancer, kidney disease, and high-cholesterol with COVID-19 disease severity and fatality: a systematic review","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20132639","rel_abs":"Objective: To undertake a review and critical appraisal of published\/preprint reports that offer methods of determining the effects of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, cancer, kidney issues, and high-cholesterol on COVID-19 disease severity.

Methods: A search was conducted by two authors independently on the freely available COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We developed an automated search engine to screen a total of 59,000 articles in a few seconds. The search engine was built using a retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each document regardless of their proximity within the document. Filtering of the articles was then undertaken using keywords and questions, e.g. \"Effects of diabetes on COVID\/normal coronavirus\/SARS-CoV-2\/nCoV\/COVID-19 disease severity, mortality?\". The search terms were repeated for all the comorbidities considered in this paper. Additional articles were retrieved by searching via Google Scholar and PubMed. Findings: A total of 54 articles were considered for a full review. It was observed that diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol levels possess an apparent relation to COVID-19 severity. Other comorbidities, such as cancer, kidney disease, and stroke, must be further evaluated to determine a strong relationship to the virus. Reports associating cancer, kidney disease, and stroke with COVID-19 should be carefully interpreted, not only because of the size of the samples, but also because patients could be old, have a history of smoking, or have any other clinical condition suggesting that these factors might be associated with the poor COVID-19 outcomes rather than the comorbidity itself. Such reports could lead many oncologists and physicians to change their treatment strategies without solid evidence and recommendations. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted. Additionally, treatment options must be examined further to provide optimal treatment and ensure better outcomes for patients suffering from these comorbidities.

Objective: To investigate whether state-imposed stay-at-home orders, African American population in the state, state poverty and other state socio-demographic characteristics, were associated with the state-level incidence of COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, Participants: State-level, aggregated, publicly available data on positive COVID-19 cases and tests were used. The period considered was March 1st -May 4th. All U.S. states except Washington were included. Outcomes of interest were daily cumulative and daily incremental COVID-19 infection rates. Outcomes were log-transformed. Log-linear regression models with a quadratic time-trend and random intercepts for states were estimated. Covariates included log-transformed test-rates, a binary indicator for stay-at-home, percentage of African American, poverty, percentage elderly, state population and prevalence of selected comorbidities. Binary fixed effects for date each state first started reporting test data were included. Results: Stay-at-home orders were associated with decreases in cumulative ({beta}:-1.23; T-stat: -6.84) and daily ({beta}:-0.46; T-stat: -2.56) infection-rates. Predictive analyses indicated that expected cumulative infection rates would be 3 times higher and expected daily incremental rates about 60% higher in absence of stay-at-home orders. Higher African American population was associated with higher cumulative ({beta}: 0.08; T-stat: 4.01) and daily ({beta}: 0.06; T-stat: 3.50) rates. State poverty rates had mixed results and were not robust to model specifications. There was strong evidence of a quadratic daily trend for cumulative and daily rates. Results were largely robust to alternate specifications. Conclusions: We find evidence that stay-at-home orders, which were widely supported by public-health experts, helped to substantially curb COVID-19 infection-rates. As we move to a phased re-opening, continued precautions advised by public-health experts should be adhered to. Also, a larger African American population is strongly associated with incidence of COVID-19 infection. Policies and resources to help mitigate African American vulnerability to COVID-19 is an urgent public health and social justice issue, especially since the ongoing mass protests against police brutality may further exacerbate COVID-19 contagion in this community.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bisakha P Sen","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sangeetha Padalabalanarayanan","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Vidya Sagar Hanumanthu","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Gabor Orosz","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Shoya Iwanami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Yasuhisa Fujita","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Ohashi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Koizumi","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine"},{"author_name":"Koichi Watashi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Nishiura","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20132563","rel_title":"A Counterfactual Graphical Model Reveals Economic and Sociodemographic Variables as Key Determinants of Country-Wise COVID-19 Burden","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20132563","rel_abs":"Importance: Insights into the country-wise differences in COVID-19 burden can impact the policies being developed to control disease spread. Objective: Present study evaluated the possible socio-economic and health related factors (and their temporal consistency) determining the disease burden of COVID-19. Design: A retrospective analysis for identifying associations of COVID-19 burden. Setting: Data on COVID-19 statistics (number of cases, tests and deaths per million) was extracted from the website https:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/coronavirus\/ on 10th April and 12th May. Variables obtained to estimate the possible determinants for COVID-19 burden included economic- gross domestic product; socio-demographic- Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs indicators related to health systems, percentage Chinese diaspora; and COVID-19 trajectory- date of first case in each country, days between first reported case and 10th April, days between 100th and 1000th case, and government response stringency index (GRSI). Main outcomes and Measures: COVID-19 burden was modeled using economic and socio-demographic determinants. Consistency of inferences for two time points at three levels of increasing statistical rigor using (i) Spearman correlations, (ii) Bayesian probabilistic graphical model, and (iii) counterfactual impact was evaluated. Results: Countries economy (reflected by GDP), mainly through the testing rates, was the major and temporally consistent determinant of COVID-19 burden in the model. Reproduction number of COVID-19 was lower where mortality due to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) was higher, thus strengthening the hygiene hypothesis. There was no association between vaccination status or tuberculosis incidence and COVID burden, refuting the claims over BCG vaccination as a possible factor against COVID-19 trajectory. Conclusion and Relevance: Countries economy, through testing power, was the major determinant of COVID-19 burden. There was weak evidence for hygiene hypothesis as a protective factor against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Kedia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Raghav Awasthi","author_inst":"IIIT D"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Lodha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Vineet Ahuja","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yasuhisa Fujita","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Ohashi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Koizumi","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine"},{"author_name":"Koichi Watashi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Nishiura","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20132423","rel_title":"Seroprevalence and epidemiological characteristics of immunoglobulin M and G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20132423","rel_abs":"Background: The seroprevalence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be a more reliable approach to detect true infected population, particularly in asymptomatic persons. The seroprevalence of IgG or IgM in people in general has not been well described. We choose a general hospital in Jianghan District in Wuhan, near the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, to conduct a serological survey, aimed at assessing asymptomatic infections of COVID-19 compared to epidemiological characteristics of people in Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a serological survey of asymptomatic people who were tested in the general hospital using a validated colloidal gold method for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data and CT imaging findings from March 25 to April 28, 2020 were collected and compared. A total of 18,712 people mainly met the inclusion criteria to be enrolled (89.4%), with a median age of 40 years (range 4-81 years old), including 11,391 males (60.9%) with a median age of 42 years and 7,321 females (39.1%) with a median age of 37 years. The seroprevalence was estimated adjusting for imperfect diagnostic tests and the demographic structure of the population. Results: During the period from 25 March 2020 to 28 April 2020, the seroprevalence of IgG and IgM standardized for age and sex in Wuhan varied between 7.67% and 1.56% for IgG, and between 0.71% and 0.16% for IgM, and showed a downward trend. No significant correlation was observed between the seroprevalence of IgG and the different age groups, although none of the 26 individuals under the age of 19 years tested positive for IgG. The seroprevalence of IgM in different age groups was correlated with age (x2 = 18.496, p= 0.035), with no IgM positivity detected under the age of 24 years old (n = 679). Accounting for test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of the general population, the seroprevalence of IgG and \/or IgM was estimated at 2.72% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.49-2.95%), with a seroprevalence of 2.05% (1.79-2.31%) for males and 3.41% (2.99-3.83%) for females. The seroprevalence was significantly higher for females than males (x2 = 35.702, p < 0.001), with an odds ratio of 1.36 (95% CI: 1.24-1.48). Based on the census number of the Wuhan population aged 4-81 years old in 2017, using IgG and\/or IgM seroprevalence tests, the number of asymptomatic COVID-19-positive individuals aged 4-81 years old was estimated at 217,332 (95% CI: 198,709-235,955) in Wuhan from March 25 to April 28, 2020. A significant difference was seen in the seroprevalence of IgG among people from different geographic areas and different types of workplaces (respectively, x2 = 42.871, p < 0.001 and x2 = 202.43, p < 0.001). Sixty percent of antibody-positive cases came from the top ten work units out of a total of 154 units. Some professions had a higher risk for positive antibody tests. From CT imaging of 1636 participants, the IgG antibody-positive cases had a greater number of abnormalities in CT imaging than IgG-negative cases (30.7% vs 19.7%). Significant differences were seen between test groups of antibody-positive and negative cases of IgG and \/or IgM in the percentage of leucocytes, neutrophilic granulocytes and monocytes. Conclusions: The reported number of confirmed patients in Wuhan only represents a small proportion of the total number of infections, and most of the Wuhan population remains susceptible to COVID-19. There were differences in IgG seroprevalence among geographic areas, which were consistent with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in Wuhan. There was a significant aggregation of asymptomatic infections in individuals from some occupations, and based on CT and laboratory findings, some damage may have occurred in asymptomatic individuals positive for IgG antibody.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruijie Ling","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese & Western Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Yihan Yu","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese & Western Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Jiayu He","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jixian Zhang","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese & Western Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sha Xu","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese & Western Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Renrong Sun","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese & Western Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Wangcai Zhu","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese & Western Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Mingfeng Chen","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Li","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Honglong Ji","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Centre at Tyler, Tyler, Texas, USA"},{"author_name":"Huanqiang Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poisons Control,Chinese CDC"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20133207","rel_title":"Downsides of face masks and possible mitigation strategies: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20133207","rel_abs":"Objective To identify, appraise, and synthesise studies evaluating the downsides of wearing facemasks in any setting. We also discuss potential strategies to mitigate these downsides. Methods PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, EuropePMC were searched (inception-18\/5\/2020), and clinical registries were searched via CENTRAL. We also did forward-backward citation search of the included studies. We included randomised controlled trials and observational studies comparing facemask use to any active intervention or to control. Two author pairs independently screened articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. The primary outcomes were compliance, discomforts, harms, and adverse events of wearing facemasks. Findings We screened 5471 articles, including 37 (40 references); 11 were meta-analysed. For mask wear adherence, 47% more people wore facemasks in the facemask group compared to control; adherence was significantly higher (26%) in the surgical\/medical mask group than in N95\/P2 group. The largest number of studies reported on the discomfort and irritation outcome (20-studies); fewest reported on the misuse of masks, and none reported on mask contamination or risk compensation behaviour. Risk of bias was generally high for blinding of participants and personnel and low for attrition and reporting biases. Conclusion There are insufficient data to quantify all of the adverse effects that might reduce the acceptability, adherence, and effectiveness of face masks. New research on facemasks should assess and report the harms and downsides. Urgent research is also needed on methods and designs to mitigate the downsides of facemask wearing, particularly the assessment of alternatives such as face shields.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mina Bakhit","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Natalia Krzyzaniak","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Anna Mae Scott","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Justin Clark","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Wangcai Zhu","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese & Western Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Mingfeng Chen","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Li","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Honglong Ji","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Centre at Tyler, Tyler, Texas, USA"},{"author_name":"Huanqiang Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poisons Control,Chinese CDC"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20134114","rel_title":"Prevalence, specificity, and clinical association of anti-phospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 patients: are the antibodies really guilty?","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20134114","rel_abs":"Background. Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a profound hypercoagulable state and often develop coagulopathy which leads to organ failure and death. Because of a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT), a relationship with anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) has been proposed, but results are controversial. Functional assays for aPL (i.e., lupus anticoagulant) can be influenced by concomitant anticoagulation and\/or high levels of C reactive protein. The presence of anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-{beta}2GPI) and anti-phosphatidylserine\/prothrombin (aPS\/PT) antibodies was not investigated systematically. Epitope specificity of anti-{beta}2GPI antibodies was not reported. Objective. To evaluate the prevalence and the clinical association of aPL in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients, and to characterize the epitope specificity of anti-{beta}2GPI antibodies. Methods. ELISA and chemiluminescence assays were used to test 122 sera of patients suffering from severe COVID-19. Of them, 16 displayed major thrombotic events. Results. Anti-{beta}2GPI IgG\/IgA\/IgM were the most frequent in 15.6\/6.6\/9.0% of patients, while aCL IgG\/IgM were detected in 5.7\/6.6% by ELISA. Comparable values were found by chemiluminescence. aPS\/PT IgG\/IgM were detectable in 2.5 and 9.8% by ELISA. No association between thrombosis and aPL was found. Reactivity against domain 1 and 4-5 of {beta}2GPI was limited to 3\/58 (5.2%) tested sera for each domain and did not correlate with aCL\/anti-{beta}2GPI nor with thrombosis. Conclusions. aPL show a low prevalence in COVID-19 patients and are not associated with major thrombotic events. aPL in COVID-19 patients are mainly directed against {beta}2GPI but display an epitope specificity different from antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Orietta Borghi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano - Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Asmaa Beltagy","author_inst":"Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Emirena Garrafa","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Curreli","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Germana Cecchini","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Department of Chemical Chemistry, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Bodio","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Grossi","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simonetta Blengino","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Department of Cardiovascular, Neural and Metabolic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Angela Tincani","author_inst":"Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Dep.

A special interest of simulations on the pandemic is to trace the effect of politics for reducing the virus spread, since these measures have had an enormous impact on economy and daily life. Here a simple yet powerful algorithm is introduced for fitting the infection numbers by simple analytic functions. This way, the increase of the case numbers in periods with different regulations can be distinguished, and by extrapolating the fit functions, a forecast for the maximum numbers and time scales are possible. The effect of the restraints such as lock down are demonstrated by comparing the resulting infection history with the likely unconstrained virus spread, and it is shown that a delay of 1-4 weeks before imposing measures aiming at social distancing could have led to a complete infection of the respective populations. The approach is simply transferable to many different states. Here data from six E.U. countries, the UK, Russia, two Asian countries, the USA and ten states inside the USA with significant case numbers are analyzed, and striking qualitative similarities are found.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Walter Langel","author_inst":"University of Greifswald"},{"author_name":"Asmaa Beltagy","author_inst":"Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Emirena Garrafa","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Curreli","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Germana Cecchini","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Department of Chemical Chemistry, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Bodio","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Grossi","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simonetta Blengino","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Department of Cardiovascular, Neural and Metabolic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Angela Tincani","author_inst":"Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Dep.

Most COVID-19 cases published were in the third trimester of pregnancy, which could reflect reporting bias, higher risk of infection or increased disease severity in late pregnancy. Seroprevalence studies may allow reliable estimates of the susceptibility to infection and clinical spectrum since they include asymptomatic and mild infections not tested for PCR. We evaluated the seroprevalence and clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnant women in the first and third trimester. Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each institution and informed consent was obtained. We recruited 874 consecutive pregnancies attending for first trimester screening (10-16 weeks of gestation, n=372) or delivery (n=502) from April 14 to May 5. All women were interviewed with a structured questionnaire for COVID-19 symptoms two months prior to sampling. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM\/IgA antibodies were tested (COVID-19 VIRCLIA Monotest, Vircell Microbiologist, Spain; reported sensitivity 70% IgG and 89% IgM\/IgA, and specificity 89% and 99% respectively). Indeterminate results were re-tested (VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV2 Total Tests, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, USA; 100% sensitivity and specificity) and re-classified as positive or negative. Women with COVID-19 were diagnosed and managed according to standard protocols and guidelines3,4. Statistical differences were tested using the {chi}2 test or Student t-test as appropriate (p<0.05). Results: A total of 125 of 874 women (14.3%) were positive for either IgG or IgM\/IgA SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 54\/372 (14.5%) in the first and 71\/502 (14.1%) in the third trimester. A total of 75\/125 (60%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the past 2 months, whereas 44 (35.2%) reported one or more symptoms, of which 31 (24.8%) had at least 3 symptoms or anosmia and 8 (6.4%) dyspnea. Overall, 7 women (5.6%) were admitted for persistent fever despite paracetamol and dyspnea, of which 3 had signs of pneumonia on chest radiography. All 3 had criteria for severity (bilateral chest condensation, respiratory rate>30 and leukopenia) and required oxygen support but not critical care or mechanical ventilation, and they were all discharged well. The rates of symptomatic infection, hospital admission or dyspnea were significantly higher in third trimester women (Table and Figure). Discussion: The 14.3% seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 in pregnant women in this study was substantially larger than the contemporary rates of PCR positive cases (0.78%) reported for women 20-40y in Barcelona. The data confirm that COVID-19 is asymptomatic in the majority of pregnant women6 and illustrate the value of seroprevalence studies to capture the high proportion of asymptomatic or mild infections. In this study, none of the 125 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection required critical care as compared to 9% reported in cases diagnosed with PCR. However, the proportion of infections with symptoms or dyspnea was remarkably higher in the third trimester, and these results are in line with COVID-19 registries, reporting that 81% of hospitalized women were in late pregnancy or peripartum. These results provide reassuring information that, even in settings with a high prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy mostly presents with asymptomatic or mild clinical forms. The susceptibility to infection seemed to be the same in the first and the third trimesters of gestation. The data further suggest that, as with other respiratory viruses, COVID-19 could be more severe and require increased surveillance in late pregnancy. These findings should be confirmed and extended with larger consecutive prevalence studies in pregnancy.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Crovetto","author_inst":"BCNatal - Barcelona Center for Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Sant Joan de Deu and Hospital Clinic), Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Deu, IDIBA"},{"author_name":"Fatima Crispi","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Sant Joan de Deu), IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Elisa Llurba","author_inst":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department, Sant Pau University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Francesc Figueras","author_inst":"BCNatal - Barcelona Center for Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Sant Joan de Deu and Hospital Clinic), IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERER,"},{"author_name":"Maria Dolores Gomez-Roig","author_inst":"BCNatal - Barcelona Center for Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Sant Joan de Deu and Hospital Clinic), Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Deu, Unive"},{"author_name":"Eduard Gratacos","author_inst":"BCNatal - Barcelona Center for Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Sant Joan de Deu and Hospital Clinic), Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Deu, IDIBA"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Schwab","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Maurice Henkel","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Angela Frank","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Veronika Zsikla","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Niels Willi","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Werner Kempf","author_inst":"Kempf und Pfaltz Histologische Diagnostik, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hoyler","author_inst":"Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mattia Barbareschi","author_inst":"Anatomia ed Istologia Patologica, Ospedale S.

Olfactory impairment is now a recognized symptom of COVID-19 and is rapidly becoming one of the most reliable indicators of the disease. We compared olfaction data from asymptomatic students, who were assessed as SARS-CoV-2 was unknowingly spreading locally, to students tested prior to the arrival of the virus. This study was naturalistic by design as testing occurred in the context of four research studies, all of which used the same inclusion\/exclusion criteria and the same protocol to objectively assess odor detection, identification, and hedonics with physiological tests. Data from students (Cohort II; N=22) with probable SARS-CoV-2 exposure were compared to students tested just prior to local virus transmission (Cohort I; N=25), and a normative sample of students assessed over the previous four years (N=272). Students in Cohort II demonstrated significantly reduced odor detection sensitivity compared to students in Cohort I (t=2.60; P=.01; d=0.77; CI, 0.17, 1.36), with a distribution skewed towards reduced detection sensitivity (D=0.38; P=.005). Categorically, the exposed group was significantly more likely to have hyposmia (OR=7.74; CI, 3.1, 19.40), particularly the subgroup assessed in the final week before campus closure (OR=13.61; CI, 3.40, 35.66;). The exposed cohort also rated odors as less unpleasant (P<.001, CLES=0.77). A limitation of our study is that participants were not tested for COVID-19 as testing was unavailable in the area. Objective measures of olfaction may detect olfactory impairment in asymptomatic persons who are otherwise unaware of smell loss. The development of cost-effective, objective olfaction tests that could be self-administered regularly could aid in early detection of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, which is vital to combating this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julie Walsh-Messinger","author_inst":"University of Dayton"},{"author_name":"Sahar Kaouk","author_inst":"University of Dayton"},{"author_name":"Hannah Manis","author_inst":"University of Dayton"},{"author_name":"Rachel Kaye","author_inst":"Rutgers New Jersey Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Cecchi","author_inst":"Thomas J.
