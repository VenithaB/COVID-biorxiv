Interim clinical trial results suggest that the corticosteroid dexamethasone displays superior 28-day survival in severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation or oxygen. Among 16 patients with plasma IL-6 measurement post-corticosteroid administration, a higher proportion of patients with an IL-6 value over 10 pg\/mL have worse outcomes (i.e. ICU Length of Stay > 15 days or death) when compared to 41 patients treated with non-corticosteroid drugs including antivirals, tocilizumab, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine (p-value = 0.0024). Given this unexpected clinical association between post-corticosteroid IL-6 levels and COVID-19 severity, we hypothesized that the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR or NR3C1) may be coupled to IL-6 expression in specific cell types that govern cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Examining single cell RNA-seq data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of severe COVID-19 patients and nearly 2 million human cells from a pan-tissue scan shows that alveolar macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells co-express both NR3C1 and IL-6. The mechanism of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) agonists mitigating pulmonary and multi-organ inflammation in some COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, may be in part due to their successful antagonism of IL-6 production within lung macrophages and vasculature.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samir Awasthi","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Arjun Puranik","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hurchik","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Vineet Agarwal","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ian Conrad","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Christian Kirkup","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Raman Arunachalam","author_inst":"nference Labs"},{"author_name":"John O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Walter Kremers","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kashyap","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Platform"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William A Faubion","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20144717","rel_title":"Association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers use and the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.","rel_date":"2020-07-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20144717","rel_abs":"Background The effect of using Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) on the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a topic of recent debate. Although studies have examined the potential association between them, the results remain controversial. This study aims to determine the true effect of ACEI\/ARBs use on the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Methods Five electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, medRxiv preprint server) were retrieved to find eligible studies. Meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between ACEI\/ARBs use and the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Results 22 articles containing 157,328 patients were included. Use of ACEI\/ARBs was not associated with increased risk of infection (Adjusted OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.01, I2=5.8%) or increased severity (Adjusted OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.05, I2=27.6%) of COVID-19. The use of ACEI\/ARBs was associated with lower risk of death from COVID-19 (Adjusted OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44-0.99, I2=57.9%). Similar results of reduced risk of death were also found for ACEI\/ARB use in COVID-19 patients with hypertension (Adjusted OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.17-0.77, I2=0). Conclusion This study provides evidence that ACEI\/ARBs use for COVID-19 patients does not lead to harmful outcomes and may even provide a beneficial role and decrease mortality from COVID-19. Clinicians should not discontinue ACEI\/ARBs for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 if they are already on these agents.

The extent and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is far greater than previous coronaviruses that emerged in the 21st Century. Here, we modeled stability of SARS-CoV-2 on skin, paper currency, and clothing to determine if these surfaces may factor in the fomite transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Skin, currency, and clothing samples were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 under laboratory conditions and incubated at three different temperatures (4C, 22C, and 37C). Stability was evaluated at 0 hours (h), 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 72 h, 96 h, 7 days, and 14 days post-exposure. SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be stable on skin through the duration of the experiment at 4C (14 days). Virus remained stable on skin for at least 96 h at 22C and for at least 8h at 37C. There were minimal differences between the tested currency samples. The virus remained stable on the $1 U.S.A. Bank Note for at least 96 h at 4C while viable virus was not detected on the $20 U.S.A. Bank Note samples beyond 72 h. The virus remained stable on both Bank Notes for at least 8 h at 22C and 4 h at 37C. Clothing samples were similar in stability to the currency with the virus being detected for at least 96 h at 4C and at least 4 h at 22C. No viable virus was detected on clothing samples at 37C after initial exposure. This study confirms the inverse relationship between virus stability and temperature. Furthermore, virus stability on skin demonstrates the need for continued hand hygiene practices to minimize fomite transmission both in the general population as well as workplaces where close contact is common.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Harbourt","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Andrew Haddow","author_inst":"General Dynamics Health Solutions in support of USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Ashley Piper","author_inst":"Oak Ridge Institute of Science and Education"},{"author_name":"Holly Bloomfield","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Brian Kearney","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Gibson","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Tim Minogue","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Hongru Yang","author_inst":"Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Science"},{"author_name":"Zhichun Guo","author_inst":"Massachusetts college of Pharmacy and Health sciences"},{"author_name":"Mengshi Chen","author_inst":"Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chenyu Sun","author_inst":"AMITA Health Saint Joseph Hospital Chicago"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kashyap","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Platform"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William A Faubion","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20145102","rel_title":"Methodological Rigor in COVID-19 Clinical Research: A Systematic Review and Case-Control Analysis","rel_date":"2020-07-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20145102","rel_abs":"Objective: To systematically evaluate the quality of reporting of currently available COVID-19 studies compared to historical controls. Design: A systematic review and case-control analysis Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until May 14, 2020 Study selection: All original clinical literature evaluating COVID-19 or SARS-CoV2 were identified and 1:1 historical control of the same study type in the same published journal was matched from the previous year Data extraction: Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-texts and independently assessed methodological quality using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, QUADAS-2 Score, or case series checklist. Results: 9895 titles and abstracts were screened and 686 COVID-19 articles were included in the final analysis in which 380 (55.4%) were case series, 199 (29.0%) were cohort, 63 (9.2%) were diagnostic, 38 (5.5%) were case-control, and 6 (0.9%) were randomized controlled trials. Overall, high quality\/low-bias studies represented less than half of COVID-19 articles - 49.0% of case series, 43.9% of cohort, 31.6% of case-control, and 6.4% of diagnostic studies. We matched 539 control articles to COVID-19 articles from the same journal in the previous year for a final analysis of 1078 articles. The median time to acceptance was 13.0 (IQR, 5.0-25.0) days in COVID-19 articles vs. 110.0 (IQR, 71.0-156.0) days in control articles (p<0.0001). Overall, methodological quality was lower in COVID-19 articles with 220 COVID-19 articles of high quality (41.0%) vs. 392 control articles (73.3%, p<0.0001) with similar results when stratified by study design. In both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression, COVID-19 articles were associated with lower methodological quality (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.33, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Currently published COVID-19 studies were accepted more quickly and were found to be of lower methodological quality than comparative studies published in the same journal. Given the implications of these studies to medical decision making and government policy, greater effort to appropriately weigh the existing evidence in the context of emerging high-quality research is needed.

We investigated whether blood biomarkers measured by high-throughput metabolomics could be predictive of severe pneumonia and COVID-19 hospitalisation years after the blood sampling. Methods: Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics was used to quantify a comprehensive biomarker profile in 105,146 plasma samples collected in the UK Biobank during 2007-2010 (age range 39-70). The biomarkers were tested for association with severe pneumonia (2507 cases, defined as diagnosis in hospital or death record occurring during a median of 8.1-year follow-up) and with severe COVID-19 (195 cases, defined as diagnosis in hospital between mid-March to mid-June 2020). A multi-biomarker score was derived for prediction of severe pneumonia based on half of the study population and validated in the other half. We explored how this biomarker score relates to the risk of severe COVID-19. Findings: The biomarker associations with risk of severe COVID-19 followed an overall pattern similar to associations with risk of severe pneumonia (correlation 0.83). The multi-biomarker score, comprised of 25 blood biomarkers including inflammatory proteins, fatty acids, amino acids and advanced lipid measures, was strongly associated with risk of severe pneumonia (odds ratio 1.67 per standard deviation [95% confidence interval 1.59-1.76]; 3.8-fold risk increase for individuals in upper vs lower quintile). The multi-biomarker score was also associated with risk of severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 1.33 [1.17-1.53]; 2.5-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile) and remained significant when adjusting for body mass index, smoking, and existing respiratory and cardiometabolic diseases. Mimicking the decade lag from blood sampling to COVID-19, severe pneumonia events occurring after 7-11 years associated with the multi-biomarker score to a similar magnitude (odds ratio 1.43 [1.29-1.59]; 2.6-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile) as for severe COVID-19. However, the short-term risk of severe pneumonia events associated to the multi-biomarker score at even 3 times higher magnitude (odds ratio 2.21 [1.95-2.50]; 8.0-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile in analysis of the first 2 years after blood sampling). Interpretation: In decade-old blood samples from the UK Biobank, a biomarker score measured by high-throughput metabolomics is indicative of the risk for severe COVID-19. The molecular signature of biomarker changes reflective of risk for severe COVID-19 is similar to that for severe pneumonia, in particular when accounting for the time lag to the COVID-19 pandemic. The even stronger association of the biomarker score with 2-year risk for severe pneumonia lends support to promising screening possibilities for identifying people at high risk for severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- Nightingale Health UK Biobank Initiative","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Julkunen","author_inst":"Nightingale Health Ltd."},{"author_name":"Anna Cichonska","author_inst":"Nightingale Health Ltd."},{"author_name":"P Eline Slagboom","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter W\u00fcrtz","author_inst":"Nightingale Health Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jonas Chnaiderman","author_inst":"Laboratory of Environmental Virology, Virology Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Rojas","author_inst":"Laboratory of Environmental Virology, Virology Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Sergio Guajardo-Leiva","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Diez","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective descriptive and trend analysis of all ED visits in Marin County, California from January 1, 2018 to May 4, 2020 to quantify the temporal dynamics of ED utilization before and after the March 17, 2020 SIP order. Results: The average number of ED visits per day decreased by 52.3% following the SIP order compared to corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019. Both respiratory and non-respiratory visits declined, but this negative trend was most pronounced for non-respiratory admissions. Conclusions: The first SIP order to be issued in the United States in response to COVID-19 was associated with a significant reduction in ED utilization in Marin County.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brett R.

Hospitals become rapidly overwhelmed when patients requiring life-saving support outpace available capacities. We here describe methods used by a university hospital to forecast caseloads and time to peak incidence. Methods We developed a set of models to forecast incidence among the hospital catchment population and describe the COVID-19 patient hospital care-path. The first forecast utilized data from antecedent allopatric epidemics and parameterized the care path model according to expert opinion (static model). Once sufficient local data were available, trends for the time dependent effective reproduction number were fitted and the care-path was parameterized using hazards for real patient admission, referrals, and discharge (dynamic model). Results The static model, deployed before the epidemic, exaggerated the bed occupancy (general wards 116 forecasted vs 66 observed, ICU 47 forecasted vs 34 observed) and predicted the peak too late (general ward forecast April 9, observed April 8, ICU forecast April 19, observed April 8). After April 5, the dynamic model could be run daily and precision improved with increasing availability of empirical local data. Conclusions The models provided data-based guidance in the preparation and allocation of critical resources of a university hospital well in advance of the epidemic surge, despite overestimating the service demand. Overestimates should resolve when population contact pattern before and during restrictions can be taken into account, but for now they may provide an acceptable safety margin for preparing during times of uncertainty.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tjibbe Donker","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Fabian B\u00fcrkin","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Martin Wolkewitz","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Christian Haverkamp","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Dominic Christoffel","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Oliver Kappert","author_inst":"Public Health Office, Public Health District Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Thorsten Hammer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Hans-J\u00f6rg Busch","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Johannes Kalbhenn","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Hartmut B\u00fcrkle","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Winfried Kern","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Frederik Wenz","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Hajo Grundmann","author_inst":"UniversityMedical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William A Faubion","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.30.20143149","rel_title":"Orthogonal Functions for Evaluating Social Distancing Impact on CoVID-19 Spread","rel_date":"2020-07-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.30.20143149","rel_abs":"Early CoVID-19 growth often obeys: N{t}=N\/I\\exp[+K\/o\\t], with K\/o\\=[(ln2)\/(t\/dbl\\)], where t\/dbl\\ is the pandemic doubling time, prior to society-wide Social Distancing.

Additional parameters besides {K\/o\\,gamma\/o\\} are needed to better model different rho[t]=dN[t]\/dt shapes.

The bing.com USA CoVID-19 data was analyzed using M\/F\\=(0,1,2) in the OFM. All results agreed to within about 10 percent, showing model robustness.

Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be significantly higher than RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that ddPCR could be used as a highly sensitive and compatible diagnostic method for viral RNA detection.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Changwoo Park","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Jina Lee","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Zohaib Ul Hassan","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Keun Bon Ku","author_inst":"KRICT"},{"author_name":"Seong Jun Kim","author_inst":"KRICT"},{"author_name":"Hong Gi Kim","author_inst":"KRICT"},{"author_name":"Edmond Changkyun Park","author_inst":"KBSi"},{"author_name":"Gun-Soo Park","author_inst":"KFRI"},{"author_name":"Daeui Park","author_inst":"KIT"},{"author_name":"Seung-Hwa Baek","author_inst":"KIT"},{"author_name":"Dongju Park","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Jihye Lee","author_inst":"IPK"},{"author_name":"Sangeun Jeon","author_inst":"IPK"},{"author_name":"Seungtaek Kim","author_inst":"IPK"},{"author_name":"Chang-Seop Lee","author_inst":"JBNU"},{"author_name":"Hee Min Yoo","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Seil Kim","author_inst":"KRISS"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.186825","rel_title":"Map of SARS-CoV-2 spike epitopes not shielded by glycans.","rel_date":"2020-07-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.186825","rel_abs":"The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, calls for the urgent development of a vaccine. The primary immunological target is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S is exposed on the viral surface to mediate viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible antibody binding sites not shielded by glycans, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for vaccine development. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics in epitope mapping.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mateusz Sikora","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute of Biophysics"},{"author_name":"S\u00f6ren von B\u00fclow","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute of Biophysics"},{"author_name":"Florian E.

Recently, CRISPR-based diagnostics have emerged as attractive alternatives to quantitative real-time PCR due to their faster turnaround time and their potential to be used in point-of-care testing scenarios. However, existing CRISPR-based assays for COVID-19 have not considered viral genome mutations and RNA editing in human cells. Here, we present the VaNGuard (Variant Nucleotide Guard) test that is not only specific and sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, but can also detect the virus when its genome or transcriptome has evolved or has been edited by deaminases in infected human cells. We show that an engineered AsCas12a enzyme is more tolerant of mismatches than wildtype LbCas12a and that multiplexed Cas12a targeting can overcome the presence of single nucleotide variations.

We established a translational approach combining home blood sampling by finger-pricking with multiplexed serology to assess the exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a general population. The developed procedure determines the immune response in multiplexed assays against several spike (S, here denoted SPK), receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (NCP) proteins in eluates from dried capillary blood. The seroprevalence was then determined in two study sets by mailing 1000 blood sampling kits to random households in urban Stockholm during early and late April 2020, respectively. After receiving 55% (1097\/2000) of the cards back within three weeks, 80% (878\/1097) were suitable for the analyses of IgG and IgM titers. The data revealed diverse pattern of immune response, thus seroprevalence was dependent on the antigen, immunoglobulin class, stringency to include different antigens, as well as the required analytical performance. Applying unsupervised dimensionality reduction to the combined IgG and IgM data, 4.4% (19\/435; 95% CI: 2.4%-6.3%) and 6.3% (28\/443; 95% CI: 4.1%-8.6%) of the samples clustered with convalescent controls. Using overlapping scores from at least two SPK antigens, prevalence rates reached 10.1% (44\/435; 95% CI: 7.3%-12.9%) in study set 1 and 10.8% (48\/443; 95% CI: 7.9%-13.7%). Measuring the immune response against several SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a multiplexed workflow can provide valuable insights about the serological diversity and improve the certainty of the classification. Combining such assays with home-sampling of blood presents a viable strategy for individual-level diagnostics and towards an unbiased assessment of the seroprevalence in a population and may serve to improve our understanding about the diversity of COVID-19 etiology.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niclas Roxhed","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Annika Bendes","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Matilda Dale","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Mattsson","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Leo Hanke","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tea Dodig-Crnkovic","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Murray Christian","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Birthe Meineke","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Simon Elsasser","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Juni Andrell","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Haverall","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thalin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Carina Eklund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Joakim Dillner","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Olof Beck","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Cecilia E Thomas","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Mun-Gwan Hong","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Claudia Fredolini","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jochen M Schwenk","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20143925","rel_title":"Evolution of COVID-19 Pandemic in India","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20143925","rel_abs":"A mathematical analysis of patterns for the evolution of COVID-19 cases is key to the development of reliable and robust predictive models potentially leading to efficient and effective governance against COVID-19.

Delhi has reached {surd}t phase and may flatten in the coming days. However, some states have deviated from the universal pattern of the epidemic curve. Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan show a gradual rise in the power-law regime, which is not the usual trend. Also, Bihar, Karnataka, and Kerala are exhibiting a second wave. In addition, we report that initially, the death counts show similar behavior as the infection counts. Later, however, the death growth rate declines as compared to the infection growth due to better handling of critical cases and increased immunity of the population. These observations indicate that except Delhi, most of the Indian states are far from flattening their epidemic curves.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali Asad","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur"},{"author_name":"Siddharth Srivastava","author_inst":"Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Noida"},{"author_name":"Mahendra K.

The rising COVID-19 pandemic caused many governments to impose policies restricting social interactions. These policies have slowed down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the extent that restric- tions can be gradually lifted. Models can be useful to assess the consequences of deconfinement strategies with respect to business, school and leisure activities. Methods. We adapted the individual-based model \"STRIDE\" to simulate interactions between the 11 million inhabitants of Belgium at the levels of households, workplaces, schools and communities. We calibrated our model to observed hospital incidence and seroprevalence data. STRIDE can explore contact tracing options and account for repetitive leisure contacts in extended household settings (so called \"household bubbles\") with varying levels of connectivity. Findings. Household bubbles have the potential to reduce the number of COVID-19 hospital admissions by up to 90%. The effectiveness of contact tracing depends on its timing, as it becomes futile more than 4 days after the index case developed symptoms. Assuming that children have a lower level of susceptibility and lower probability to experience symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, (partial) school closure options have relatively little impact on COVID-19 burden. Interpretation. Not only the absolute number and intensity of physical contacts drive the transmission dynamics and COVID-19 burden, also their repetitiveness is influential. Contact tracing seems essential for a controlled and persistent release of lockdown measures, but requires timely compliance to testing, reporting and self-isolation. Rapid tracing and testing, and communication ensuring continued involvement of the population are therefore essential.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lander Willem","author_inst":"CHERMID, University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Steven Abrams","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Oana Petrof","author_inst":"Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"Pietro Coletti","author_inst":"Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"Elise Kuylen","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Pieter Libin","author_inst":"Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"Signe Mogelmose","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"James Wambua","author_inst":"Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"Sereina A Herzog","author_inst":"University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Christel Faes","author_inst":"Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"- SIMID COVID19 team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Philippe Beutels","author_inst":"University of Antwerp and University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Joakim Dillner","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Olof Beck","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Cecilia E Thomas","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Mun-Gwan Hong","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Claudia Fredolini","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jochen M Schwenk","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144295","rel_title":"Sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific-antibodies in dried blood spot samples","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144295","rel_abs":"Abstract Importance: Population-wide serological testing is an essential component in understanding the COVID-19 pandemic. The logistical challenges of undertaking widespread serological testing could be eased through use of a reliable dried blood spot (DBS) sampling method. Objective: To validate the use of dried blood spot sampling for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Design, setting and participants: Eighty-seven matched DBS and serum samples were obtained from eighty individuals, including thirty-one who were previously PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. DBS eluates and sera were used in an ELISA to detect antibodies to the viral spike protein. Results: Specific anti-SARS-Cov-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies were detectable in both serum and DBS eluate and there was a significant correlation between the antibody levels detected in matched samples (r = 0.96, p<0.0001). Using serum as the gold standard in the assay, matched DBS samples achieved a Cohens kappa coefficient of 0.975 (near-perfect agreement), a sensitivity of 98.1% and specificity of 100%, for detecting anti-spike glycoprotein antibodies. Conclusions and relevance: Eluates from DBS samples are a reliable and reproducible source of antibodies to be used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The use of DBS sampling could complement the use of venepuncture in the immunosurveillance of COVID-19 in both low and high income settings.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriella L Morley","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Stephen Taylor","author_inst":"Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, U.K."},{"author_name":"Sian Jossi","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Marisol Perez-Toledo","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Sian E Faustini","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Edith Marcial-Juarez","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Adrian M Shields","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Margaret Goodall","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Joel D Allen","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, U.K."},{"author_name":"Yasunori Watanabe","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, U.K."},{"author_name":"Maddy L Newby","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, U.K."},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, U.K."},{"author_name":"Mark T Drayson","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Adam F Cunningham","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Alex G Richter","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Matthew K O'Shea","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Mun-Gwan Hong","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Claudia Fredolini","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jochen M Schwenk","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144436","rel_title":"Injury-Prone: Peripheral nerve injuries associated with prone positioning for COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144436","rel_abs":"Patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require invasive mechanical ventilation frequently meet the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnostic criteria.

Methods: 12 different airway management procedures were investigated during routine clinical care. A high-speed video camera (1000 frames\/second) was for imaging. Quantitative droplet characteristics as size, distance traveled, and velocity were computed. Results: Droplets were detected in 8\/12 procedures. The droplet trajectories could be divided into two distinctive patterns (type 1\/2). Type 1 represented a ballistic trajectory with higher speed droplets whereas type 2 represented a random trajectory of slower particles that persisted longer in air. Speaking and coughing lead to a larger amount of droplets than non-invasive ventilation therapy. The use of tracheal cannula filters reduced the amount of droplets. Conclusions: Respiratory droplet patterns generated during airway management procedures follow two distinctive trajectories based on the influence of aerodynamic forces. Speaking and coughing produce more droplets than non-invasive ventilation therapy confirming these behaviors as exposure risks. Even large droplets may exhibit patterns resembling the fluid dynamics smaller airborne aerosols that follow the airflow convectively and may place the healthcare provider at risk.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarina K Mueller","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg Medizinische Fakultat (FAU)"},{"author_name":"Reinhard Veltrup","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg Medizinische Fakultat (FAU)"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Jakubass","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg Medizinische Fakultat (FAU)"},{"author_name":"Stefan Kniesburges","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg Medizinische Fakultat (FAU)"},{"author_name":"Judith Kempfle","author_inst":"Massachusetts Eye Ear, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Matthias J.

However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The accuracy of the model is good (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18\\% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Mokhlesur Rahman","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"G.

In this cross-sectional study we examined if perceived social support, exercise in minutes per week and change in exercise are protective factors regarding symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleeping disorders. Method: In April 2020, n = 4271 German adults completed an online survey including mental health questionnaires regarding depression (PHQ-D), anxiety (PHQ-D) and sleep (PSQI), as well as questionnaires related to protective factors such as exercise (BSA-F), physical activity-related health competence (PAHCO) and social support (F-SozU). Results: Complete case analysis (n = 3700; mean age 33.13 {+\/-} 11.73 years, 78.6 % females) resulted in elevated prevalence of depressive disorder (31.4%), panic disorder (5.7%) and other anxiety disorders (7.4%). 58.3% reported symptoms of insomnia. Three separate models of multiple regression were conducted. Perceived social support was associated with lower values of anxiety (beta = -0.10; t(19) = -6.46; p >0.001), lower values of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.22; t(19) = -15.71; p < .001) and lower values of sleeping disorder symptoms (beta = -0.15; t(19) = -9.55; p < .001). Change towards less exercise compared to the time before Covid-19 was associated with and higher values of anxiety (beta = -0.05; t(19) = -2.85; p= .004), higher values of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.08; t(19) = -5.69; p < .001), and higher values of sleeping disorder symptoms (beta = -0.07; t(19) = -4.54; p < .000). Post-hoc analysis (ANOVAs) revealed that a change towards less exercise was significantly associated with more depressive, anxiety and sleeping disorder symptoms whereas a positive change was not. No significant association was found for exercise in minutes per week for all outcomes. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a negative impact on mental health in the German population. Social Support and a stable amount of exercise might attenuate these negative mental health consequences. Ongoing monitoring of the impact of the pandemic on mental health and possible protective factors is needed in order to create a basis for the development of appropriate prevention and intervention measures.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonie Louisa Bauer","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Britta Seiffer","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Clara Deinhart","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Atrott","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Gorden Sudeck","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Martin Hautzinger","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Inka R\u00f6sel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Wolf","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Prakash Jayabalan","author_inst":"Shirley Ryan AbilityLab"},{"author_name":"James M.

Methods A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from March 10, 2020, to May 17, 2020 with moderate to severe respiratory failure treated with High Flow nasal therapy (HFNT). HFNT patients were divided into two groups: HFNT only and HFNT progressed to IMV. The primary outcome was the ability of the ROX index to predict the need of IMV. Results Of the 837 patients with COVID-19, 129 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60.8 ({+\/-}13.6) years, BMI 32.6 ({+\/-}8), 58 (45 %) were female, 72 (55.8%) were African American, 40 (31%) Hispanic. 48 (37.2%) were smokers. Mean time to intubation was 2.5 days ({+\/-} 3.3). ROX index of less than 5 at HFNT initiation was predictive of progression to IMV (OR = 2.137, p = 0,052). Any decrease in ROX index after HFNT initiation was predictive of intubation (OR= 14.67, p <0.0001). {Delta}ROX (<=0 versus >0), peak D-dimer >4000 and admission GFR < 60 ml\/min were very strongly predictive of need for IMV (ROC = 0.86, p=). Mortality was 11.2% in HFNT only group versus 47.5% in the HFNT progressed to IMV group (p,0.0001). Mortality and need for pulmonary vasodilators were higher in the HNFT progressed to IMV group. Conclusion ROX index is a valuable, noninvasive tool to evaluate patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 treated with HFNT. ROX helps predicts need for IMV and thus limiting morbidity and mortality associated with IMV.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maulin Patel","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junad Chowdhury","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicole Mills","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robert Marron","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrew Gangemi","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zachariah Dorey-Stein","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ibraheem Yousef","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Zheng","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lauren Tragesser","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Julie Giurintano","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rohit Gupta","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Parth Rali","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqing Zhao","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicole Patlakh","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nathaniel Marchetti","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Gordon","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mun-Gwan Hong","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ben Murrell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Claudia Fredolini","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jochen M Schwenk","author_inst":"KTH - Royal Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144121","rel_title":"A network-informed analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis genes' interactions points to Neutrophil Extracellular Traps as mediators of thrombosis in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144121","rel_abs":"Abnormal coagulation and an increased risk of thrombosis are features of severe COVID-19, with parallels proposed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a life-threating condition associated with hyperinflammation. The presence of HLH was described in severely ill patients during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, presenting with pulmonary vascular thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that genes causing primary HLH regulate pathways linking pulmonary thromboembolism to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using novel network-informed computational algorithms. This approach led to the identification of Neutrophils Extracellular Traps (NETs) as plausible mediators of vascular thrombosis in severe COVID-19 in children and adults. Taken together, the network-informed analysis led us to propose the following model: the release of NETs in response to inflammatory signals acting in concert with SARS-CoV-2 damage the endothelium and direct platelet-activation promoting abnormal coagulation leading to serious complications of COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis is that genetic and\/or environmental conditions that favor the release of NETs may predispose individuals to thrombotic complications of COVID-19 due to an increase risk of abnormal coagulation. This would be a common pathogenic mechanism in conditions including autoimmune\/infectious diseases, hematologic and metabolic disorders.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Ding","author_inst":"Computational Biology Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, 15204"},{"author_name":"David Earl Hostallero","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada."},{"author_name":"Mohamed Reda El Khili","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Fonseca","author_inst":"The Meakins-Christie Laboratories at the Research Institute of the McGill University Heath Centre Research Institute, 1001 Boul.
