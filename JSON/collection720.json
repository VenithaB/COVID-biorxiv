As universities around the world decide whether to remain open or to close their campuses because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they often are doing so without objective information on the preferences and risk tolerance of their students. Objectives. To quantify: 1) risk tolerance for in-person instruction; 2) willingness to pay for in-person instruction versus online-only instruction; and 3) risk-tolerance for social activities held off campus among knowledgable students. Design, Setting, and Participants. We developed an automated survey tool that administered a standard gamble exercise grounded in game theory to 46 Columbia University public health graduate students who were knowledgeable about COVID-19 and who had experience with both online and offline coursework. Students were asked to trade between the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and: 1) attending classes in-person versus online and 2) attending parties in the greater New York City area. We also assessed their willingness to pay for online only tuition, and plans to travel off campus. Main Outcome Measures. The decision point in iterative trade-offs between risk of infection with COVID-19 and a desired goal (taking classes in-person or attending social events). Results. On average, students were willing to accept a 23% (standard error [SE]: 4%) risk of infection on campus over the semester in exchange for the opportunity to attend classes in-person. Students were willing-to-pay only 48% (SE: 3%) of typical in-person tuition were courses held exclusively online, and no students were willing to pay full price for online-only instruction. Students planned to leave campus an average of 3.6 times per week (SE: 0.54), and 15% of the students would be willing to attend a party in the community surrounding the university even if the prevalence of circulating COVID-19 were high. Conclusions and Relevance. Students with a strong knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and risks are an enigma: they are willing to pay only around 50% for online classes but likely to engage in activities that present significant barriers to holding in-person classes. This enigma underscores the conundrum facing universities.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zafar Zafari","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Lee Goldman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Katia Korvizhkin","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Peter Muennig","author_inst":"Columbia University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.27.20182923","rel_title":"Evaluation of production lots of a rapid point-of-care lateral flow serological test intended for identification of IgM and IgG against the N-terminal part of the spike protein (S1) of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.27.20182923","rel_abs":"Background and objectives: Several antibody tests are available to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, many of which address different antigens. Rapid point-of-care (POC) tests have been doubted due to an eventual risk of production errors, although it is unstudied whether such error would affect test sensitivity and\/or specificity. We aimed to evaluate two separate production lots of a commercially available test intended for rapid detection of IgM and IgG against the N-terminal part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1). Materials and methods: Serum samples from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, by RT-PCR and\/or serology, and pre-COVID-19 negative control sera gathered from a biobank during 2018 were collected. The presence of anti-S1 IgM\/IgG was verified by an in-house Luminex-based serological assay, serving as reference method. The index test was a commercially available rapid POC-test (the COVID-19 IgG\/IgM Rapid Test Cassette [Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China\/Healgen Scientific, LLC, U.S.A.]). Results: One hundred samples were verified positive for anti-S1 IgG (median fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than or equal to 900) and 74 for anti-S1 IgM (MFI greater than or equal to 700), confirmed by RT-PCR (n=90) and\/or serology (n=89). None of the negative controls (n=200; MFI <300) had SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgM, while one tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG. For the two lots, the sensitivities of the rapid test were 93.2% (69\/74; 95% CI: 85.1% - 97.1%) and 87.8% (65\/74; 95% CI: 78.5% - 93.5%) for IgM, respectively 93.0% (93\/100; 95% CI: 86.3% - 96.6%) and 100.0% for IgG (100\/100; 95% CI: 96.3% - 100.0%). The specificity for both lots was 100% for IgM (200\/200; 95% CI: 98.1% - 100%) and 99.5% for IgG (199\/200; 95% CI: 97.2% - 99.9%). The positive predictive value was 100% for IgM and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The negative predictive value was 95.7% and 97.6% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100.0% for IgG. Conclusion: The rapid POC-test used in this study is suitable to assess SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 specific IgM\/IgG, as a measure of previous virus exposure on an individual level. While the specificity was not affected by production lot, external validation of separate lots of rapid POC-tests is encouraged to ensure high sensitivity before market introduction.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tove Hoffman","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Linda Kolstad","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Bengt Ronnberg","author_inst":"Uppsala University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ake Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.20182675","rel_title":"Epidemiological and socio-economic characteristics of the COVID-19 spring outbreak in Quebec, Canada: A population-based study","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.20182675","rel_abs":"Background: By mid-July 2020, more than 108,000 COVID-19 cases had been diagnosed in Canada with more than half in the province of Quebec. To be prepared for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall, it seems of utmost importance to analyze the epidemiological and socio-economic characteristics of the spring outbreak in the population. Method: We conducted an online survey of the participants of the CARTaGENE population-based cohort, composed of middle-aged and older adults. We collected information on socio-demographic, lifestyle, health condition, COVID-related symptoms and COVID-19 testing. We studied the association between these factors and two outcomes: the status of having been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and the status of having received a positive test when having been tested. These associations were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyzes using a hybrid tree-based regression model. Results: Among the 8,129 respondents from the CARTaGENE cohort, 649 were tested for COVID-19 and 41 were positive. Medical workers and individuals having a contact with a COVID-19 patient had the highest probabilities of being tested (32% and 42.4%, respectively) and of being positive (17.2% and 13.0%, respectively) among those tested. 7.6% of the participants declared that they have experienced at least one of the four COVID-related symptoms chosen by the Public Health authorities (fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia) but were not tested. Results from the tree-based model analyzes adjusted on exposure factors show that the combination of dyspnea, dry cough and fever was highly associated with being tested whereas anosmia, fever, and headache were the most discriminant factors for having a positive test among those tested. During the spring outbreak, more than one third of the participants have experienced a decrease in access to health services. There were sex and age differences in the socio-economic and emotional impacts of the pandemic. Conclusion: We have shown some discrepancies between the symptoms associated with being tested and being positive. In particular, the anosmia is a major discriminant symptom for positivity whereas ear-nose-throat symptoms seem not to be COVID-related. The results also emphasize the need of increasing the accessibility of testing for the general population.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rodolphe Jantzen","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nolwenn Noisel","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sophie Camilleri-Broet","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Catherine Labbe","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Thibault de Malliard","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yves Payette","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Philippe Broet","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.20180950","rel_title":"What is the recovery rate and risk of long-term consequences following a diagnosis of COVID-19? - A harmonised, global longitudinal observational study","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.20180950","rel_abs":"Introduction Very little is known about possible clinical sequelae that may persist after resolution of the acute Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A recent longitudinal cohort from Italy including 143 patients recovered after hospitalisation with COVID-19 reported that 87% had at least one ongoing symptom at 60 day follow-up. Early indications suggest that patients with COVID-19 may need even more psychological support than typical ICU patients. The assessment of risk factors for longer term consequences requires a longitudinal study linked to data on pre-existing conditions and care received during the acute phase of illness. Methods and analysis This is an international open-access prospective, observational multi-site study. It will enrol patients following a diagnosis of COVID-19. Tier 1 is developed for following up patients day 28 post-discharge, additionally at 3 to 6 months intervals. This module can be used to identify sub-sets of patients experiencing specific symptomatology or syndromes for further follow up. A Tier 2 module will be developed for in-clinic, in-depth follow up. The primary aim is to characterise physical consequences in patients post-COVID-19. Secondary aim includes estimating the frequency of and risk factors for post-COVID- 19 medical sequalae, psychosocial consequences and post-COVID-19 mortality. A subset of patients will have sampling to characterize longer term antibody, innate and cell-mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Ethics and dissemination This collaborative, open-access study aims to characterize the frequency of and risk factors for long-term consequences and characterise the immune response over time in patients following a diagnosis of COVID-19 and facilitate standardized and longitudinal data collection globally. The outcomes of this study will inform strategies to prevent long term consequences; inform clinical management, direct rehabilitation, and inform public health management to reduce overall morbidity and improve outcomes of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise Sigfrid","author_inst":"ISARIC Global Support Centre,  University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Muge Cevik","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Edwin Jesudason","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Wei Shen Lim","author_inst":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jordi Rello","author_inst":"Vall d Hebron Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"John Humphrey Amuasi","author_inst":"Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and Kumasi Center for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fernando Bozza","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Carlo Palmieri","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Daniel Munblit","author_inst":"Institute of Childs Health, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University)"},{"author_name":"Jan Cato Holter","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anders Benjamin Kildal","author_inst":"University Hospital of North Norway"},{"author_name":"Clark D Russell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Antonia Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Lance Turtle","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Thomas M Drake","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Anna Beltrame","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katrina Hann","author_inst":"Sustainable Health Systems"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Richard Bangura","author_inst":"Dorothy Springer Trust"},{"author_name":"Rob Fowler","author_inst":"Sunnybrook hospital, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sulaiman Lakoh","author_inst":"Sustainable Health Systems"},{"author_name":"Colin Berry","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"David J Lowe","author_inst":"Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joanne McPeake","author_inst":"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, University of Glasgow Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Madiha Hashmi","author_inst":"Critical Care Medicine, Ziauddin University, Pakistan Registry of Intensive CarE (PRICE)"},{"author_name":"Anne Margarita Dyrhol-Riise","author_inst":"Oslo University hospital"},{"author_name":"Chloe Donohue","author_inst":"Liverpool Clinical Trials Centre, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Plotkin","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hayley Hardwick","author_inst":"National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Liverpool, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Natalie Elkheir","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"Usher Institute"},{"author_name":"Annemarie B Docherty","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ewen M Harrison","author_inst":"Usher Institute,  University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kenneth J Baille","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Gail Carson","author_inst":"ISARIC, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Semple","author_inst":"Health Protection Research Unit In Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Janet T Scott","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.20182709","rel_title":"Cardiometabolic Risk Factors for COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.20182709","rel_abs":"Importance: Early epidemiological studies report associations of diverse cardiometabolic conditions especially body mass index (BMI), with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, but causality has not been established. Identifying causal risk factors is critical to inform preventive strategies aimed at modifying disease risk. Objective: We sought to evaluate the causal associations of cardiometabolic conditions with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Design: Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) Study. Setting: Population-based cohorts that contributed to the genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Participants: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosed by RNA PCR, serologic testing, or clinician diagnosis. Population controls defined as anyone who was not a case in the cohorts. Exposures: Selected genetic variants associated with 17 cardiometabolic diseases, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and BMI, at p<5 x 10-8 from published largescale GWAS. Main outcomes: We performed an inverse-variance weighted averages of variant-specific causal estimates for susceptibility, defined as people who tested positive for COVID-19 vs. population controls, and severity, defined as patients hospitalized with COVID-19 vs. population controls, and repeated the analysis for BMI using effect estimates from UKBB. To estimate direct and indirect causal effects of BMI through obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases, we performed pairwise multivariable MR. We used p<0.05\/17 exposure\/2 outcomes=0.0015 to declare statistical significance. Results: Genetically increased BMI was causally associated with testing positive for COVID-19 [6,696 cases \/ 1,073,072 controls; p=6.7 x 10-4, odds ratio and 95% confidence interval 1.08 (1.03, 1.13) per kg\/m2] and a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization [3,199 cases\/897,488 controls; p=8.7 x 10-4, 1.12 (1.04, 1.21) per kg\/m2]. In the multivariable MR, the direct effect of BMI was abolished upon conditioning on the effect on type 2 diabetes but persisted when conditioning on the effects on coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and c-reactive protein. No other cardiometabolic exposures tested were associated with a higher risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: Genetic evidence supports BMI as a causal risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. This relationship may be mediated via type 2 diabetes. Obesity may have amplified the disease burden of the COVID-19 pandemic either single-handedly or through its metabolic consequences.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aaron Leong","author_inst":"MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL"},{"author_name":"Joanne Cole","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura N.

While the landscape of diagnostics is rapidly evolving, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold-standard of nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays, in part due to its reliability, flexibility, and wide deployment. To address a critical local shortage of testing capacity persisting during the COVID-19 outbreak, our hospital set up a molecular based laboratory developed test (LDT) to accurately and safely diagnose SARS-CoV-2. We describe here the process of developing an emergency-use LDT, in the hope that our experience will be useful to other laboratories in future outbreaks and will help to lower barriers to fast and accurate diagnostic testing in crisis conditions.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Melis N.

The national survey 'COVID-19 related Anxiety and StreSs in prEgnancy, poSt-partum and breaStfeeding' (COVID-ASSESS) was conducted during the first month of full lockdown in Italy. The questionnaire was specifically developed to examine COVID-19 concerns and included the psychometric tests NSESSS for PTSD and STAI-Y for anxiety. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to explore the association of the concern, anxiety and PTSD symptoms with age, gestational weeks, parity, days of lockdown, assisted reproductive technology use, psychopathological history and previous perinatal losses. Out of 1015 pregnant women reached, 737 (72.6%) fully answered the questionnaire; no woman reported a COVID-19 infection. Median age was 34.4 years [quartiles 31.7, 37.2], median days in lockdown were 13.1 [11.0, 17.0], median gestational weeks were 27.8 [19.8, 34.0].

With regards to long-term consequences, biomarkers of physiological effects as well as the psychological experiences are of significant importance for comprehensively understanding the whole COVID-19 recovery period. The present research surveys the IgG antibody titers and the impact of COVID-19 as a traumatic experience in the aftermath of the active infection period, around two months after diagnosis, in a subset of COVID-19 patients from the first wave of the outbreak in Northern Cyprus. Associations of antibody titers and psychological survey measures with baseline characteristics and disease severity were explored, and correlations among various measures were evaluated. Of the 47 serology tests conducted for presence of IgG antibodies, 39 (83%) were positive. We identified trends demonstrating individuals experiencing severe or critical COVID-19 disease and\/or those with comorbidities are more heavily impacted both physiologically and mentally, with higher IgG titers and negative psychological experience compared to those with milder disease and without comorbidities. We also observed that more than half of the COVID-19 cases had negative psychological experiences, being subjected to discrimination and\/or verbal harassment\/insult, by family\/friends. In summary, as the first study co-evaluating immune response together with mental status, our findings suggest that further multidisciplinary research in larger sample populations as well as community intervention plans are needed to holistically address the physiological and psychological effects of COVID-19 among the cases in the long-term.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Burc Barin","author_inst":"The Emmes Company, Rockville, Maryland, USA."},{"author_name":"Banu Elcin Yoldascan","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Cyprus International University, Nicosia, North Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Fatma Savaskan","author_inst":"Headnursing Department, Burhan Nalbantoglu State Hospital, Nicosia, North Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Goncagul Ozbalikci","author_inst":"Microbiology Laboratory, Burhan Nalbantoglu State Hospital, Nicosia, North Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Tugce Karaderi","author_inst":"Disease Systems Biology Program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhag"},{"author_name":"Huseyin Cakal","author_inst":"School of Psychology, Keele University, Keele, ST5 5BG, Staffordshire, UK."},{"author_name":"Stephen F.

The importance of indoor, airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized; nevertheless, no quantitative measures have been proposed to protect against it. In this article, we build upon models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive a safety guideline that would impose a precise upper bound on the cumulative exposure time, the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate the manner in which this bound depends on the ventilation rate and dimensions of the room; the breathing rate, respiratory activity and face-mask use of its occupants; and the infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols, a disease-specific parameter that we estimate from available data. Case studies are presented, implications for contact tracing considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin Z.

Design: National, cross-sectional study. Setting: Mexico. Participants: 416546 adult patients; 4178 Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 were the primary population under study. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was mortality from COVID-19 up to August 3rd, 2020. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios while adjusting for confounders. Results: Among all patients with COVID-19, whether hospitalized or not, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died compared to non-Indigenous people (16.5% vs 11.1%, respectively). Among hospitalized patients, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died (37.1%) compared to non-Indigenous peoples (36.3%). Deaths outside the hospital were also higher among Indigenous peoples (3.7% vs 1.7%). A higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died in both the private and public health care sectors. The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.24). The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was higher among those who received only ambulatory care (1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.92). Conclusions: In the large sample of patients with COVID-19, the findings suggest that Indigenous peoples in Mexico have a higher risk of death from COVID-19, especially outside the hospital. These findings suggest Indigenous peoples lack access to care more so than non-Indigenous people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. More research is needed regarding the impact of the COVID-19 among racial and ethnic minorities in Mexico.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ismael Ibarra-Nava","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon"},{"author_name":"Kathia G.

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Data collected from the Catalan Health Surveillance System (CatSalut) in Catalonia, a region of Spain. PARTICIPANTS Using data collected between 1 March and 1 June 2020, we conducted the following comparative analyses: people infected by SARS-CoV-2 (328 892) vs Catalonia's entire population (7 699 568); COVID-19 cases who required hospitalisation (37 638) vs cases who did not require hospitalisation (291 254); and COVID-19 cases who died during the study period vs cases who did not die during the study period (12 287). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Three clinical outcomes related to COVID-19 (infection, hospitalisation, or death). We analysed sociodemographic and environment variables (such as residing in a nursing home) and the presence of previous comorbidities. RESULTS A total of 328 892 cases were considered to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (4.27% of total population). The main risk factors for the diagnostic were: female gender (risk ratio [RR] =1.49; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] =1.48-1.50), age (45-64 years old; RR=1.02; 95% CI=1.01-1.03), high comorbidity burden (GMA index) (RR=3.03; 95% CI=2.97-3.09), reside in a nursing home (RR=11.82; 95% CI=11.66-11.99), and smoking (RR=1.06; 95% CI=1.05-1.07). During the study period, there were 37 638 (11.4 %) hospitalisations due to COVID-19, and the risk factors were: male gender (RR=1.45; 95% CI=1.43-1.48), age > 65 (RR=2.38; 95% CI=2.28-2.48), very low individual income (RR=1.03; 95% CI=0.97-1.08), and high burden of comorbidities (GMA index) (RR=5.15; 95% CI=4.89-5.42). The individual comorbidities with higher burden were obesity (RR=1.23; 95% CI=1.20-1.25), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR=1.19; 95% CI=1.15-1.22), heart failure (RR=1.19; 95% CI=1.16-1.22), diabetes mellitus (RR=1.07; 95% CI=1.04-1.10), and neuro-psychiatric comorbidities (RR=1.06; 95% CI=1.03-1.10). A total of 12 287 deaths (3.73%) were attributed to COVID-19, and the main risk factors were: male gender (RR=1.73; 95% CI=1.67-1.81), age > 65 (RR=37.45; 95% CI=29.23-47.93), residing in a nursing home (RR=9.22; 95% CI=8.81-9.65), and high burden of comorbidities (GMA index) (RR=5.25; 95% CI=4.60-6.00). The individual comorbidities with higher burden were: heart failure (RR=1.21; 95% CI=1.16-1.22), chronic kidney disease (RR=1.17; 95% CI=1.13-1.22), and diabetes mellitus (RR=1.10; 95% CI=1.06-1.14). These results did not change significantly when we considered only PCR-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS Female gender, age between 45 to 64 years old, high burden of comorbidities, and factors related to environment (nursing home) play a relevant role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. In addition, we found risk factors for hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19 that had not been described to date, including comorbidity burden, neuro-psychiatric disorders, and very low individual income. This study supports interventions for transmission control beyond stratify-and-shield strategies focused only on protecting those at risk of death. Future COVID-19 studies should examine the role of gender, the burden of comorbidities, and socioeconomic status in disease transmission, and should determine its relationship to workplaces, especially healthcare centres and nursing homes.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Judit Villar-Garcia","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rosa Maria Vivanco-Hidalgo","author_inst":"Agencia de Qualitat i Avaluacio Sanitaries de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Cleries","author_inst":"Area de sistemes de informacio, Servei Catala de la Salut, Generalitat de Catalunya Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elisenda Martinez","author_inst":"Agencia de Qualitat i Avaluacio Sanitaries de Catalunya Barcelona,Spain"},{"author_name":"David Monterde","author_inst":"Sistemes de Informacio, Institut Catala de la Salut Barcelona,Spain"},{"author_name":"Pol Perez-Sust","author_inst":"Area de Sistemes de Informacio.

An accurate prognostic assessment is necessary to improve survival of patients, especially in developing countries. This study proposes to predict the risk of developing critical conditions in COVID-19 patients by training multipurpose algorithms. Methods A total of 1,040 patients with a positive RT-PCR diagnosis for COVID-19 from a large hospital from Sao Paulo, Brazil, were followed from March to June 2020, of which 288 (28%) presented a severe prognosis, i.e. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, use of mechanical ventilation or death. Routinely-collected laboratory, clinical and demographic data was used to train five machine learning algorithms (artificial neural networks, extra trees, random forests, catboost, and extreme gradient boosting). A random sample of 70% of patients was used to train the algorithms and 30% were left for performance assessment, simulating new unseen data. In order to assess if the algorithms could capture general severe prognostic patterns, each model was trained by combining two out of three outcomes to predict the other. Results All algorithms presented very high predictive performance (average AUROC of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.92, and specificity of 0.82). The three most important variables for the multipurpose algorithms were ratio of lymphocyte per C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein and Braden Scale. Conclusion The results highlight the possibility that machine learning algorithms are able to predict unspecific negative COVID-19 outcomes from routinely-collected data.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernando Timoteo Fernandes","author_inst":"Fundacentro"},{"author_name":"Tiago Almeida de Oliveira","author_inst":"Paraiba State University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Esteves Teixeira","author_inst":"National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Andre Filipe de Moraes Batista","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Dalla Costa","author_inst":"BP - A Beneficencia Portuguesa de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Chiavegatto Filho","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Luis Garcia-Eroles","author_inst":"Area de Sistemes de Informacio.

It is proposed that it could be used to display direct retrieval and the functional sequelae of COVID-19. Aim of the study: To assess the Post COVID-19 functional status in Egypt and to evaluate if age, gender, comorbidities have any effect on functional limitations in recovered COVID-19 patients. Patients and methods: A total of 444 registered confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. They were interviewed in our follow-up clinics or by calls and filled an Arabic translated PCFS scale in paper or online forms as well as their demographic and clinical data. Results: 80% of COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible (63.1%), slight (14.4%), moderate (2%) to severe (0.5%) based on PCFS. Furthermore, there was a substantial variance between the score of PCFS with age (P= 0.003), gender (P= 0.014), the duration since the onset of the symptoms of COVID-19 (P <0.001), need for oxygen supplementation (P<0.001), need for ICU admittance (P= 0.003), previous periodic influenza vaccination (P<0.001), smoking status (P < 0.001) and lastly the presence of any comorbid disorder (P <0.001). Conclusions: Most of the COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible to severe based on PCFS. These restrictions were affected by age, gender, periodic influenza vaccination, smoking, duration since symptoms onset, need for oxygen or ICU admittance, and lastly the presence of coexisting comorbidity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aliae Mohamed-Hussein","author_inst":"Faculty of medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Islam Galal","author_inst":"Chest Department, Aswan University"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Saad","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Hossam Eldeen Zayan","author_inst":"Assiut University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Moustafa Abdelsayed","author_inst":"Assiut University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Moustafa","author_inst":"Chest Department, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Abdel Rahman Ezzat","author_inst":"Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Radwa Helmy","author_inst":"Assiut Unicersity"},{"author_name":"Howaida Abd Elaal","author_inst":"Faculty of Nursing, Aswan University"},{"author_name":"Karim Aly","author_inst":"Cardiology, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Shaimaa Abderheem","author_inst":"Public Health, Aswan University"},{"author_name":"Hetal Desai Marble","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lauren L.

During a time of social distancing measures and increasing social isolation, green spaces may be a crucial factor to maintain a physically and socially active lifestyle while not increasing risk of infection. Objectives: We evaluated whether greenness is related to COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the United States. Methods: We downloaded data on COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US county up through June 7, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. We used April-May 2020 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, to represent the greenness exposure during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the US. We fitted negative binomial mixed models to evaluate associations of NDVI with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders such as county-level demographics, epidemic stage, and other environmental factors. We evaluated whether the associations were modified by population density, proportion of Black residents, median home value, and issuance of stay-at-home order. Results: An increase of 0.1 in NDVI was associated with a 6% (95% Confidence Interval: 3%, 10%) decrease in COVID-19 incidence rate after adjustment for potential confounders. Associations with COVID-19 incidence were stronger in counties with high population density and high median home values, and in counties with stay-at-home orders. Greenness was not associated with COVID-19 mortality in all counties; however, it was protective in counties with high percentages of Black residents, high median home value, and higher population density. Discussion: Exposures to NDVI had beneficial impacts on county-level incidence of COVID-19 in the US and may have reduced county-level COVID-19 mortality rates, especially in densely populated counties.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jochem O Klompmaker","author_inst":"Harvard T.

There is a need to combine diverse, multi-omic data in order to evaluate and substantiate the most robust evidence and inform development of future therapies. We conducted a systematic review of experiments identifying host factors involved in human betacoronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, seasonal coronaviruses). Gene lists from these diverse sources were integrated using Meta-Analysis by Information Content (MAIC). This previously described algorithm uses data-driven gene list weightings to produce a comprehensive ranked list of implicated host genes. 5,418 genes implicated in human betacoronavirus infection were identified from 32 datasets. The top ranked gene was PPIA, encoding cyclophilin A. Pharmacological inhibition with cyclosporine in vitro exerts antiviral activity against several coronaviruses including SARS-CoV. Other highly-ranked genes included proposed prognostic factors (CXCL10, CD4, CD3E) and investigational therapeutic targets (IL1A) for COVID-19, but also previously overlooked genes with potential as therapeutic targets. Gene rankings also inform the interpretation of COVID-19 GWAS results, implicating FYCO1 over other nearby genes in a disease-associated locus on chromosome 3. Pathways enriched in gene rankings included T-cell receptor signalling, protein processing, and viral infections. We identified limited overlap of our gene list with host genes implicated in ARDS (innate immune and inflammation genes) and Influenza A virus infection (RNA-binding and ribosome-associated genes). We will continue to update this dynamic ranked list of host genes as the field develops, as a resource to inform and prioritise future studies.

Using comprehensive death records covering around 300 million Chinese people, we estimate the impacts of city and community lockdowns on non-COVID-19 mortality outside of Wuhan. Employing a difference-in-differences method, we find that lockdowns reduced the number of non-COVID-19 deaths by 4.9% (cardiovascular deaths by 6.2%, injuries by 9.2%, and non-COVID-19 pneumonia deaths by 14.3%). The health benefits are likely driven by significant reductions in air pollution, traffic, and human interactions. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that more than 32,000 lives could have been saved from non-COVID-19 diseases\/causes during the 40 days of the lockdown on which we focus. The results suggest that the rapid and strict virus countermeasures not only effectively controlled the spread of COVID-19 but also brought about massive unintended public health benefits. These findings can help better inform policymakers around the world about the benefits and costs of city and community lockdowns policies in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinlei Qi","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Dandan Zhang","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Peng Yin","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Jianmei Liu","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Yuhang Pan","author_inst":"Division of Environment and Sustainability, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Tanakao Takana","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Peiyu Xie","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoguang Wang","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shuocen Liu","author_inst":"Peking University HSBC Business School, Peking University, University Town, Nanshan District, 518055 Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 155 Changbai Road, Changping District, 102206 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Guojun He","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Division of Environment and Sustainability, and Department of Economics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water"},{"author_name":"Maigeng Zhou","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Julie Batten","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"N.

Methods: Twenty-seven (27) states in the United States were selected on June 17, 2020 from IHME data which had clearly defined and dated establishment of statewide mandates for social distancing measures to include: School closures, Prohibition on mass gatherings, business closures, stay at home orders, severe travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses. The state Covid-19 mortality prevalence was defined as total normalized deaths to the peak daily mortality rate. The state mortality prevalence was correlated to the total number of mandates-days from their date of establishment to the peak daily mortality date. The slope of the maximum daily mortality rate was also correlated to mandate-days. Results: The standardized mortality per state to the initial peak mortality rate did not demonstrate a discernable correlation to the total mandate days (R2 = 0.000006, p= 0.995). The standardized peak mortality rate per state suggested a slight correlation to the total mandate days (R2 = 0.053,p=0.246), but was not statistically significant. There was a significant correlation between standardized mortality and state population density (R2 = 0.524,p=0.00002). Conclusions: The analysis appears to suggest no mandate effective reduction in Covid-19 mortality nor a reduction in Covid-19 mortality rate to its defined initial peak when interpreting the mean-effect of the mandates as present in the data. A strong correlation to population density suggests human interaction frequency does affect the total mortality and maximum mortality rate.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean McCafferty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sean Ashley","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Peng Yin","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Jianmei Liu","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Yuhang Pan","author_inst":"Division of Environment and Sustainability, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Tanakao Takana","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Peiyu Xie","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoguang Wang","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shuocen Liu","author_inst":"Peking University HSBC Business School, Peking University, University Town, Nanshan District, 518055 Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 155 Changbai Road, Changping District, 102206 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Guojun He","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Division of Environment and Sustainability, and Department of Economics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water"},{"author_name":"Maigeng Zhou","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Julie Batten","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"N.

As public reception is paramount to success, we conducted a systematic examination of socio-demographic characteristics that predict downloads of a contact tracing application. Participants were 505 adults who completed a web-based survey in Singapore, the site of the first contact tracing application (TraceTogether). We found that persons who had already changed their lifestyles on account of the pandemic were more likely to download the application. Network analyses revealed that contact tracing downloads was associated with using hand sanitizers, avoiding public transport, and preferring outdoor over indoor venues during the pandemic. However, demographic and situational characteristics were not significant predictors of application downloads. Together, these findings provide a base for policy makers to promote the uptake of digital contact tracing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Young Ern Saw","author_inst":"Yale-NUS College"},{"author_name":"Edina Y-Q Tan","author_inst":"Yale-NUS College"},{"author_name":"Jessica S Liu","author_inst":"Yale-NUS College"},{"author_name":"Jean CJ Liu","author_inst":"Yale-NUS College"},{"author_name":"Jianmei Liu","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Yuhang Pan","author_inst":"Division of Environment and Sustainability, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Tanakao Takana","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Peiyu Xie","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoguang Wang","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shuocen Liu","author_inst":"Peking University HSBC Business School, Peking University, University Town, Nanshan District, 518055 Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 155 Changbai Road, Changping District, 102206 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Guojun He","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Division of Environment and Sustainability, and Department of Economics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water"},{"author_name":"Maigeng Zhou","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Julie Batten","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"N.

Early evidence points to significant endothelial dysfunction, micro-thromboses, pro-inflammation as well as a dysregulated immune response in the pathogenesis of this disease. In this study, we analyzed the cargo of EVs isolated from the plasma of patients with COVID-19 for the identification of potential biomarkers of disease severity and to explore their role in disease pathogenesis. Plasma-derived EVs were isolated from 53 hospitalized patients with COVID infection and compared according to the severity of the disease. Analysis of inflammatory and cardiovascular protein cargo of large EVs revealed significantly differentially expressed proteins for each disease sub-group. Notably, members of the TNF superfamily and IL-6 family were up-regulated in patients on oxygen support with severe and moderate disease. EVs from the severe group were also enhanced with pro-thrombotic\/endothelial injury factors (TF, t-PA, vWF) and proteins associated with cardiovascular pathology (MB, PRSS8, REN, HGF). Significantly higher levels of TF, CD163, and EN-RAGE were observed in EVs from severe patients when compared to patients with a moderate disease requiring supplemental O2. Importantly, we also observed increased caspase 3\/7 activity and decreased cell survival in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells exposed to EVs from the plasma of patients with severe disease compared to healthy controls. In conclusion, our findings indicate alterations in pro-inflammatory, coagulopathy, and endothelial injury protein cargo in large EVs in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may be a causative agent in severe illness.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Balaji Krishnamachary","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christine Cook","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Leslie Spikes","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Prabhakar Chalise","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Navneet K Dhillon","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yuhang Pan","author_inst":"Division of Environment and Sustainability, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Tanakao Takana","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Peiyu Xie","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoguang Wang","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shuocen Liu","author_inst":"Peking University HSBC Business School, Peking University, University Town, Nanshan District, 518055 Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 155 Changbai Road, Changping District, 102206 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Guojun He","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Division of Environment and Sustainability, and Department of Economics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water"},{"author_name":"Maigeng Zhou","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Julie Batten","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"N.

Here, we investigated the MAIT cell compartment in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease, as well as in convalescence. We show profound and preferential decline in MAIT cells in circulation of patients with active disease paired with strong activation, as well as significant MAIT cell enrichment and pro-inflammatory IL-17A bias in the airways. Unsupervised analysis identified MAIT cell CD69high and CXCR3low immunotypes associated with poor clinical outcome. MAIT cell levels normalized in the convalescent phase, consistent with dynamic recruitment to the tissues and subsequent release with disease resolution. These findings indicate that MAIT cells are engaged in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest their involvement in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiphaine Parrot","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jean-Baptiste Gorin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ponzetta","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kimia T Maleki","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tobias Kammann","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Johanna Emgard","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andre Perez Potti","author_inst":"Karrolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Takuya Sekine","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Olga Rivera-Ballesteros","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Elin Folkesson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Olav Rooyackers","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Lars I Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Soo Aleman","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Marcus Buggert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Johan K.

Reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Due to technical limitations, the reported positive rates of qRT-PCR assay of throat swab samples vary from 30%-60%. Therefore, the evaluation of alternative strategies to overcome the limitations of qRT-PCR is required. A previous study reported that one-step nested (OSN)-qRT-PCR revealed better suitability for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, information on the analytical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR is insufficient. In this study, we aimed to analyze OSN-qRT-PCR by comparing it with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and qRT-PCR by using a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA and a quality assessment panel. The clinical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR was also validated and compared with ddPCR and qRT-PCR using specimens from COVID-19 patients. The LoD (copies\/ml) of qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and OSN-qRT-PCR were 520.1 (95% CI): 363.23-1145.69) for ORF1ab and 528.1 (95% CI: 347.7-1248.7) for N, 401.8 (95% CI: 284.8-938.3) for ORF1ab and 336.8 (95% CI: 244.6-792.5) for N, and 194.74 (95% CI: 139.7-430.9) for ORF1ab and 189.1 (95% CI: 130.9-433.9) for N, respectively. Of the 34 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, the positive rates of OSN-qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and qRT-PCR were 82.35% (28\/34), 67.65% (23\/34), and 58.82% (20\/34), respectively. In conclusion, the highly sensitive and specific OSN-qRT-PCR assay is superior to ddPCR and qRT-PCR assays, showing great potential as a technique for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with low viral loads.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Dai","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Huiyan Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital, Fuyang Infectious Disease Clinical College, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tuantuan Li","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital, Fuyang Infectious Disease Clinical College, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yan Fang","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital, Fuyang Infectious Disease Clinical College, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zuojun Shen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Lichang Chen","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital, Fuyang Infectious Disease Clinical College, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhaowu Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Xuejun Ma","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and prevention"},{"author_name":"Ming Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Olav Rooyackers","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Lars I Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Soo Aleman","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Marcus Buggert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Johan K.

We adjusted estimates for sensitivity of laboratory assays and accounted for prospective community screenings and healthcare seeking behaviors. Rates of symptomatic cases, medical consultations, hospitalizations and deaths were estimated at 796 (95%CI: 703-977), 489 (472-509), 370 (358-384), and 36.2 (35.0-37.3) per 100,000 persons, respectively. The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan had higher burden than the 2009 influenza pandemic or seasonal influenza, and that clinical severity was similar to that of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Our comparison puts the COVID-19 pandemic into context and could be helpful to guide intervention strategies and preparedness for the potential resurgence of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Gong","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Han Yan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qianhui Wu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Huilin Shi","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shengjie Lai","author_inst":"1.

To clarify that, we assessed the values of several inflammatory biomarkers and hemocytometry variables in a cohort of obstetric patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 and we correlated the values at admission with the need of oxygen supplementation during the hospitalization. Overall, among 27 (61%) pregnant women and 17 (39%) post-partum women, 6 (14%) patients received oxygen supplementation and 2 (4%) required admission to intensive care unit but none died. During hospitalization neutrophils (p=0.002), neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (p=0.037) and C reactive protein (p<0.001) decreased significantly, whereas lymphocytes (p<0.001) and platelets (p<0.001) increased. Leukocytes and lymphocytes values at admission were correlated with oxygen need, with respectively a 1% and 5% higher risk of oxygen supplementation for each 1,000 cells decrease. Overall, in obstetric patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019, C reactive protein is the inflammatory biomarker that better mirrors the course of the disease whereas D-dimer or ferritin are not reliable predictors of poor outcome.

Objectives: This review aimed to identify which clinical dental procedures do generate droplets and aerosols with subsequent contamination, and for these, characterise their pattern, spread and settle. Materials and Method: Six databases were searched and citation chasing undertaken (to 11\/08\/20). Screening stages were undertaken in duplicate, independently, by two researchers. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Results: Eighty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and covered: Ultrasonic scaling (USS, n=44), high speed air-rotor (HSAR, n=31); oral surgery (n=11), slow-speed handpiece (n=4); air-water (triple) syringe (n=4), air-polishing (n=4), prophylaxis (n=2) and hand-scaling (n=2). Although no studies investigated respiratory viruses, those on bacteria, blood splatter and aerosol showed activities using powered devices produced the greatest contamination. Contamination was found for all activities, and at the furthest points studied. The operator torso operator arm, and patient body were especially affected. Heterogeneity precluded significant inter-study comparisons but intra-study comparisons allowed construction of a proposed hierarchy of procedure contamination risk: higher risk (USS, HSAR, air-water syringe [air only or air\/water together], air polishing, extractions using motorised hand-pieces); moderate (slow-speed handpieces, prophylaxis with pumice, extractions) and lower (air-water syringe [water only] and hand scaling. Conclusion: Significant gaps in the evidence, low sensitivity of measures and variable quality limit firm conclusions around contamination for different procedures. However, a hierarchy of contamination from procedures can be proposed for challenge\/verification by future research which should consider standardised methodologies to facilitate research synthesis. Clinical significance (49 words): This manuscript addresses uncertainty around aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) in dentistry. Findings indicate a continuum of procedure-related aerosol generation rather than the current binary AGP or non-AGP perspective. This informs discussion around AGPs and direct future research to help support knowledge and decision making around COVID-19 and dental procedures.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Innes","author_inst":"University of Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Ilona Johnson","author_inst":"University of Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Waraf Al-Yaseen","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Harris","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Rhiannon Jones","author_inst":"University of Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Sukriti KC","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Scott McGregor","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Mark Robertson","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"William Wade","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lars I Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Soo Aleman","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Marcus Buggert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Johan K.

The purpose of this study is to assess the seroprevalence rate in the Palestinian population residing in the West Bank. Blood samples were collected between 15th June 2020 and 30th June 2020 from 1355 individuals from randomly selected households in the West Bank in addition to 1136 individuals visiting Palestinian medical laboratories between the 1st May 2020 and 9th July 2020 for a routine checkup. Out of the 2491 blood samples collected, serological tests for 2455 adequate serum samples were done using an Immunoassay for qualitative detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 .The random sample of Palestinians living in the West Bank yielded 0% seroprevalence with 95% CI [0,0.0036], while the lab referrals sample yielded an estimated seroprevalence of 0.354% with 95% CI [0.0011,0096]. Our results indicate that as of July 2020, seroprevalence in Palestine persist low and is inadequate to provide herd immunity, emphasizing the need to maintain health measures to keep the outbreak under control. Population-based seroprevalence studies are to be conducted periodically to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Palestine and inform policy makers about the efficacy of their surveillance system.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nouar Qutob","author_inst":"arab american university"},{"author_name":"Faisal Awartani","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Zaidoun Salah","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Asia","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Imad Abu Khader","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Khaled Herzallah","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Nadeen Balqis","author_inst":"Nadeen.Balqis@aaup.edu"},{"author_name":"Husam Sallam","author_inst":"Husam.Sallam@aaup.edu"},{"author_name":"William Wade","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lars I Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Soo Aleman","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Marcus Buggert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Johan K.

Design: After geographically-spaced community sampling of households, one individual per household was tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N-protein in a two-week interval. Setting: Slum and non-slum communities in three wards, one each from the three main zones of Mumbai. Participants: Individuals over age 12 who consent to and have no contraindications to venipuncture were eligible. 6,904 participants (4,202 from slums and 2,702 from non-slums) were tested. Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were the positive test rate for IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein by demographic group (age and gender) and location (slums and non-slums). The secondary outcome is seroprevalence at slum and non-slum levels. Sera was tested via chemiluminescence (CLIA) using Abbott Diagnostics ArchitectTM N-protein based test. Seroprevalence was calculated using weights to match the population distribution by age and gender and accounting for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the test. Results: The positive test rate was 54.1% (95% CI: 52.7 to 55.6) and 16.1% (95% CI: 14.9 to 17.4) in slums and non-slums, respectively, a difference of 38 percentage points (P < 0.001). Accounting for imperfect accuracy of tests (e.g., sensitivity, 0.90; specificity 1.00), seroprevalence was as high as 58.4% (95% CI: 56.8 to 59.9) and 17.3% (95% CI: 16 to 18.7) in slums and non-slums, respectively. Conclusions: The high seroprevalence in slums implies a moderate infection fatality rate. The stark difference in seroprevalence across slums and non-slums has implications for the efficacy of social distancing, the level of herd immunity, and equity. It underlines the importance of geographic specificity and urban structure in modeling SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anup Malani","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Daksha Shah","author_inst":"Brahinmumbai Municipal Corporation"},{"author_name":"Gagandeep Kang","author_inst":"Vellore Christian Medical College"},{"author_name":"Gayatri Nair Lobo","author_inst":"A.T.E.
