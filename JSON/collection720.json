No treatment tested worldwide has shown unquestionable efficacy in the fight against COVID 19, according to NICE reports. We have designed an experimental treatment called IDEA based on four affordable drugs already available on the market in Argentina, based on the following rationale: -Ivermectin solution at a relatively high dose to lower the viral load in all stages of COVID 19 -Dexamethasone 4-mg injection, as anti-inflammatory drug to treat hyperinflammatory reaction to COVID-infection -Enoxaparin injection as anticoagulant to treat hypercoagulation in severe cases. -Aspirin 250-mg tablets to prevent hypercoagulation in mild and moderate cases Except for Ivermection oral solution, which was used in a higher dose than approved for parasitosis, all other drugs were used in the already approved dose and indication. Regarding Ivermectin safety, several oral studies have shown it to be safe even when used at daily doses much higher than those approved already. A clinical study has been conducted on COVID-19 patients at Eurnekian Hospital in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The study protocol and its final outcomes are described in this article. Results were compared with published data and data from patients admitted to the hospital receiving other treatments. None of the patient presenting mild symptoms needed to be hospitalized. Only one patient died (0.59 % of all included patients vs. 2.1 % overall mortality for the disease in Argentina today; 3.1 % of hospitalized patients vs. 26.8 % mortality in published data). IDEA protocol appears to be a useful alternative to prevent disease progression of COVID-19 when applied to mild cases and to decrease mortality in patients at all stages of the disease with a favorable risk-benefit ratio.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hector Eduardo Carvallo","author_inst":"Universidad Abierta Interamericana, Eurnekian Public Hospital, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Roberto Raul Hirsch","author_inst":"Universidad de Buenos Aires, Hospital of Infectious Diseases F.J.

We have conducted this study to identify the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in cancer patients with COVID-19 and have explored the relationship of various clinical factors to mortality in our patient cohort. Methods: All active cancer cases presented to the hospital from 8th June to 24 August 2020, and developed symptoms\/ radiological features suspicious of COVID-19 were tested by Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and\/or cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test from a combination of naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical data, treatment details, and outcomes were assessed from the medical records. Results: Of the total 3101 cancer patients admitted to the hospital, 1088 patients were tested and 186 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The CFR in the cohort was 27\/186 (14.5%). Univariate analysis showed that the risk of death was significantly associated with the presence of comorbidities [OR: 2.68; (95%CI: 1.13-6.32); P=0.02], multiple comorbidities [OR: 3.01; (95%CI: 1.02-9.07); P=0.046 for multiple vs. single], and the severity of COVID-19 presentation [OR: 27.48; (95%CI: 5.34-141.49); P=0.0001 for severe vs. not severe]. Among all comorbidities, diabetes [OR: 3.3; (95%CI: 1.35-8.09); P=0.008] and cardiovascular diseases [OR: 3.77; (95%CI: 1.02-13.91); P=0.045] were significant risk factors for death. The receipt of anticancer treatments including chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy within a month before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms had no significant effect on the mortality of cancer patients. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study from India reporting the CFR, clinical associations, and risk factors for mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients. Our study shows that the frequency of COVID-19 in cancer patients is high, and the CFR is 7.6 times more than the national average. Anticancer therapies did not increase the risk of death. Pre-existing comorbidities specially diabetes, multiple comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19 presenting symptoms are significantly linked with COVID-19 related death in the cohort.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anurag Mehta Sr.","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Smreti Vasudevan Sr.","author_inst":"RAJIV GANDHI CANCER INSTITUTE & RESEARCH CENTRE"},{"author_name":"Anuj Parkash Sr.","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Anurag Sharma Jr.","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Tanu Vashist Jr.","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Vidya Krishna Jr.","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20192609","rel_title":"Comorbidities and Susceptibility to COVID-19: A Generalized Gene Set Meta-Analysis Approach","rel_date":"2020-09-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20192609","rel_abs":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 820,000 deaths for almost 24 million confirmed cases worldwide, as of August 27th, 2020, per WHO report. Risk factors include pre-existing conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. There are currently no effective treatments. Our objective was to complete a meta-analysis to identify comorbidity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially conferring increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a computational approach. Results SNP datasets were downloaded from publicly available GWAS catalog for 141 of 258 candidate COVID-19 comorbidities. Gene-level SNP analysis was performed to identify significant pathways by using MAGMA program. SNP annotation program was used to analyze MAGMA-identified genes. COVID-19 comorbidities from six disease categories were found to have significant associated pathways, which were validated by Q-Q plots (p<0.05). The top 250 human mRNA gene expressions for SNP-affected pathways, extracted from publicly accessible gene expression profiles, were evaluated for significant pathways. Protein-protein interactions of identified differentially expressed genes, visualized with STRING program, were significant (p<0.05).

There emerged a need for reliable models to estimate the imminent incidence and overall assessment of the outbreak, in order to develop effective interventions and control strategies. One such vital metrics for monitoring the transmission trends over time is the time-dependent effective reproduction number (Rt). Rt is an estimate of secondary cases caused by an infected individual at a time during the outbreak, given that a certain population proportion is already infected. Misestimated Rt is particularly concerning when probing the association between the changes in transmission rate and the changes in the implemented policies. In this paper, we substantiate the implementation of the instantaneous reproduction number (Rins) method over the conventional method to estimate Rt viz case reproduction number (Rcase), by unmasking the real-time estimation ability of both methodologies using credible datasets. Materials & Methods We employed the daily incidence dataset of COVID-19 for India and high incidence states to estimate Rins and Rcase. We compared the real-time projection obtained through these methods by corroborating those states that are containing a high number of COVID19 cases and are conducting high and efficient COVID-19 testing. The Rins and Rcase were estimated using R0 and EpiEstim packages respectively in R software 4.0.0. Results Although, both the Rins and Rcase for the selected states were higher during the lockdown phases (March 25 - June 1, 2020) and subsequently stabilizes co-equally during the unlock phase (June 1- August 23, 2020), Rins demonstrated variations in accordance with the interventions while Rcase remained generalized and under- & overestimated. A larger difference in Rins and Rcase estimates were also observed for states that are conducting high testing. Conclusion Of the two methods, Rins elucidated a better real-time progression of the COVID-19 outbreak conceptually and empirically, than that of Rcase. However, we also suggest considering the assumptions corroborated in the implementations which may result in misleading conclusions in the real world.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amrutha G.S","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)"},{"author_name":"Abhibhav Sharma","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Anudeepti Sharma","author_inst":"Central University of Rajasthan"},{"author_name":"Marta Camacho","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Oriol Sibila","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Joan Ramon Badia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Marta Lopez","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Kilian Vellve","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Ferran Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rosa Faner","author_inst":"CIBERES"},{"author_name":"Isabel Blanco","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Roger Borras","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alvar Agusti","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERES"},{"author_name":"Eduard Gratacos","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERER"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20194159","rel_title":"Containment to outbreak tipping points in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20194159","rel_abs":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been a cornerstone in managing emergent diseases such as COVID-191-4. However, despite their potential to contain or attenuate the epidemic, the effects of NPIs on disease dynamics are not well understood1,5-7. We show that saturation of NPIs with the increase in infected individuals, an expected consequence of limited contact tracing and healthcare capacities, produces a positive feedback in the disease growth rate and a threshold between two alternative states--containment and outbreak8. These alternative states were previously related with the strength of NPIs but not with the infection number2,9-11. Furthermore, the transition between these states involves an abrupt acceleration in disease dynamics, which we report here for several COVID-19 outbreaks around the world. The consequences of a positive feedback in population dynamics at low numbers is a phenomenon widely studied in ecology--the Allee effect. This effect is a determinant of extinction-outbreak states, geographic synchronization, spatial spread, and the effect of exogenous variables, as vaccination12-15. As countries are relaxing containing measures, recognizing an NPI-induced Allee effect may be essential for deploying containment strategies within and among countries16 and acknowledges the need for early warning indicators of approaching epidemic tipping points17.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matias Arim","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Daniel Herrera-Esposito","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Paola Bermolen","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Cabana","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Maria Ines Fariello","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Lima","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica, Chile"},{"author_name":"Hector Romero","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Kilian Vellve","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Ferran Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rosa Faner","author_inst":"CIBERES"},{"author_name":"Isabel Blanco","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Roger Borras","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alvar Agusti","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERES"},{"author_name":"Eduard Gratacos","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERER"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20193896","rel_title":"Are we there yet?

Accordingly, anti-SARS-Cov2 activity has been reported by CK2 inhibitors in vitro, however any anti-CK2 clinical approach has been assessed in Covid-19 patients so far. Here, we investigated the putative clinical benefit of CIGB-325, an anti-CK2 peptide previously used in cancer patients, which was added to the standard-of-care to treat Covid-19. Methods: A monocentric, randomized standard-of-care controlled trial of intravenous CIGB-325 in adults hospitalized with Covid-19. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to receive CIGB-300 (2.5 mg\/kg\/day during 5-consecutive days) plus standard-of-care (10 patients) or standard-of-care (10 patients). Primary outcomes were time to viral clearance defined as the time (in days) to have nasopharyngeal SARS-Cov2 negative PCR and clinical response. This trial is registered with https:\/\/rpcec.sld.cu\/trials\/RPCEC00000317-En (Code: IG\/CIGB300I\/CV\/2001). Results: Most of the patients had initial positive by chest-computed tomography (CT). CIGB-325 treatment reduced both number of pulmonary lesions and lesion's extent compared to control group in seven days. Taking into account the Covid-19 chest-CT abnormalities, CIGB-325 was also superior to control as well as in terms of proportion of patients with such clinical benefit. Improvement of clinical status was experienced in 50% of patients in the CIGB-325 group and 25% in control. Accordingly, systemic levels of CPK, LDH and CRP were lowered at day 7 by treating with this anti-CK2 peptide. Both therapeutic regimens were similar respect to SARS-Cov2 clearance in nasopharynx swabs over the time. Conclusion: Our study revealed that consecutive-5 day regimen of intravenous CIGB-325 at 2.5 mg\/kg quickly improved the chest-CT outcomes over standard-of-care. This is the first report describing signs of clinical benefit of an anti-CK2 approach in Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leticia R.

Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. Methods: We analyzed the public statements and speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States, Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19 and pandemic response. We used a deductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language used and content discussed. Findings: Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19 made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women leaders spoke more frequently about the impact on local or individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including addressing to: mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their citizen population. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe the COVID-19 virus and response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. Conclusion: While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This language is important because it influences how leaders inspire citizens to adhere to the social contract, and the priorities they highlight and the words they use are meant to resonate with the rest of the nation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara Dada","author_inst":"Vayu Global Health Foundation"},{"author_name":"Henry C Ashworth","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Marlene Joannie Bewa","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Roopa Dhatt","author_inst":"Women in Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carmen Valenzuela","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Immunology"},{"author_name":"Raul Santana","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria M.

In this study, we flushed and collected samples from showers in buildings that had been unoccupied for approximately two months and quantified Legionella pneumophila using a commercial cultivation-based assay. In addition, all bacteria, Legionella spp., L. pneumophila, L. pneumophila serogroup 1, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) were analyzed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Despite low or negligible total chlorine in the stagnant pre-flush water samples, L. pneumophila were not detected by either method; Legionella spp., NTM, and MAC, however, were widespread. Using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), estimated risks of clinical illness from exposure to legionella and MAC via showering were generally low, but the risk of subclinical infection via Legionella spp. could exceed a 10-7 daily risk threshold if just a small fraction ([&ge;]0.1 %) of those legionellae detected by qPCR are highly infectious. Flushing cold and hot water lines rapidly restored a total chlorine (as chloramine) residual and decreased all bacterial gene targets to building inlet water levels within 30 min. Following flushing, the chlorine residual rapidly dissipated and bacterial gene targets rebounded, approaching pre-flush concentrations after 6 to 7 days of stagnation. These results suggest that stagnant water in premise plumbing may contain elevated levels of opportunistic pathogens; flushing, however, can rapidly improve water quality and reduce the health risk but the improvement will be short-lived if building disuse persists.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raymond M Hozalski","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Timothy M LaPara","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Xiaotian Zhao","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Taegyu Kim","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael B Waak","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology & SINTEF Community"},{"author_name":"Tucker Burch","author_inst":"U.S. Department of Agriculture"},{"author_name":"Michael McCarty","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ariadna Garcia","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deyli Chacon","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Delvin Thompson","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Perera","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ariel Gonzalez","author_inst":"International Center of Health La Pradera"},{"author_name":"Rafael Reyes","author_inst":"National Institute of Oncology and Radiobiology"},{"author_name":"Loida Torres","author_inst":"International Center of Health La Pradera"},{"author_name":"Jesus Perez","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yania Valido","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ralysmay Rodriguez","author_inst":"Luis Diaz Soto Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dania M.

The aim was to investigate the frequency and impact of SARS-CoV-2 in parturient women, their partners and newborns. Methods: From April 4th to July 3rd, 2020, all parturient women, their partners and newborns were invited to participate in the study. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission and immediately after delivery a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history, obstetric- and neonatal information were available. Results: A total of 1,361 parturient women, 1,236 partners and 1,342 newborns participated in the study. No associations between previous COVID-19 disease and obstetric- or neonatal complications were found. The adjusted serological prevalence was 2.9% in women and 3.8% in partners. The frequency of blood type A was significantly higher in women with antibodies compared to women without antibodies. 17 newborns had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, and none had IgM antibodies. Full serological data from 1,052 families showed an absolute risk of infection of 0.37 if the partner had antibodies. Only 55% of individuals with antibodies reported symptoms. Conclusion: This large prospective cohort study reports no association between COVID-19 and obstetric- or neonatal complications. The family pattern showed a substantial increase in absolute risk for women living with a partner with antibodies.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pia Egerup","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Line Fich Olsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ann-Marie Hellerung Christiansen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Westergaard","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital and Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University "},{"author_name":"Elin Rosenbek Severinsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathrine Vauvert Roemmelmayer Hviid","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Astrid Marie Kolte","author_inst":"The Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Unit, The Capital Region, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and"},{"author_name":"Amalie Dyhrberg Boje","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marie-Louise Mathilde Friis Bertelsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lisbeth Praetorius","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne Zedeler","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Josefine Reinhardt Nielsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Didi Bang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sine Berntsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jeppe Ethelberg-Findsen","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Ditte Marie Storm","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Judith Bello-Rodriguez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Andreas Ingham","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Olle-Lopez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Eva Hoffmann","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Wilken-Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lone Krebs","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical S"},{"author_name":"Finn Stener Joergensen","author_inst":"Fetal Med.

In this study, we investigated whether NLR levels on admission could predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. A literature search was conducted on 23 July 2020 to retrieve all published articles, including grey literature and preprints, investigating the association between on-admission NLR values and severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). A meta-analysis was performed to determine the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) in NLR values and the pooled risk ratio (RR) for severity and mortality with the 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI). Meta-regression analysis was done to identify potential confounders. A total of 38 articles, including 5699 patients with severity outcomes and 6033 patients with mortality outcomes, were included. The meta-analysis showed that severe and non-survivors of COVID-19 had higher on-admission NLR levels than non-severe and survivors (SMD 0.88; 95%CI 0.72-1.04; I2=75% and 1.68; 95%CI 0.98-2.39; I2=99%, respectively). Regardless of the different NLR cut-off values, the pooled mortality RR in patients with elevated vs. normal NLR levels was 2.75 (95%CI 0.97-7.72). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between NLR levels on admission and COVID-19 severity and mortality was unaffected by age (p=0.236; p=0.213, respectively). High NLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Further studies need to focus on determining the optimal cut-off value for NLR before clinical use.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Martin Simadibrata","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Julius Calvin","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Alya Darin Wijaya","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Naufal Arkan Abiyyu Ibrahim","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Elin Rosenbek Severinsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathrine Vauvert Roemmelmayer Hviid","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Astrid Marie Kolte","author_inst":"The Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Unit, The Capital Region, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and"},{"author_name":"Amalie Dyhrberg Boje","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marie-Louise Mathilde Friis Bertelsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lisbeth Praetorius","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne Zedeler","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Josefine Reinhardt Nielsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Didi Bang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sine Berntsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jeppe Ethelberg-Findsen","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Ditte Marie Storm","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Judith Bello-Rodriguez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Andreas Ingham","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Olle-Lopez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Eva Hoffmann","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Wilken-Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lone Krebs","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical S"},{"author_name":"Finn Stener Joergensen","author_inst":"Fetal Med.

Most countries have implemented some social restrictions to control it. In this work we will use mathematical modelling to assess the current social restrictions in controlling the spread of the disease. We formulate a simple susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model to describe the spread of the coronavirus under social restrictions. The transmission rate in this model is considered variable to catch social restrictions impact. We analyze this model, then fit the model to 160 days induced death data in Italy, Iran, USA, Germany, France, India, Spain and China. we estimate some factors that help in understanding not only the spread of the disease but also assess the current social restriction in controlling this disease. Results: We find a formula for the basic reproduction function (R(t)) and the maximum number of daily infected people. Then estimate the model's parameters with 95% confidence intervals in these countries. We notice that the model has excellent fit to the disease death data in all considered countries except Iran. The percentage of disease death estimated by the model in Germany and France are 3.8% and 1.2% respectively, which are close to reported percentages values. Finally, we estimate the time, after first reported death, spent under social restrictions to reduce the basic reproduction function (R(t)) to one unit. The times to do that in Italy, USA, Germany, France, Spain and China are 40, 50, 34,58, 31, and 15 days respectively. However, the Indian social restrictions in the 160 days were not enough to reach $R(t)=1$. The transmission rate is between 0.1035- 1.6076 and recovery rate is between 0-0.2456. The disease death rates calculated for Germany and France are more realistic than others with average value 0.0023. Extending the same social restrictions for enough time could control the disease in Italy, USA, Germany, France, India, Spain and China. While, more social restrictions are needed to control the disease in India.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mo'tassem Al-arydah","author_inst":"Department of mathematics, Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Khalid Dib","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Hailay Weldegiorgis Berhe","author_inst":"Department of mathematics, Mekelle University"},{"author_name":"Kalyanasundaram Madhu","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Elin Rosenbek Severinsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathrine Vauvert Roemmelmayer Hviid","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Astrid Marie Kolte","author_inst":"The Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Unit, The Capital Region, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and"},{"author_name":"Amalie Dyhrberg Boje","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marie-Louise Mathilde Friis Bertelsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lisbeth Praetorius","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne Zedeler","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Josefine Reinhardt Nielsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Didi Bang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sine Berntsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Hvidovre, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jeppe Ethelberg-Findsen","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Ditte Marie Storm","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Judith Bello-Rodriguez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Andreas Ingham","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Olle-Lopez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Eva Hoffmann","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Wilken-Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lone Krebs","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical S"},{"author_name":"Finn Stener Joergensen","author_inst":"Fetal Med.

Robust humoral anti-viral immune responses have the potential to generate a diverse set of neutralizing antibodies to eliminate viruses and protect against re-infection, transmission, and the evolution of mutations that escape targeted therapeutics. CD73 is present on the majority of human B cells and a subset of T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into adenosine, which can be immunosuppressive. Here we report on CPI-006, a humanized Fc{gamma}R binding-deficient IgG1 anti-CD73 antibody that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and directly activates CD73+ B cells, inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of adenosine. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood from advanced cancer patients receiving CPI-006 revealed evidence of B cell activation, clonal expansion, and development of memory B cells. These immune effects suggested that CPI-006 may be effective at enhancing the magnitude, diversity, and duration of humoral and cellular responses to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We have therefore initiated a Phase 1, single-dose, dose-escalation trial in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety of CPI-006 in COVID-19 patients and to determine effects of CPI-006 on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and the development of memory B cell and T cells. Ten patients have been enrolled in the trial receiving doses of 0.3 mg\/kg or 1.0 mg\/kg. All evaluable patients had low pre-treatment serum levels of anti-viral antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and its receptor binding domain, independent of the duration of their COVID-19 related symptoms prior to enrollment. Anti-viral antibody responses were induced 7 days after CPI-006 treatment and titers continued to rise past Day 56. Increases in the frequency of memory B cells and effector\/memory T cells were observed 28 days after treatment. These preliminary results suggest that CPI-006 activates B cells and may enhance and prolong anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19. This approach may be useful for treating COVID-19 or as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of vaccines.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen B Willingham","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Medicine and Surgery at Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA"},{"author_name":"Craig Hill","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Shenshen Hu","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Jenny A Rudnick","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Barbara Daine-Matsuoka","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica Hsieh","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Haider Mashhedi","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Andrew N Hotson","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Brody","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10003, USA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Marron","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10003, USA"},{"author_name":"Emily Piccione","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Buggy","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Suresh Mahabhashyam","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"William B Jones","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Mehrdad Mobasher","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Richard A Miller","author_inst":"Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Andreas Ingham","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Olle-Lopez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Eva Hoffmann","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Wilken-Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lone Krebs","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical S"},{"author_name":"Finn Stener Joergensen","author_inst":"Fetal Med.

The 95 average number of days from COVID-19 symptom onset to hospital admission was 6.7 days (SD 7). 96 The triad of fever, cough, and dyspnea was present almost uniformly in all 4 clinical phenotypes 97 identified by clustering. Cluster C1 (8,737 patients, 72.4%) was the largest, and comprised patients 98 with the triad alone. Cluster C2 (1,196 patients, 9.9%) also presented with ageusia and anosmia; 99 cluster C3 (880 patients, 7.3%) also had arthromyalgia, headache, and sore throat; and cluster C4 100 (1,253 patients, 10.4%) also manifested with diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Compared to 101 each other, cluster C1 presented the highest in-hospital mortality (24.1% vs. 4.3% vs. 14.7% vs. 102 18.6%; p<0.001). The multivariate study identified phenotypic clusters as an independent factor for 103 in-hospital death. (4) Conclusion: The present study identified 4 phenotypic clusters in patients with 104 COVID-19 pneumonia, which predicted the in-hospital prognosis of clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuel Rubio-Rivas","author_inst":"Bellvitge University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xavier Corbella","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Bellvitge University Hospital, Bellvitge.

We quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater influent and primary settled solids in two wastewater treatment plants to inform the pre-analytical and analytical approaches, and to assess whether influent or solids harbored more viral targets. The primary settled solids samples resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 detection frequencies than the corresponding influent samples. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more readily detected in solids using one-step digital droplet (dd)RT-PCR than with two-step RT-QPCR and two-step ddRT-PCR, likely owing to reduced inhibition with the one-step ddRT-PCR assay. We subsequently analyzed a longitudinal time series of 89 settled solids samples from a single plant for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as coronavirus recovery (bovine coronavirus) and fecal strength (pepper mild mottle virus, PMMoV) controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets N1 and N2 concentrations correlate positively and significantly with COVID-19 clinical confirmed case counts in the sewershed.

Molecular assays on nasopharyngeal swabs remain the cornerstone of COVID-19 diagnostic. Despite massive worldwide efforts, the high technicalities of nasopharyngeal sampling and molecular assays, as well as scarce resources of reagents, limit our testing capabilities. Several strategies failed, to date, to fully alleviate this testing process (e.g. saliva sampling or antigen testing on nasopharyngeal samples). We assessed the performances of a new ELISA microplate assay quantifying SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-antigen) in serum or plasma. Methods. The specificity of the assay, determined on 63 non-COVID patients, was 98.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.3 to 100). Performances were determined on 227 serum samples from 165 patients with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection included in the French COVID and CoV-CONTACT cohorts. Findings. Sensitivity was 132\/142, 93.0% (95% CI, 84.7 to 100), within the first two weeks after symptoms onset. A subset of 73 COVID-19 patients had a serum collected within 24 hours following or preceding a positive nasopharyngeal swab. Among patients with high nasopharyngeal viral loads, Ct value below 30 and 33, only 1\/50 and 4\/67 tested negative for N-antigenemia, respectively. Among patients with a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, 8\/12 presented positive N-antigenemia. The lower respiratory tract was explored for 6\/8 patients, showing positive PCR in 5 cases. Interpretation. This is the first demonstration of the N-antigen antigenemia during COVID-19. Its detection presented a robust sensitivity, especially within the first 14 days after symptoms onset and high nasopharyngeal viral loads. These findings have to be confirmed with higher representation of outpatients. This approach could provide a valuable new option for COVID-19 diagnosis, only requiring a blood draw and easily scalable in all clinical laboratories.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quentin Le Hingrat","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Cedric Laouenan","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Center for Clinical Investigation, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tubiana","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Center for Clinical Investigation, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Lila Bouadma","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Pari"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Tropical and infectious diseases Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, Franc"},{"author_name":"Xavier Duval","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Center for Clinical Investigation, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Houria Ichou","author_inst":"Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Florence Damond","author_inst":"Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Melanie Bertine","author_inst":"Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nabil Benmalek","author_inst":"Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"- French COVID cohort management committee","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"- CoV-CONTACT study group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Christophe Choquet","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Pari"},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Tropical and infectious diseases Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, Franc"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Charpentier","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nadhira Houhou-Fidouh","author_inst":"Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jose Nicolas Alcala Pedrajas","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Pozoblanco Hospital, Pozoblanco (Cordoba), Spain"},{"author_name":"Anabel Martin Urda Diez Canseco","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Palamos Hospital, Palamos (Girona), Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Esteban Giner","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Virgen de los Lirios Hospital, Alcoy (Alicante), Spain"},{"author_name":"Pablo Telleria Gomez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Valladolid Clinical University Hospital, Valladolid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Gomez Huelgas","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Regional University Hospital of Malaga.

However, performance concerns have recently emerged, especially about its sensitivity.. We hypothesized that clinical, biological and radiological characteristics of patients with false negative first RT-PCR testing, despite final diagnosis of COVID19, might differ from patients with positive first RT PCR. Methods: Case \/ control, multicenter study in which COVID19 patients with negative first RT PCR testing were matched to patients with positive first RT PCR on age, gender and initial admission unit (ward or intensive care). Results: Between March 30, and June 22, 2020, 80 cases and 80 controls were included. Neither proportion of death at hospital discharge, nor duration of hospital length stay differed between case and control patients (P=0.80 and P=0.54, respectively). In multivariate analysis, headache (adjusted OR: 0.07 [0.01 ; 0.49]; P=0.007) and fatigue\/malaise (aOR: 0.16 [0.03 ; 0.81]; P=0.027) were associated with lower risk of false negative, whereas platelets > 207.103.mm-3 (aOR: 3.81 [1.10 ; 13.16]; P=0.034) and CRP > 79.8 mg.L-1 (aOR: 4.00 [1.21 ; 13.19]; P=0.023) were associated with higher risk of false negative. Interpretation: Patients with suspected COVID19 and higher inflammatory biological signs expected higher risk of false negative RT PCR testing.

Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 mainly depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells. Therefore, repurposing of known drugs to inhibit S protein-ACE2 interaction could be a quick way to develop effective therapy for COVID-19. Using a high-throughput screening system to investigate the interaction between spike receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and ACE2 extracellular domain, we screened 3581 FDA-approved drugs and natural small molecules and identified ceftazidime as a potent compound to inhibit S-RBD-ACE2 interaction by binding to S-RBD. In addition to significantly inhibit S-RBD binding to HPAEpiC cells, ceftazidime efficiently prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to infect ACE2-expressing 293T cells. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 113.2 M, which is far below the blood concentration (over 300 M) of ceftazidime in patients when clinically treated with recommended dose. Notably, ceftazidime is a drug clinically used for the treatment of pneumonia with minimal side effects compared with other antiviral drugs. Thus, ceftazidime has both anti-bacterial and anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, which should be the first-line antibiotics used for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ChangDong Lin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for

causative agent of COVID-19, is responsible for over 24 million infections and 800,000 deaths since its emergence in December 2019. There are few therapeutic options and no approved vaccines. Here we examine the properties of highly potent human monoclonal antibodies (hu-mAbs) in a mouse adapted model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2 MA). In vitro antibody neutralization potency did not uniformly correlate with in vivo activity, and some hu-mAbs were more potent in combination in vivo. Analysis of antibody Fc regions revealed that binding to activating Fc receptors is essential for optimal protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA. The data indicate that hu-mAb protective activity is dependent on intact effector function and that in vivo testing is required to establish optimal hu-mAb combinations for COVID-19 prevention.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra Schaefer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Frauke Muecksch","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Julio C.C.

Unlike the development of vaccines and new drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2, repurposing of approved or clinically tested drugs can provide an immediate solution.\n\nMethodsWe applied a novel computational approach to search among approved and clinically tested drugs from the DrugBank database. Candidates were selected based on Shannon entropy homology and predefined activity profiles of three small molecules with proven anti-SARS-CoV activity and a published data set. Antiviral activity of a predicted drug, azelastine, was tested in vitro in SARS-CoV-2 infection assays with Vero E6 monkey kidney epithelial cells and reconstituted human nasal tissue. The effect on viral replication was assessed by quantification of viral genomes by droplet digital PCR.\n\nFindingsThe computational approach with four independent queries identified major drug families, most often and in overlapping fashion anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-histamine and neuroactive drugs. Azelastine, an histamine 1 receptor-blocker, was predicted in multiple screens, and based on its attractive safety profile and availability in nasal formulation, was selected for experimental testing. Azelastine significantly reduced cytopathic effect and SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of [~]6 M both in a preventive and treatment setting. Furthermore, azelastine in a commercially available nasal spray tested at 5-fold dilution was highly potent in inhibiting viral propagation in SARS-CoV-2 infected reconstituted human nasal tissue.\n\nInterpretationsAzelastine, an anti-histamine, available in nasal sprays developed against allergic rhinitis may be considered as a topical prevention or treatment of nasal colonization with SARS-CoV-2. As such, it could be useful in reducing viral spread and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Ultimately, its potential benefit should be proven in clinical studies.\n\nFundingprovided by the Hungarian government to the National Laboratory of Virology and by CEBINA GmbH.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Konrat","author_inst":"Department of Structural and Computational Biology, Max F.

Increased availability of genome information of circulating strain in our country will enable to generate selective details in virulent and non virulent markers to prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions. The first case of SARS CoV-2 was detected in Chambal region of Madhya Pradesh state in mid of March 2020 followed by multiple introduction events and expansion of COVID-19 cases within 3 months in this region. We analyzed around 5000 COVID -19 suspected samples referred to Defence Research and Development Establishment, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. A total of 136 cases were found positive over a span of three months period this includes virus introduction to region and further spread. Whole genome sequences employing Oxford nanopore technology were deciphered for 26 SARS-CoV-2 circulating in 10 different districts in Madhya Pradesh State of India. The region witnessed index cases with multiple travel history responsible for introduction of COVID-19 followed by remarkable expansion of virus. The genome wide substitutions including in important viral proteins were observed. The detailed phylogenetic analysis revealed the circulating SARS-CoV-2 clustered in multiple clades A2a, A4 and B. The cluster wise segregation was observed suggesting multiple introduction links and evolution of virus in the region.

Despite over 29 million reported cases and over 900, 000 deaths worldwide as of September 2020, herd immunity and widespread vaccination efforts by many experts are expected to be insufficient in addressing this crisis for the foreseeable future. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatments that can lessen the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in patients who become seriously affected. Many viruses including HIV, the common cold, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use a unique mechanism known as -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to successfully replicate and infect cells in the human host. SARS-CoV (the coronavirus responsible for SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 possess a unique RNA structure, a three-stemmed pseudoknot, that stimulates -1 PRF. Recent experiments identified that small molecules can be introduced as antiviral agents to bind with the pseudoknot and disrupt its stimulation of -1 PRF. If successfully developed, small molecule therapy that targets -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 is an excellent strategy to improve patients prognoses. Crucial to developing these successful therapies is modeling the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot. Following a structural alignment approach, we identify similarities in the -1 PRF pseudoknots of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the original SARS-CoV, as well as a third coronavirus: MERS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In addition, we provide a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot by comprehensively investigating the structural landscape using a hierarchical folding approach. Since understanding the impact of mutations is vital to long-term success of treatments that are based on predicted RNA functional structures, we provide insight on SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot sequence mutations and their effect on the resulting structure and its function.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luke Trinity","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Lance Lansing","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Hosna Jabbari","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Stege","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Pierre T Felix Sr.","author_inst":"Laboratory of Population Genetics and Computational Evolutionary Biology -

Importantly, high proportions of LOX-1+-immature neutrophils are associated with high risks of severe thrombosis.\n\nConclusionsTogether these data suggest that point of care enumeration of LOX-1-immature neutrophils might help distinguish patients at risk of thrombosis complication and most likely to benefit from intensified anticoagulant therapy.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Behazine Combadiere","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Lucille Adam","author_inst":"Inserm - Cimi-paris"},{"author_name":"Paul Quentric","author_inst":"Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Pierre Rosenbaum","author_inst":"Inserm - Cimi-Paris"},{"author_name":"Karim Dorgham","author_inst":"Inserm - Cimi-Paris"},{"author_name":"Olivia Bonduelle","author_inst":"Sorbonne universite"},{"author_name":"Christophe Parizot","author_inst":"Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Delphine Sauce","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"AP_HP"},{"author_name":"Charles-Edouard Luyt","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Boissonnas","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Valerie Pourcher","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"AP-HP\/Sorbonne-universite"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christophe Combadiere","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Paul Lin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Hila Shaim","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Sean G Yates","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"David Marin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Indreshpal Kaur","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sheetal Rao","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mak","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Angelique Lin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Qi Miao","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Jinzhuang Dou","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ken Chen","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Richard Champlin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Shpall","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Rezvani","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.275891","rel_title":"Rational design of a new class of protease inhibitors for the potential treatment of coronavirus diseases","rel_date":"2020-09-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.275891","rel_abs":"The coronavirus main protease, Mpro, is a key protein in the virus life cycle and a major drug target. Based on crystal structures of SARSCoV2 Mpro complexed with peptidomimetic inhibitors, we recognized a binding characteristic shared with proline-containing inhibitors of hepatitis C virus protease. Initial tests showed that this subclass of HCV protease inhibitors indeed exhibited activity against Mpro. Postulating a benefit for a preorganized backbone conformation, we designed new ketoamide-based Mpro inhibitors based on central proline rings. One of the designed compounds, ML1000, inhibits Mpro with low-nanomolar affinity and suppresses SARSCoV2 viral replication in human cells at sub-micromolar concentrations. Our findings identify ML1000 as a promising new pre-organized scaffold for the development of anti-coronavirus drugs.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Westberg","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yichi Su","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Xinzhi Zou","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Lin Ning","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Brett Hurst","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Lin","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Delphine Sauce","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"AP_HP"},{"author_name":"Charles-Edouard Luyt","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Boissonnas","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Valerie Pourcher","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"AP-HP\/Sorbonne-universite"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christophe Combadiere","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Paul Lin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Hila Shaim","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Sean G Yates","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"David Marin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Indreshpal Kaur","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sheetal Rao","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mak","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Angelique Lin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Qi Miao","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Jinzhuang Dou","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ken Chen","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Richard Champlin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Shpall","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Rezvani","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.296889","rel_title":"CROssBAR: Comprehensive Resource of Biomedical Relations with Deep Learning Applications and Knowledge Graph Representations","rel_date":"2020-09-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.296889","rel_abs":"Systemic analysis of available large-scale biological and biomedical data is critical for developing novel and effective treatment approaches against both complex and infectious diseases.

Surveillance systems form the foundation stone of active case finding, testing and contact tracing, which are the key components of the public health response to this novel, emerging infectious disease . There is uncertainty about the true proportion of patients who remain asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at a given time. As per the WHO-China Joint Monitoring Mission Report, and an analysis of 21 published reports, anywhere between 5 and 80 per cent of SARS CoV 2 infected patients have been noted to be asymptomatic. Whereas in India 4197563 cases are positive, in which in West Bengal total 180788 cases (4.04% of Cases of India) positive of COVID 19. In Paschim Medinipur (West Medinipur) district contributing total 5489 cases (3.03% cases of West Bengal). In this scenario, we want to know the status of IgG seroprevalence of SARS CoV 2 among asymptomatic general population, so that we can determine the extent of infection of SARS CoV 2 in general population. Objectives: Primary Objective: To estimate the seroprevalence for SARS CoV 2 infection in the general asymptomatic population at Paschim Medinipur District. Secondary Objectives: To estimate age and sex specific seroprevalence. To determine the socio demographic risk factors for SARS CoV 2 infection; To determine the other risk factors like comorbidities, vaccination status, travel history, contact history etc.; To determine the durability of Immunity (IgG) conferred by natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals previously RTPCR positive. Methodology: It was a cross sectional 30 cluster study among the population of Paschim Medinipur district of West Bengal conducted in last week of July and 1st week of August 2020 among 458 asymptomatic general population and 30 RTPCR positive cases in 30 villages or wards of municipalities. 30 clusters were chosen from list of COVID 19 affected villages\/wards of municipality as per PPS (Probability Proportional to Size) method. Results: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG for SARS CoV 2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive patients found Seronegative. Median of Days between RTPCR test and sero negativity found was 60 with minimum 28 days to maximum 101 days and Range of 73 days and a standard deviation of 19.46. Among risk factors, the risk of having IgG is more in persons having Travel history with odds ratio of 2.99- 95%CI (1.17-7.65) with p-value- 0.02. Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis with Odds ratio of 8.49- 95% CI(1.59-45.19) with p value - 0.003. Occupation as migrant labour with Odds ratio of 5.08- 95% CI(1.96-13.18) with p value of 0.001. H\/O Chicken pox with Odds ratio of 2.15- 95% CI(0.59-7.79) with p value of 0.017. Influenza vaccinated with Odds ratio of 8.07 with 95% CI (0.8-81.48) with a p value of 0.036. Conclusion: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive patients found Seronegative. Median of Days between RTPCR test and sero negativity found was 60 with minimum 28 days to maximum 101 days and Range of 73 days and a standard deviation of 19.46. Those having Travel History and having occupation as Migrant Labourer have significantly higher probability of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. No role has been found of Hydroxychloroquine Medicines as Chemoprophylactic. No durable immunity conferred by natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 mean time to become seronegative after positive RTPCR test 60 days. So there is a chance of reinfection after average 2 months.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Parthasarathi Satpati","author_inst":"Professor & HOD, Department of Microbiology, Medinipur Medical College and Hospital, Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Saumya Sankar Sarangi","author_inst":"Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health - I, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Paschim Medinipur District, Govt. of West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Kripasindhu Gantait","author_inst":"Professor, Department of Medicine, Medinipur Medical College and Hospital, Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Sayantani Endow","author_inst":"Assistant Professor, Department of Microbiology, Medinipur Medical College and Hospital, Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Nimai Chandra Mandal","author_inst":"Chief Medical Officer of Health, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Paschim Medinipur District, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Panchanan Kundu","author_inst":"Principal, Medinipur Medical College and Hospital, Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Subhadip Bhunia","author_inst":"SMO, NPSP Unit, Kharagpur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA , WHO-INDIA"},{"author_name":"Soham Sarangi","author_inst":"2nd Professional MBBS, Medical College, Kolkata, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Volynkin","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Hermann Zellner","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Rengul Cetin-Atalay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maria Martin","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Volkan Atalay","author_inst":"METU"},{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"AP-HP\/Sorbonne-universite"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christophe Combadiere","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Paul Lin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Hila Shaim","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Sean G Yates","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"David Marin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Indreshpal Kaur","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sheetal Rao","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mak","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Angelique Lin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Qi Miao","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Jinzhuang Dou","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ken Chen","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Richard Champlin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Shpall","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Rezvani","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.12.20193094","rel_title":"The Immune-Buffer COVID-19 Exit Strategy that Protects the Elderly","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.12.20193094","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus with frequent symptoms of fever and shortness of breath. COVID-19 has a high mortality rate among elders. The virus has spread world-wide, leading to shut-down of many countries around the globe with the aim of stopping the spread of the disease. To date, there are uncertainties regarding the main factors in the disease spread, so sever social distancing measures and broad testing are required in order to protect the population at risk. With the increasing spread of the virus, there is growing fraction of the general population that may be immune to COVID-19, following infection. This immunised cohort can be uncovered via large-scale screening for the SARS-CoV-2 (Corona) virus and\/or its antibodies. We propose that this immune cohort be deployed as a buffer between the general population and the population most at risk from the disease. Here we show that under a broad range of realistic scenarios deploying such an immunized buffer between the general population and the population at risk may lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of deaths from the disease. This provides an impetus for: screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and\/or its antibodies on the largest scale possible, and organizing at the family, community, national and international levels to protect vulnerable populations by deploying immunized buffers between them and the general population wherever possible.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vered Rom-Kedar","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Omer Yaniv","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Roy Malka","author_inst":"Lynx MD"},{"author_name":"Ehud Shapiro","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Nimai Chandra Mandal","author_inst":"Chief Medical Officer of Health, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Paschim Medinipur District, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Panchanan Kundu","author_inst":"Principal, Medinipur Medical College and Hospital, Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Subhadip Bhunia","author_inst":"SMO, NPSP Unit, Kharagpur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA , WHO-INDIA"},{"author_name":"Soham Sarangi","author_inst":"2nd Professional MBBS, Medical College, Kolkata, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Volynkin","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Hermann Zellner","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Rengul Cetin-Atalay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maria Martin","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Volkan Atalay","author_inst":"METU"},{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"AP-HP\/Sorbonne-universite"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christophe Combadiere","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Paul Lin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Hila Shaim","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Sean G Yates","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"David Marin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Indreshpal Kaur","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sheetal Rao","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Duncan Mak","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Angelique Lin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Qi Miao","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Jinzhuang Dou","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ken Chen","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Richard Champlin","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Shpall","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Rezvani","author_inst":"The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
