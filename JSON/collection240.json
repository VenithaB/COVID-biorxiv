Unlike the development of vaccines and new drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2, repurposing of approved or clinically tested drugs can provide an immediate solution.\n\nMethodsWe applied a novel computational approach to search among approved and clinically tested drugs from the DrugBank database. Candidates were selected based on Shannon entropy homology and predefined activity profiles of three small molecules with proven anti-SARS-CoV activity and a published data set. Antiviral activity of a predicted drug, azelastine, was tested in vitro in SARS-CoV-2 infection assays with Vero E6 monkey kidney epithelial cells and reconstituted human nasal tissue. The effect on viral replication was assessed by quantification of viral genomes by droplet digital PCR.\n\nFindingsThe computational approach with four independent queries identified major drug families, most often and in overlapping fashion anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-histamine and neuroactive drugs. Azelastine, an histamine 1 receptor-blocker, was predicted in multiple screens, and based on its attractive safety profile and availability in nasal formulation, was selected for experimental testing. Azelastine significantly reduced cytopathic effect and SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of [~]6 M both in a preventive and treatment setting. Furthermore, azelastine in a commercially available nasal spray tested at 5-fold dilution was highly potent in inhibiting viral propagation in SARS-CoV-2 infected reconstituted human nasal tissue.\n\nInterpretationsAzelastine, an anti-histamine, available in nasal sprays developed against allergic rhinitis may be considered as a topical prevention or treatment of nasal colonization with SARS-CoV-2. As such, it could be useful in reducing viral spread and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Ultimately, its potential benefit should be proven in clinical studies.\n\nFundingprovided by the Hungarian government to the National Laboratory of Virology and by CEBINA GmbH.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Konrat","author_inst":"Department of Structural and Computational Biology, Max F.

The genomic signature deciphered during the ongoing pandemic period is valuable to understand the virus evolutionary patterns and spread across the globe. Increased availability of genome information of circulating strain in our country will enable to generate selective details in virulent and non virulent markers to prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions. The first case of SARS CoV-2 was detected in Chambal region of Madhya Pradesh state in mid of March 2020 followed by multiple introduction events and expansion of COVID-19 cases within 3 months in this region. We analyzed around 5000 COVID -19 suspected samples referred to Defence Research and Development Establishment, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. A total of 136 cases were found positive over a span of three months period this includes virus introduction to region and further spread. Whole genome sequences employing Oxford nanopore technology were deciphered for 26 SARS-CoV-2 circulating in 10 different districts in Madhya Pradesh State of India. The region witnessed index cases with multiple travel history responsible for introduction of COVID-19 followed by remarkable expansion of virus. The genome wide substitutions including in important viral proteins were observed. The detailed phylogenetic analysis revealed the circulating SARS-CoV-2 clustered in multiple clades A2a, A4 and B. The cluster wise segregation was observed suggesting multiple introduction links and evolution of virus in the region. This is the first comprehensive details of whole genome sequence analysis from central India region, which will add genome wide knowledge towards diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shashi Sharma","author_inst":"Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road, Gwalior  474002 India"},{"author_name":"Paban Kumar Dash","author_inst":"Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Sushil K Sharma","author_inst":"Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Ambuj Srivastava","author_inst":"Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Jyoti S Kumar","author_inst":"Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"B S Karothia","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"K T Chelvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Singh","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Abhay Gupta","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Ram Govind Yadav","author_inst":"Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Ruchi Yadav","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Greshma T S","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Pramod Kushwah","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Ravi Bhushan","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"D P Nagar","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Manvendra Nandan","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Subodh Kumar","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.296491","rel_title":"Levels of genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 virus: reducing speculations about the genetic variability of the virus in South America","rel_date":"2020-09-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.296491","rel_abs":"In this work, we evaluated the levels of genetic diversity in 38 complete Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from six countries in South America, using specific methodologies for paired FST, AMOVA, mismatch, demographic and spatial expansions, molecular diversity and for the time of evolutionary divergence.

Despite over 29 million reported cases and over 900, 000 deaths worldwide as of September 2020, herd immunity and widespread vaccination efforts by many experts are expected to be insufficient in addressing this crisis for the foreseeable future. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatments that can lessen the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in patients who become seriously affected. Many viruses including HIV, the common cold, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use a unique mechanism known as -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to successfully replicate and infect cells in the human host. SARS-CoV (the coronavirus responsible for SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 possess a unique RNA structure, a three-stemmed pseudoknot, that stimulates -1 PRF. Recent experiments identified that small molecules can be introduced as antiviral agents to bind with the pseudoknot and disrupt its stimulation of -1 PRF. If successfully developed, small molecule therapy that targets -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 is an excellent strategy to improve patients prognoses. Crucial to developing these successful therapies is modeling the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot. Following a structural alignment approach, we identify similarities in the -1 PRF pseudoknots of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the original SARS-CoV, as well as a third coronavirus: MERS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In addition, we provide a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot by comprehensively investigating the structural landscape using a hierarchical folding approach. Since understanding the impact of mutations is vital to long-term success of treatments that are based on predicted RNA functional structures, we provide insight on SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot sequence mutations and their effect on the resulting structure and its function.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luke Trinity","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Lance Lansing","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Hosna Jabbari","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Stege","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Pierre T Felix Sr.","author_inst":"Laboratory of Population Genetics and Computational Evolutionary Biology - LaBECom, UNIVISA"},{"author_name":"B S Karothia","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"K T Chelvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Singh","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Abhay Gupta","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Ram Govind Yadav","author_inst":"Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Ruchi Yadav","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Greshma T S","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Pramod Kushwah","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Ravi Bhushan","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"D P Nagar","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Manvendra Nandan","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Subodh Kumar","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.293100","rel_title":"LOX-1+ immature neutrophils predict severe COVID-19 patients at risk of thrombotic complications","rel_date":"2020-09-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.293100","rel_abs":"RationalLymphopenia and neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio may have prognostic value in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity.\n\nObjectiveWe sought to investigate the representation of neutrophil subsets in severe and critical COVID-19 patients based on Intensive Care Units (ICU) and non-ICU admission.\n\nMethodsWe developed a multi-parametric neutrophil profiling strategy based on known neutrophil markers to distinguish COVID-19 phenotypes in critical and severe patients.\n\nResultsOur results showed that 80% of ICU patients develop strong myelemia with CD10-CD64+ immature neutrophils.

The proportion of LOX-1-expressing immature neutrophils positively correlated with clinical severity, with the cytokine storm (IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, TNF), and with intravascular coagulation. Importantly, high proportions of LOX-1+-immature neutrophils are associated with high risks of severe thrombosis.\n\nConclusionsTogether these data suggest that point of care enumeration of LOX-1-immature neutrophils might help distinguish patients at risk of thrombosis complication and most likely to benefit from intensified anticoagulant therapy.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Behazine Combadiere","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Lucille Adam","author_inst":"Inserm - Cimi-paris"},{"author_name":"Paul Quentric","author_inst":"Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Pierre Rosenbaum","author_inst":"Inserm - Cimi-Paris"},{"author_name":"Karim Dorgham","author_inst":"Inserm - Cimi-Paris"},{"author_name":"Olivia Bonduelle","author_inst":"Sorbonne universite"},{"author_name":"Christophe Parizot","author_inst":"Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Delphine Sauce","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"AP_HP"},{"author_name":"Charles-Edouard Luyt","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Boissonnas","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Valerie Pourcher","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"AP-HP\/Sorbonne-universite"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christophe Combadiere","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.275891","rel_title":"Rational design of a new class of protease inhibitors for the potential treatment of coronavirus diseases","rel_date":"2020-09-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.275891","rel_abs":"The coronavirus main protease, Mpro, is a key protein in the virus life cycle and a major drug target.

Surveillance systems form the foundation stone of active case finding, testing and contact tracing, which are the key components of the public health response to this novel, emerging infectious disease . There is uncertainty about the true proportion of patients who remain asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at a given time. As per the WHO-China Joint Monitoring Mission Report, and an analysis of 21 published reports, anywhere between 5 and 80 per cent of SARS CoV 2 infected patients have been noted to be asymptomatic. Whereas in India 4197563 cases are positive, in which in West Bengal total 180788 cases (4.04% of Cases of India) positive of COVID 19. In Paschim Medinipur (West Medinipur) district contributing total 5489 cases (3.03% cases of West Bengal). In this scenario, we want to know the status of IgG seroprevalence of SARS CoV 2 among asymptomatic general population, so that we can determine the extent of infection of SARS CoV 2 in general population. Objectives: Primary Objective: To estimate the seroprevalence for SARS CoV 2 infection in the general asymptomatic population at Paschim Medinipur District. Secondary Objectives: To estimate age and sex specific seroprevalence. To determine the socio demographic risk factors for SARS CoV 2 infection; To determine the other risk factors like comorbidities, vaccination status, travel history, contact history etc.; To determine the durability of Immunity (IgG) conferred by natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals previously RTPCR positive. Methodology: It was a cross sectional 30 cluster study among the population of Paschim Medinipur district of West Bengal conducted in last week of July and 1st week of August 2020 among 458 asymptomatic general population and 30 RTPCR positive cases in 30 villages or wards of municipalities. 30 clusters were chosen from list of COVID 19 affected villages\/wards of municipality as per PPS (Probability Proportional to Size) method. Results: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG for SARS CoV 2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive patients found Seronegative. Median of Days between RTPCR test and sero negativity found was 60 with minimum 28 days to maximum 101 days and Range of 73 days and a standard deviation of 19.46. Among risk factors, the risk of having IgG is more in persons having Travel history with odds ratio of 2.99- 95%CI (1.17-7.65) with p-value- 0.02. Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis with Odds ratio of 8.49- 95% CI(1.59-45.19) with p value - 0.003. Occupation as migrant labour with Odds ratio of 5.08- 95% CI(1.96-13.18) with p value of 0.001. H\/O Chicken pox with Odds ratio of 2.15- 95% CI(0.59-7.79) with p value of 0.017. Influenza vaccinated with Odds ratio of 8.07 with 95% CI (0.8-81.48) with a p value of 0.036. Conclusion: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive patients found Seronegative. Median of Days between RTPCR test and sero negativity found was 60 with minimum 28 days to maximum 101 days and Range of 73 days and a standard deviation of 19.46. Those having Travel History and having occupation as Migrant Labourer have significantly higher probability of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. No role has been found of Hydroxychloroquine Medicines as Chemoprophylactic. No durable immunity conferred by natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 mean time to become seronegative after positive RTPCR test 60 days. So there is a chance of reinfection after average 2 months.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Parthasarathi Satpati","author_inst":"Professor & HOD, Department of Microbiology, Medinipur Medical College and Hospital, Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Saumya Sankar Sarangi","author_inst":"Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health - I, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Paschim Medinipur District, Govt. of West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Kripasindhu Gantait","author_inst":"Professor, Department of Medicine, Medinipur Medical College and Hospital, Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Sayantani Endow","author_inst":"Assistant Professor, Department of Microbiology, Medinipur Medical College and Hospital, Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Nimai Chandra Mandal","author_inst":"Chief Medical Officer of Health, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Paschim Medinipur District, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Panchanan Kundu","author_inst":"Principal, Medinipur Medical College and Hospital, Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Subhadip Bhunia","author_inst":"SMO, NPSP Unit, Kharagpur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA , WHO-INDIA"},{"author_name":"Soham Sarangi","author_inst":"2nd Professional MBBS, Medical College, Kolkata, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Volynkin","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Hermann Zellner","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Rengul Cetin-Atalay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maria Martin","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Volkan Atalay","author_inst":"METU"},{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"AP-HP\/Sorbonne-universite"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christophe Combadiere","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.12.20193094","rel_title":"The Immune-Buffer COVID-19 Exit Strategy that Protects the Elderly","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.12.20193094","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus with frequent symptoms of fever and shortness of breath. COVID-19 has a high mortality rate among elders. The virus has spread world-wide, leading to shut-down of many countries around the globe with the aim of stopping the spread of the disease. To date, there are uncertainties regarding the main factors in the disease spread, so sever social distancing measures and broad testing are required in order to protect the population at risk. With the increasing spread of the virus, there is growing fraction of the general population that may be immune to COVID-19, following infection. This immunised cohort can be uncovered via large-scale screening for the SARS-CoV-2 (Corona) virus and\/or its antibodies. We propose that this immune cohort be deployed as a buffer between the general population and the population most at risk from the disease. Here we show that under a broad range of realistic scenarios deploying such an immunized buffer between the general population and the population at risk may lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of deaths from the disease. This provides an impetus for: screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and\/or its antibodies on the largest scale possible, and organizing at the family, community, national and international levels to protect vulnerable populations by deploying immunized buffers between them and the general population wherever possible.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vered Rom-Kedar","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Omer Yaniv","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Roy Malka","author_inst":"Lynx MD"},{"author_name":"Ehud Shapiro","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Nimai Chandra Mandal","author_inst":"Chief Medical Officer of Health, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Paschim Medinipur District, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Panchanan Kundu","author_inst":"Principal, Medinipur Medical College and Hospital, Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Subhadip Bhunia","author_inst":"SMO, NPSP Unit, Kharagpur, Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, INDIA , WHO-INDIA"},{"author_name":"Soham Sarangi","author_inst":"2nd Professional MBBS, Medical College, Kolkata, West Bengal, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Volynkin","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Hermann Zellner","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Rengul Cetin-Atalay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maria Martin","author_inst":"EMBL-EBI"},{"author_name":"Volkan Atalay","author_inst":"METU"},{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"AP-HP\/Sorbonne-universite"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christophe Combadiere","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.12.20193284","rel_title":"Estimates of outbreak-specific SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological parameters from genomic data","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.12.20193284","rel_abs":"We estimate the basic reproductive number and case counts for 15 distinct SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, distributed across 10 countries and one cruise ship, based solely on phylodynamic analyses of genomic data.

The genomic-based view is arguably less susceptible to biases resulting from differences in testing protocols, testing intensity, and import of cases into the community of interest. In the analyses reported here, the genomic data primarily provides information regarding which samples belong to a particular outbreak. We observe that once these outbreaks are identified, the sampling dates carry the majority of the information regarding the reproductive number. Finally, we provide genome-based estimates of the cumulative case counts for each outbreak, which allow us to speculate on the amount of unreported infections within the populations housing each outbreak.

Semiparametric spatial temporal models were fitted to the number of weekly confirmed cases as an outcome data, with time and location as independent variables. Results: The study found significant main effect of location and time with the two interacting. The spatial distribution of COVID-19 showed major cities being at greater risk than rural areas. Over time the COVID-19 risk was increasing then decreasing in most districts with the rural districts being consistently at lower risk. Conclusion. Future or present strategies to avert the spread of COVID-19 should target major cities by limiting international exposure.

Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of temperature, humidity, UV radiation, and population density with estimates of transmission rate (R). Using data from the United States of America, we explore correlates of transmission across USA states using comparative regression and integrative epidemiological modelling. We find that policy intervention (`lockdown') and reductions in individuals' mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but in their absence lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioural changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of SARS-CoV-2, its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas P Smith","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Seth Flaxman","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Amanda S Gallinat","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Sylvia P Kinosian","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Stemkovski","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"H Juliette T Unwin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Tristem","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"William D Pearse","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Volkan Atalay","author_inst":"METU"},{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"AP-HP\/Sorbonne-universite"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christophe Combadiere","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.12.20191973","rel_title":"Inequality in access to health and care services during lockdown - Findings from the COVID-19 survey in five UK national longitudinal studies","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.12.20191973","rel_abs":"Background: Access to health services and adequate care is influenced by sex, ethnicity, socio-economic position (SEP) and burden of co-morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. Methods: Participants were from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). A web and telephone-based survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received during the UK COVID-19 national lockdown. Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study-design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, keyworker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts and meta-regression evaluated the effect of age as a moderator. Findings: 14891 participants were included. Females (OR 1.40, 95% confidence interval [1.27,1.55]) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84 [1.65-2.05]) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR approx. 2.00, all p<0.002). Age was not independently associated with either outcome in meta-regression. SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Interpretation: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly females, ethnic-minorities and those with chronic illnesses. Public health authorities need to implement urgent policies to ensure equitable access to health and care for all in preparation for a second wave.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Constantin-Cristian Topriceanu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wong","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"James C Moon","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Alun Hughes","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"David Bann","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Nishi Chaturvedi","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Praveetha Patalay","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Conti","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Captur","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Tristem","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"William D Pearse","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Volkan Atalay","author_inst":"METU"},{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"AP-HP\/Sorbonne-universite"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christophe Combadiere","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20193680","rel_title":"Lack of consideration of sex and gender in clinical trials for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20193680","rel_abs":"Sex and gender differences impact the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality.

The result suggests that differential ZAP activity may be a major determinant of the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Africa, Asia, and pools of asymptomatic patients had I_CpG signature evidence of high ZAP activity, while SARS-CoV-2 sequences from North America and Intensive Care Unit or Deceased patients had I_CpG signature of low ZAP activity. ZAP activity is linked to the interferon system. Low ZAP activity may be part of the explanation for the increased morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly and with comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. It may also provide some insight into the discrepancies between invitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of candidate therapies and performance in clinical trials.

Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes may facilitate tailored therapy and improve outcomes. Objective: Identify specific clinical phenotypes across COVID-19 patients and compare admission characteristics and outcomes. Design, Settings, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of 1,022 COVID-19 patient admissions from 14 Midwest U.S. hospitals between March 7, 2020 and August 25, 2020. Methods: Ensemble clustering was performed on a set of 33 vitals and labs variables collected within 72 hours of admission. K-means based consensus clustering was used to identify three clinical phenotypes. Principal component analysis was performed on the average covariance matrix of all imputed datasets to visualize clustering and variable relationships. Multinomial regression models were fit to further compare patient comorbidities across phenotype classification. Multivariable models were fit to estimate the association between phenotype and in-hospital complications and clinical outcomes. Main outcomes and measures: Phenotype classification (I, II, III), patient characteristics associated with phenotype assignment, in-hospital complications, and clinical outcomes including ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Results: The database included 1,022 patients requiring hospital admission with COVID-19 (median age, 62.1 [IQR: 45.9-75.8] years; 481 [48.6%] male, 412 [40.3%] required ICU admission, 437 [46.7%] were white). Three clinical phenotypes were identified (I, II, III); 236 [23.1%] patients had phenotype I, 613 [60%] patients had phenotype II, and 173 [16.9%] patients had phenotype III. When grouping comorbidities by organ system, patients with respiratory comorbidities were most commonly characterized by phenotype III (p=0.002), while patients with hematologic (p<0.001), renal (p<0.001), and cardiac (p<0.001) comorbidities were most commonly characterized by phenotype I. The adjusted odds of respiratory (p<0.001), renal (p<0.001), and metabolic (p<0.001) complications were highest for patients with phenotype I, followed by phenotype II. Patients with phenotype I had a far greater odds of hepatic (p<0.001) and hematological (p=0.02) complications than the other two phenotypes. Phenotypes I and II were associated with 7.30-fold (HR: 7.30, 95% CI: (3.11-17.17), p<0.001) and 2.57-fold (HR: 2.57, 95% CI: (1.10-6.00), p=0.03) increases in the hazard of death, respectively, when compared to phenotype III. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19, three clinical phenotypes were identified. Future research is urgently needed to determine the utility of these phenotypes in clinical practice and trial design.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth R Lusczek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nicholas E Ingraham","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Basil Karam","author_inst":"Medical College of Wisconsin"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Proper","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Lianne Siegel","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Erika Helgeson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Sahar Lotfi-Emran","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Emily J.

Severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care was reported in up to 5% of cases. There is, however, limited information available in Mexico. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, and outcomes in a COVID-19 cohort attended to from March to May 2020 in our RICU. In addition, we explored the association of clinical variables with mortality. Methods: The first consecutive patients admitted to the RICU from March 3, 2020, to Jun 24, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 were investigated. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a logistic regression model. The survival endpoint was mortality at discharge from the RICU. Results: Data from 68 consecutive patients were analyzed. Thirty-eight patients survived, and 30 died (mortality: 44.1 %). Of the 16 predictive variables analyzed, only 6 remained significant in the multivariate analysis [OR (95% confidence interval)]: no acute kidney injury (AKI)\/AKI 1: [.61 (.001;.192)]; delta lymphocyte count: [.061 (.006;.619)]; delta ventilatory ratio: [8.19 (1.40;47.8)]; norepinephrine support at admission: [34.3 (2.1;550)]; body mass index: [1.41 (1.09;1.83)]; and bacterial coinfection: [18.5 (1.4;232)]. Conclusions: We report the characteristics and outcome of patients with ARDS and COVID-19. We found six independent factors associated with the mortality risk: delta lymphocyte count, delta ventilatory ratio, BMI, norepinephrine support, no AKI\/AKI 1, and bacterial coinfection .","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"GUSTAVO LUGO GOYTIA","author_inst":"INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE ENFERMEDADES RESPIRATORIAS ISMAEL COSIO VILLEGAS"},{"author_name":"Carmen Hernandez-Cardenas,","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Carlos Torruco-Sotelo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Felipe Jurado","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Hector Serna-secundino","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Cristina Aguilar","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Jose Garcia-Olanzaran","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Diana Hernandez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Emma Jones","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael Usher","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Chipman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"R.

Understanding the role of weather factors in COVID-19 in Brazil is helpful in the long-term mitigation strategy of COVID-19 in other tropical countries because Brazil experienced early large-scale outbreak among tropical countries. Recent COVID-19 studies indicate that relevant weather factors such as temperature, humidity, UV Index (UVI), precipitation, ozone, pollution and cloud cover may influence the spread of COVID-19. Yet, the magnitude and direction of those associations remain inconclusive. Furthermore, there is only limited research exploring the impact of these weather factors in a tropical country like Brazil. In this observational study, we outline the roles of 7 relevant weather factors including temperature, humidity, UVI, precipitation, ozone, pollution (visibility) and cloud cover in COVID-19 deaths in Brazil. Methods: We use a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 27 administrative regions in Brazil across 182 days (n=3882) and analyze the role of relevant weather factors by using daily cumulative COVID-19 deaths in Brazil as the dependent variable. We carry out robustness checks using case-fatality-rate (CFR) as the dependent variable. Findings: We control for all time-fixed and various time-varying region-specific factors confounding factors. We observe a significant negative association of COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate in Brazil with weather factors - UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover. Specifically, a unit increase in UVI, maximum temperature, and ozone independently associate with 6.0 percentage points [p<0.001], 1.8 percentage points [p<0.01] and 0.3 percentage points [p<0. 1] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate. Further, a unit percentage increase in cloud cover associates with a decline of 0.148 percentage points [p<0.05] in COVID-19 deaths growth rate. Surprisingly, contrary to other studies, we do not find evidence of any association between COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate and humidity, visibility and precipitation. We find our results to be consistent even when we use the CFR as the dependent variable. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover in mitigating COVID-19 deaths, even in a tropical country like Brazil. We observe these results to be consistent across various model specifications, especially for UVI and cloud cover, even after incorporating additional time-varying weather parameters such as dewpoint, pressure, wind speed and wind gust. These results could guide health-related policy decision making in Brazil as well as similar tropical countries.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Kalippurayil Moozhipurath","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Carmen Hernandez-Cardenas,","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Carlos Torruco-Sotelo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Felipe Jurado","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Hector Serna-secundino","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Cristina Aguilar","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Jose Garcia-Olanzaran","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Diana Hernandez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Emma Jones","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael Usher","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Chipman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"R.

At the scale of a global pandemic, the co-occurrence of natural disasters is inevitable. However, the impact of natural disasters on the spread of COVID-19 has not been extensively evaluated using agent based epidemiology models. Methods: We create an agent-based epidemiology model based on both COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological data and geographic data. We first model 35 scenarios with varying natural disaster timing and duration for a COVID-19 outbreak in a theoretical region. We then evaluate the potential effect of an eruption of Vesuvius volcano on the spread of COVID-19 in Campania, Italy. Our objective is to determine if the occurrence of a natural disaster during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase infection cases and disease related fatalities. Results: In a majority of cases, the occurrence of a natural disaster increases the number of disease related fatalities. When the natural disaster occurs at the beginning of the outbreak within a given region, there is little to no increase in the progression of disease spread. However, the occurrence of a natural disaster close to the peak of infections may increase the number of fatalities by more than five-fold. In a theoretical test case, for a natural disaster that occurred fifty days after first infection case, the median increase in fatalities is 2%, 59%, and 180% for a 2, 14, and 31-day long natural disaster respectively, when compared to the no natural disaster scenario. Conclusion: We propose that the compound risk from natural disasters is greatest in the case of already widespread disease outbreak. The key risk factors for increase in spread of infection and disease related fatalities are the timing of the natural disaster relative to the peak in infections and the duration of the natural disaster.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Lekaashree Rambabu","author_inst":"National Health Service Tayside"},{"author_name":"Carlos Torruco-Sotelo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Felipe Jurado","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Hector Serna-secundino","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Cristina Aguilar","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Jose Garcia-Olanzaran","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Diana Hernandez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Emma Jones","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael Usher","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Chipman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"R.

Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemic first wave. However, there is a need to understand this further for specific groups, including those diagnosed with a personality disorder who might have particular vulnerabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with personality disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st May 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with personality disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with personality disorder over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. Liaison and Older Adult teams showed the largest drop in caseloads, whereas Early Intervention in Psychosis service caseloads remained the same. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was a 28% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eleanor Nuzum","author_inst":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Martin","author_inst":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Broadbent","author_inst":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Robert Stewart","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Hector Serna-secundino","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Cristina Aguilar","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Jose Garcia-Olanzaran","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Diana Hernandez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Emma Jones","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael Usher","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Chipman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"R.

Digital contact tracing (DCT) uses tools such as cell-phone applications to improve tracing speed and reach. We model the impact of DCT on the spread of the virus for a large epidemiological parameter space consistent with current literature on SARS-CoV-2. We also model DCT in combination with random testing (RT) and social distancing (SD). Modelling is done with two independently developed individual-based (stochastic) models that use the Monte Carlo technique, benchmarked against each other and against two types of deterministic models. For current best estimates of the number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers (approximately 40\\%), their contagiousness (similar to that of symptomatic carriers), the reproductive number before interventions (R0 at least 3) we find that DCT must be combined with other interventions such as SD and\/or RT to push the reproductive number below one. At least 60\\% of the population would have to use the DCT system for its effect to become significant. On its own, DCT cannot bring the reproductive number below 1 unless nearly the entire population uses the DCT system and follows quarantining and testing protocols strictly. For lower uptake of the DCT system, DCT still reduces the number of people that become infected. When DCT is deployed in a population with an ongoing outbreak where O(0.1\\%) of the population have already been infected, the gains of the DCT intervention come at the cost of requiring up to 15% of the population to be quarantined (in response to being traced) on average each day for the duration of the epidemic, even when there is sufficient testing capability to test every traced person.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tina R Pollmann","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Julia Pollmann","author_inst":"University clinic Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Wiesinger","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Christian Haack","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Lolian Shtembari","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Physics"},{"author_name":"Andrea Turcati","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Birgit Neumair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Stephan Meighen-Berger","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Zattera","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Matthias Neumair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Uljana Apel","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Augustine Okolie","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Johannes Mueller","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, Helmholtz Center Munich"},{"author_name":"Stefan Schoenert","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Elisa Resconi","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Monica I Lupei","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Tignanelli","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20186692","rel_title":"Secondary traumatic stress and burnout in healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20186692","rel_abs":"Aims: To assess the level of professional burnout and secondary traumatic stress, and to identify potential risk or protective factors among health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study, based on an online survey, collected demographic data and mental distress outcomes from 184 HCWs from May 1st, 2020, to June,15th, 2020, from 45 different countries. The degree of secondary traumatization was assessed using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS), the degrees of perceived stress and burnout were assessed with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk and protective factors for STS. Results: 184 HCWs (M=90; Age mean: 46.45; SD:11.02) completed the survey. A considerable proportion of HCWs had symptoms of secondary traumatic stress (41.3%), emotional exhaustion (56.0%), and depersonalization (48.9%). The prevalence of secondary traumatic stress in frontline HCWs was 47.5% while in HCWs working in other units it was 30.3% (p<.023); additionally, the prevalence of the same outcome was 67.1% for the HCWs exposed to patients' death and 32.9% for those HCWs which were not exposed to the same condition (p<.001). In stepwise multiple regression analysis, perceived stress, emotional exhaustion and exposure to patients' death remained as significant predictors in the final model for secondary traumatic stress (adjusted R2 =0.537, p<0.001). Conclusions: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs facing patients' physical pain, psychological suffering, and death are more likely to develop secondary traumatization.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Marzetti","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Guido Vagheggini","author_inst":"Auxilium Vitae Rehabilitation Centre"},{"author_name":"Ciro Conversano","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Mario Miccoli","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Angelo Gemignani","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Ciacchini","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Panait","author_inst":"Fondazione Volterra Ricerche ONLUS"},{"author_name":"Graziella Orru","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Zattera","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Matthias Neumair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Uljana Apel","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Augustine Okolie","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Johannes Mueller","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, Helmholtz Center Munich"},{"author_name":"Stefan Schoenert","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Elisa Resconi","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Monica I Lupei","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Tignanelli","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Duraipandian Thavaselvam","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"},{"author_name":"Devendra Kumar Dubey","author_inst":"COVID-19 Diagnosis Task Force Virology Division Defence Research Development Establishment Jhansi Road Gwalior 474002 India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20193615","rel_title":"Alternative or Complementary Role of Serological Rapid Antibody Test in the Management of Possible COVID-19 Cases","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20193615","rel_abs":"Background: Although the gold diagnostic method for COVID-19 is accepted as the detection of viral particles by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serology testing for SARS-CoV-2 is at increased demand. A primary aim for utilization of serological tests are to better quantify the number of COVID-19 cases including those RT-PCR samples were negative but showing clinical and radiological signs of COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to report the features of the patients that were diagnosed and treated as possible COVID-19 cases whose multiple nasopharyngeal swab samples were negative by RT-PCR but serological IgM\/IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by rapid antibody test. Method: We retrospectively analyzed eighty suspected COVID-19 cases that have at least two negative consecutive COVID-19 PCR test and were subjected to serological rapid antibody test. Result: The specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as positive in twenty-two patients. The mean age of patient group was 63.2+-13.1 years old with male \/female ratio 11\/11. Cough was the most common symptom with 90.9%. Most common presenting chest CT findings were bilateral ground glass opacities (77.2%) and alveolar consolidations (50.09%). The mean duration from symptom initiation to hospital admission, to hospitalization, to treatment initiation and to detection of antibody positivity were 8.6 +- 7.2, 11.2 +- 5.4, 7.9 +- 3.2 and 24 +- 17 days, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the feasibility of COVID-19 diagnosis based on rapid antibody test in the cases of patients whose RT-PCR samples were negative. We suggest that the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with rapid antibody test should be included in the diagnostic algorithm in suspected COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatma Yildirim","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary&Critical Care Medicine, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Research and Education Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Pinar Yildiz Gulhan","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Duzce University, Faculty of Medicine, Duzce, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Ozlem Ercen Diken","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Adana Research and Education Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Adana, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Aylin Capraz","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Sabuncuoglu Serefeddin Research and Education Hospital, Amasya University, Amasya, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Meltem Simsek","author_inst":"Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Research and Education Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Berna Botan Yildirim","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Research and Education Hospital of Baskent University, Konya, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Muhammet Ridvan Taysi","author_inst":"Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Research and Education Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sakine Yilmaz Ozturk","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Vezirkopru State Hospital, Samsun, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Nurcan Demirtas","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Kumluca State Hospital, Antalya, Turkey.

Traditional methods relying on qPCR or sequencing are difficult to implement in settings with limited resources necessitating the development of accurate alternative testing strategies that perform robustly. Here, we present FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that employs a direct Cas9 based enzymatic readout for detecting nucleotide sequences and identifying nucleobase identity without the requirement of trans-cleavage activity of reporter molecules. We demonstrate that FELUDA is 100% accurate in detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) including heterozygous carriers of a mutation and present a simple design strategy in the form of a web-tool, JATAYU, for its implementation. FELUDA is semi quantitative, can be adapted to multiple signal detection platforms and can be quickly designed and deployed for versatile applications such as infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Using a lateral flow readout within 1h, FELUDA shows 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity across all range of viral loads in clinical samples. In combination with RT-RPA and a smartphone application True Outcome Predicted via Strip Evaluation (TOPSE), we present a prototype for FELUDA for CoV-2 detection at home.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohd.

In this research, we report sensing of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus in seconds via an electrochemical platform consisting of gold micropillar array electrodes decorated with reduced graphene oxide and functionalized with recombinant viral antigens. The array electrodes are fabricated by Aerosol Jet (AJ) nanoparticle 3D printing, where gold nanoparticles (3-5nm) are assembled in 3D space, sintered, and integrated with a microfluidic device. The device is shown to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein and its receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at concentrations down to 1pM via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and read by a smartphone-based user interface. In addition, the sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low-pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive testing of multiple antibody samples using the same sensor. The detection time for the two antibodies tested in this work is 11.5 seconds. S1 protein sensing of its antibodies is specific, which cross-reacts neither with other antibodies nor with proteins such as Nucleocapsid antibody and Interleukin-6 protein. The proposed sensing platform is generic and can also be used for the rapid detection of biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika, which will benefit the public health.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Azahar Ali","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Chunshan Hu","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Sanjida Jahan","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Bin Yuan","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Sadeq Saleh","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Enguo Ju","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shou-Jiang Gao","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rahul P Panat","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Saumya Sharma","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sunaina Singh","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sundaram Acharya","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepanjan Paul","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Poorti Kathpalia","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Meghali Aich","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Paras Sehgal","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gyan Ranjan","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rahul C Bhoyar","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"- Indian CoV2 Genomics & Genetic Epidemiology (IndiCovGEN) Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Khushboo Singhal","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Harsha Lad","author_inst":"CSIR-Sickle Cell Anemia Mission Laboratory, Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, Bilaspur 495001, Chhattisgarh, India"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Kumar Patra","author_inst":"CSIR-Sickle Cell Anemia Mission Laboratory, Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, Bilaspur 495001, Chhattisgarh, India"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110029, India"},{"author_name":"Giriraj Ratan Chandak","author_inst":"CSIR-Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Uppal Road, Hyderabad, Telengana 500007"},{"author_name":"Bala Pesala","author_inst":"CSIR-Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Debojyoti Chakraborty","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maiti","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20193805","rel_title":"Genome sequencing of sewage detects regionally prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20193805","rel_abs":"Viral genome sequencing has guided our understanding of the spread and extent of genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes are usually sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs of individual patients to track viral spread. Recently, RT-qPCR of municipal wastewater has been used to quantify the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in several regions globally. However, metatranscriptomic sequencing of wastewater can be used to profile the viral genetic diversity across infected communities. Here, we sequenced RNA directly from sewage collected by municipal utility districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to generate complete and near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The major consensus SARS-CoV-2 genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region. Using a pipeline for single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling in a metagenomic context, we characterized minor SARS-CoV-2 alleles in the wastewater and detected viral genotypes which were also found within clinical genomes throughout California. Observed wastewater variants were more similar to local California patient-derived genotypes than they were to those from other regions within the US or globally. Additional variants detected in wastewater have only been identified in genomes from patients sampled outside of CA, indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing. These results demonstrate that epidemiological surveillance through wastewater sequencing can aid in tracking exact viral strains in an epidemic context.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Crits-Christoph","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Rose S Kantor","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Matthew R Olm","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Oscar N Whitney","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Basem Al-Shayeb","author_inst":"Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Yue C Lou","author_inst":"Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Avi Flamholz","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lauren C Kennedy","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hannah Greenwald","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adrian Hinkle","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Hetzel","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sara Spitzer","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jeffery Koble","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Asako Tan","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Fred Hyde","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Gary Schroth","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Scott Kuersten","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jillian F Banfield","author_inst":"Innovative Genomics Institute, Berkeley, CA, 94704, USA"},{"author_name":"Kara L Nelson","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Harsha Lad","author_inst":"CSIR-Sickle Cell Anemia Mission Laboratory, Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, Bilaspur 495001, Chhattisgarh, India"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Kumar Patra","author_inst":"CSIR-Sickle Cell Anemia Mission Laboratory, Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, Bilaspur 495001, Chhattisgarh, India"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110029, India"},{"author_name":"Giriraj Ratan Chandak","author_inst":"CSIR-Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Uppal Road, Hyderabad, Telengana 500007"},{"author_name":"Bala Pesala","author_inst":"CSIR-Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Debojyoti Chakraborty","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maiti","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20188334","rel_title":"Self-collected Saline Gargle Samples as an Alternative to Healthcare Worker Collected Nasopharyngeal Swabs for COVID-19 Diagnosis in Outpatients","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20188334","rel_abs":"Background: We assessed the performance, stability, and user acceptability of swab-independent self-collected saliva and saline mouth rinse\/gargle sample types for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in adults and school-aged children. Methods: Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. A portion of participants were also asked about sample acceptability. Samples underwent molecular testing using multiple assays. Saline mouth rinse\/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day one, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Results: 50 participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse\/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39\/40) while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26\/33). Both saline mouth rinse\/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse\/gargle samples had the highest (mean 4.9) and HCW-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean 3.1).
