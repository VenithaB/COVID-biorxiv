While a select agent designation has not been made for SARS-CoV-2, closely related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses are classified as Risk Group 3 select agents, which restricts use of the live viruses to BSL-3 facilities. Such BSL-3 classification make SARS-CoV-2 research inaccessible to the majority of functioning research laboratories in the US; this becomes problematic when the collective scientific effort needs to be focused on such in the face of a pandemic. In this work, we assessed the four structural proteins from SARS-CoV-2 for their ability to form viruslike particles (VLPs) from human cells to form a competent system for BSL-2 studies of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we provide methods and resources of producing, purifying, fluorescently and APEX2-labeling of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs for the evaluation of mechanisms of viral budding and entry as well as assessment of drug inhibitors under BSL-2 conditions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caroline B.

Using an image-based high-content screen, we identified two thiopurines, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo), that selectively disrupted the processing and accumulation of IAV glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Selective disruption of IAV glycoprotein processing and accumulation by 6-TG and 6-TGo correlated with unfolded protein response (UPR) activation and HA accumulation could be partially restored by the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA). Chemical inhibition of the integrated stress response (ISR) restored accumulation of NA monomers in the presence of 6-TG or 6-TGo, but did not restore NA glycosylation or oligomerization. Thiopurines inhibited replication of the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), which also correlated with UPR\/ISR activation and diminished accumulation of ORF1ab and nucleocapsid (N) mRNAs and N protein, which suggests broader disruption of coronavirus gene expression in ER-derived cytoplasmic compartments. The chemically similar thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) had little effect on the UPR and did not affect IAV or HCoV-OC43 replication. Consistent with reports on other CoV Spike (S) proteins, ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused UPR activation. 6-TG treatment inhibited accumulation of full length S0 or furin-cleaved S2 fusion proteins, but spared the S1 ectodomain. DBeQ, which inhibits the p97 AAA-ATPase required for retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins during ER-associated degradation (ERAD) restored accumulation of S0 and S2 proteins in the presence of 6-TG, suggesting that 6-TG induced UPR accelerates ERAD-mediated turnover of membrane-anchored S0 and S2 glycoproteins. Taken together, these data indicate that 6-TG and 6-TGo are effective host-targeted antivirals that trigger the UPR and disrupt accumulation of viral glycoproteins. Importantly, our data demonstrate for the first time the efficacy of these thiopurines in limiting IAV and HCoV-OC43 replication in cell culture models.\n\nIMPORTANCESecreted and transmembrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are folded and modified prior to transport. During infection, many viruses burden the ER with the task of creating and processing viral glycoproteins that will ultimately be incorporated into viral envelopes. Some viruses refashion the ER into replication compartments where viral gene expression and genome replication take place. This viral burden on the ER can trigger the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), which attempts to increase the protein folding and processing capacity of the ER to match the protein load. Much remains to be learned about how viruses co-opt the UPR to ensure efficient synthesis of viral glycoproteins. Here, we show that two FDA-approved thiopurine drugs, 6-TG and 6-TGo, induce the UPR in a manner that impedes viral glycoprotein accumulation for enveloped influenza viruses and coronaviruses. These drugs may impede the replication of viruses that require precise tuning of the UPR to support viral glycoprotein synthesis for the successful completion of a replication cycle.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick D Slaine","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Mariel Kleer","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Brett Duguay","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Eric Stanley Pringle","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Eileigh Kadijk","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Shan Ying","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Aruna D Balgi","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Michel Roberge","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Craig McCormick","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Denys A Khaperskyy","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.30.321059","rel_title":"Transcriptional differences for COVID-19 Disease Map genes between males and females indicate a different basal immunophenotype relevant to the disease","rel_date":"2020-10-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.30.321059","rel_abs":"Worldwide COVID-19 epidemiology data indicate clear differences in disease incidence among sex and age groups.

The present study was conducted to gain a preliminary understanding of the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic specifically for dreamers, i.e., undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. as minors. A population of about 150 dreamers currently enrolled at a public university in Delaware were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey contained questions about demographics, mental health, academics, immigration, COVID-19 infection, and unemployment, in addition to mental health screens for anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and stress (PSS-10). In total, 109 dreamers completed the survey. We observed remarkably high clinical levels of anxiety and depression: 47% of the dreamers met the clinical cutoff for anxiety, 63% met the cutoff for depression, and 67% (2 in 3) met the cutoff for anxiety and\/or depression. Rates of anxiety and depression in our sample were significantly higher than those recently reported for college students overall, suggesting that dreamers may be experiencing a more severe mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that pandemic-induced concerns about finances, COVID-19 infection, immigration, and unemployment (among other factors) were associated with greater anxiety, stress, and depression among the dreamers in our sample. The present findings are consistent with recent predictions by social scientists that the COVID-19 pandemic would have a disproportionately negative impact on the mental health of undocumented immigrants.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jarid Goodman","author_inst":"Delaware State University"},{"author_name":"Sharron Xuanren Wang","author_inst":"Delaware State University"},{"author_name":"Rubi A Guadarrama Ornelas","author_inst":"Delaware State University"},{"author_name":"Marina Hernandez Santana","author_inst":"Delaware State University"},{"author_name":"Manish Soneja","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Michel Roberge","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Craig McCormick","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Denys A Khaperskyy","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.28.20202796","rel_title":"COVID-19 Related Deaths Among Doctors In India","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.28.20202796","rel_abs":"Background: India has the most number of COVID-19 cases currently in the world, second only to the USA. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused high mortality not only in patients but also health care providers. In this paper, our aim is to analyze the cases of deaths among Indian doctors due to COVID-19 infection. Methods: The details of data were taken from the list of the deceased doctors in India due to COVID-19 infection, which was compiled by the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the top body of Indian doctors practicing modern allopathic medicine. The key data fields of age, specialty, and geographical location of the deceased doctors were extracted from the given list, and analysis was performed. Results: A total of 382 COVID-related deaths and 2174 infections were reported amongst doctors in India till 10 September 2020, with a case fatality rate of 16.7% among Indian doctors, which was ten times the CFR of 1.7% in the general population. Among the practicing doctors, after excluding the resident doctors and house surgeons, the CFR was 36.4%, which is almost 22 times more than what was seen in Indian general population. The average age of COVID-related deaths in Indian doctors was 60.8 years, with a median age of 60; 62% of deaths among doctors were in the above 60 years, age group. The maximum number of deceased doctors were amongst general practitioners 225(58.9%). Among the specialists, most deaths were seen in paediatricians 26(6.8%), medical specialists 24(6.3%), general surgeons 22(5.8%), obstetricians & gynecologists 16(4.2%), and anesthesiologists 14(3.7%). The highest COVID-19 related deaths in doctors were seen in the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra in that order. Conclusions: The mortality rate is very high among doctors in India compared to the general population. The average age of COVID-19 related death was 60 years among doctors. General practitioners and 60 years+ doctors are at a much higher risk of mortality among the doctors. The states with the high number of COVID-19 cases in India, also had a higher number of doctor deaths.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aanandita Kapoor","author_inst":"TISB, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Krishan Mohan Kapoor","author_inst":"Fortis Hospital, Mohali"},{"author_name":"Rubi A Guadarrama Ornelas","author_inst":"Delaware State University"},{"author_name":"Marina Hernandez Santana","author_inst":"Delaware State University"},{"author_name":"Manish Soneja","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Michel Roberge","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Craig McCormick","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Denys A Khaperskyy","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.26.20202283","rel_title":"Combination therapy with tocilizumab and corticosteroids for aged patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a single-center retrospective study.","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.26.20202283","rel_abs":"Background: The role of combination immunomodulatory therapy with systemic corticosteroids and tocilizumab (TCZ) for aged patients with COVID19 associated cytokine release syndrome remains unclear.

Our results show that lung zones with abnormalities can occur juxtaposed to normal lung. Irregular pleural and small subpleural consolidations appear ubiquitously distributed throughout both lungs and occur early in the disease process. Wide B-lines are a predominant feature in COVID-19 infection. B-lines are found in a variety of patterns with number and width correlated to disease severity.

Studies conducted over the past few weeks have found that the antibody titre levels in the blood plasma of infected patients decrease over time, as is common for acute viral infections. Fully documented reinfection cases from Hong Kong, India, Belgium and USA, as well as credible to anecdotal evidence of second-time cases from other countries, bring into sharp focus the question of what profile the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. Here we use mathematical modeling to answer this question, constructing a novel delay differential equation model which is tailored to accommodate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) where a recovered case becomes completely susceptible after a given time interval following infection and (b) where a first-time recovered case becomes susceptible to a lower virulence infection after a given time interval following recovery, and becomes permanently immunized by a second infection. We find possible solutions exhibiting large number of waves of disease in the first situation and two to three waves in the second situation. Interestingly however, these multiple wave solutions are manifest only for some intermediate values of the reproduction number R, which is governed by public health intervention measures. For sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the short-lived immunity. Our results cast insight into the potential spreading dynamics of the disease and might also be useful for analysing the spread after a vaccine is invented, and mass vaccination programs initiated.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B Shayak","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Mohit Manoj Sharma","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachel Stewart","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Adam Treacy","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Robert Jarman","author_inst":"Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Paramjeet Deol","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster University Hospital Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jose Manuel Caro","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Cristina de la Calle","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Mercedes Catalan","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Rocio Garcia Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Martinez-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Julia Origuen","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Mar Ripoll","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Rafael San Juan","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Hernando Trujillo","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Angel Sevillano","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Borja de Miguel","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Fernando Aguilar","author_inst":"University Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Carlos Gomez","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Jose Tiago Silva","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Daniel Garcia-Ruiz de Morales","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Miguel Saro-Buendia","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Angel Marrero-Sanchez","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Chiara-Graciani","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Hector Bueno","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Estela Paz-Artal","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Carlos Lumbreras","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Jose Luis Pablos","author_inst":"Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Jose Maria Aguado","author_inst":"University Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.28.20201475","rel_title":"Large scale sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from one region allows detailed epidemiology and enables local outbreak management","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.28.20201475","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3,200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organisations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1,565 positive samples (172 per 100,000 population) from 1,376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6% of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. 1,035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically-distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of ~2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a sublineage associated with 6 care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients indicating infection control measures were effective; found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility. The large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples has provided valuable additional data for public health epidemiology in the Norfolk region, and will continue to help identify and untangle hidden transmission chains as the pandemic evolves.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew J Page","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Alison E Mather","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Thanh Le Viet","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Emma J Meader","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nabil-Fareed J Alikhan","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Gemma L Kay","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Leonardo de Oliveira Martins","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Alp Aydin","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"David J Baker","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Alexander J.

The magnitude of the disparity is unclear, however, because race\/ethnicity information is often missing in surveillance data. In this study, we quantified the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and case fatality rates in an urban county by racial\/ethnic group using combined race\/ethnicity imputation and quantitative bias-adjustment for misclassification. After bias-adjustment, the magnitude of the absolute racial\/ethnic disparity, measured as the difference in infection rates between classified Black and Hispanic persons compared to classified White persons, increased 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold respectively. These results highlight that complete case analyses may underestimate absolute disparities in infection rates. Collecting race\/ethnicity information at time of testing is optimal.

Further, AI models demonstrate identify the importance of improved medical practice which evolved over the six months in treating COVID-19 virus during the pandemic, and that age is absolutely now the key factor, with much lower importance of other variables that were important to mortality near the beginning of the pandemic.

We find that demographic\/socioeconomic variables can explain the disparity in home dwell time in response to the stay-at-home order, which potentially leads to disparate exposures to the risk from the COVID-19. The results further suggest that socially disadvantaged groups are less likely to follow the order to stay at home, pointing out the extensive gaps in the effectiveness of social distancing measures exist between socially disadvantaged groups and others. Our study reveals that the long-standing inequity issue in the U.S. stands in the way of the effective implementation of social distancing measures.

Traditional radiography and CT remain the main methods of the initial examination of the chest organs. Now, most of the diagnostics has been focused on PCR, chest X-Ray\/CT manifestations of COVID-19. However, there are problems with CT due to infection control issues, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in LMIC (Low Middle Income Countries). Passive microwave radiometry (MWR) is a cheap, non-radioactive and portable technology. It has already been used for diagnostics of cancer, and other diseases. We have tested if MWR could be used for early diagnostics of pulmonary COVID-19 complications. This was a randomized controlled trial (195 subjects) to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostics using MWR in patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 while they are in hospitals of Kyrgyzstan, and healthy individuals. We have measured skin (IR) and internal (MWR) temperature by recording passive electromagnetic radiation through the chest wall in the projection of the lungs at 30 symmetrical points on both sides. Pneumonia and lung damage were diagnosed by X-RAY\/CT scan and doctor final diagnosis (pn+\/pn-). COVID-19 was determined by PCR test (covid+\/covid-). The best results were obtained between pn-\/covid- and pn+\/covid+ groups with sensitivity 92% and specificity 75%.

Methods--Two investigators independently extracted data on trial design and outcomes. Medication side effects and adverse reactions were also assessed. The primary outcome was COVID-19 hospitalization or death. When unavailable, new COVID-19 infection was used. We calculated random effects meta-analysis according to the method of DerSimonian and Laird. Heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated by calculation of Cochran Q and I2 parameters. An Egger funnel plot was drawn to investigate publication bias. We also calculated the fixed effects meta-analysis summary of the five studies.

There is an urgent need for accurate prediction of the risk of severe COVID-19 for use in workplaces and healthcare settings, and for individual risk management. Methods: Clinical risk factors and a panel of 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from published data. We used logistic regression to develop a model for severe COVID-19 in 1,582 UK Biobank participants aged 50 years and over who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus: 1,018 with severe disease and 564 without severe disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A model incorporating the SNP score and clinical risk factors (AUC=0.786) had 111% better discrimination of disease severity than a model with just age and gender (AUC=0.635). The effects of age and gender are attenuated by the other risk factors, suggesting that it is those risk factors -- not age and gender -- that confer risk of severe disease. In the whole UK Biobank, most are at low or only slightly elevated risk, but one-third are at two-fold or more increased risk. Conclusions: We have developed a model that enables accurate prediction of severe COVID-19. Continuing to rely on age and gender alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will unnecessarily classify healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately quantify the increased risk for younger people with comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gillian S Dite","author_inst":"Genetic Technologies Ltd."},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Murphy","author_inst":"Genetic Technologies Ltd."},{"author_name":"Richard Allman","author_inst":"Genetic Technologies Ltd."},{"author_name":"Harvey Risch","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Karaibragimov","author_inst":"International Medical University (IMU), Kyrgyzstan"},{"author_name":"Meder Seitov","author_inst":"International Medical University (IMU), Kyrgyzstan"},{"author_name":"Sergey Vesnin","author_inst":"Medical Microwave Radiometry, UK"},{"author_name":"Turat Kasymbekov","author_inst":"Komfort Medic, Kyrgyzstan"},{"author_name":"Chingis Mustafin","author_inst":"Comfort Medic, Kyrgyzstan"},{"author_name":"Igor Goryanin","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Lindsay J Collin","author_inst":"Huntsman Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Ana P Tedim","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Kolyva","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachael Stanley","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Diaz","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Will Potter","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Claire Stuart","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lizzie Meadows","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bell","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Ana Victoria Gutierrez","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Thomson","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Evelien M Adriaenssens","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Tracey Swingler","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Rachel AJ Gilroy","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Luke Griffith","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj K Sethi","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rose K Davidson","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Robert A Kingsley","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Luke Bedford","author_inst":"Ipswich Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lindsay J Coupland","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ian G Charles","author_inst":"Quadrum Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Ngozi Elumogo","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Wain","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Reenesh Prakash","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark A Webber","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"SJ Louise Smith","author_inst":"Norfolk County Council"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Samir Dervisevic","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Justin O'Grady","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"- The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20204297","rel_title":"Dry loop mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical specimens","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20204297","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a major disease burden on many countries around the world. The spread of COVID-19 is anticipated to have a major impact on developing countries including African nations. To establish a point-of-care test for COVID-19, we developed a dry loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. We carried out reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP using the Loopamp SARS-CoV-2 Detection kit (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). The entire mixture except for the primers is dried and immobilized inside the tube lid. To determine the specificity of the kit, 22 viral genomes associated with respiratory infections, including the SARS coronavirus, were tested. No LAMP product was detected in reactions performed with RNA from these pathogens. The sensitivity of this assay, determined by either a real-time turbidity assay or colorimetric change of the reaction mixture, as evaluated by the naked eye or under illumination with ultraviolet light, was 10 copies\/reaction. After the initial validation analysis, we analyzed 24 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients suspected to have COVID-19. Nineteen (79.2%) of the 24 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, as determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Using the Loopamp SARS-CoV-2 Detection kit, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 15 (62.5%) of the 24 samples. Thus, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Loopamp 2019-CoV-2 detection reagent kit were 94.0%, 96.0%, 95.9%, and 94.1%, respectively. The dry LAMP method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was fast and easy to use, solves the cold chain problem, and therefore represents a promising tool for diagnosis of COVID-19 in developing countries.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuki Higashimoto","author_inst":"Faculty of Medical Technology, Fujita Health University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Masaru Ihira","author_inst":"Faculty of Clinical Engineering, Fujita Health University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Kawamura","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Fujita Health University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masato Inaba","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Fujita Health University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kazuya Shirato","author_inst":"Department of Virology III, National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tadaki Suzuki","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hideki Hasegawa","author_inst":"Influenza Virus Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tsutomu Kageyama","author_inst":"Influenza Virus Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yohei Doi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Fujita Health University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tadayoshi Hata","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Fujita Health University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tetsushi Yoshikawa","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Fujita Health University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana P Tedim","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Kolyva","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachael Stanley","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Diaz","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Will Potter","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Claire Stuart","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lizzie Meadows","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bell","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Ana Victoria Gutierrez","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Thomson","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Evelien M Adriaenssens","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Tracey Swingler","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Rachel AJ Gilroy","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Luke Griffith","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj K Sethi","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rose K Davidson","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Robert A Kingsley","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Luke Bedford","author_inst":"Ipswich Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lindsay J Coupland","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ian G Charles","author_inst":"Quadrum Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Ngozi Elumogo","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Wain","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Reenesh Prakash","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark A Webber","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"SJ Louise Smith","author_inst":"Norfolk County Council"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Samir Dervisevic","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Justin O'Grady","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"- The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20204131","rel_title":"Ultra-rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in public workspace environments","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20204131","rel_abs":"Managing the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 requires new capabilities in testing, including the possibility of identifying, in minutes, infected individuals as they enter spaces where they must congregate in a functioning society, including workspaces, schools, points of entry, and commercial business establishments.

This allows tests specifically useful for this pandemic to trade-off unneeded sensitivity for necessary speed, simplicity, and frugality. In some studies, it was shown that viral load that creates forward-infection risk may exceed 105 virions per milliliter, easily within the sensitivity of an RNA amplification architecture, but unattainable by antibody-based architectures that simply target viral antigens.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the antibiotic azithromycin (AZ) are still being used by thousands and numerous hospitals to treat COVID-19. In a related context, immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade (ICB) with antibodies such as anti-PD-1 has revolutionised cancer therapy. Given that cancer patients on ICB continue to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, an understanding of the effects of HCQ and AZ on the elimination of tumors by anti-PD-1 ICB is urgently needed. In this study, we report that HCQ alone, or in combination with AZ, at doses used to treat COVID-19 patients, reverses the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 in controlling B16 melanoma tumor growth in mice. No deleterious effect was seen on untreated tumors, or in using AZ alone in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, HCQ and HCQ\/AZ inhibited PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, while specifically targeting the anti-PD-1 induced increase in progenitor CD8+CD44+PD-1+TCF1+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TILs) and the generation of CD8+CD44+PD-1+ effectors. Surprisingly, it also blocked the appearance of a subset of terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs. No effect was seen on the presence of CD4+ T-cells, FoxP3+ Tregs, thymic subsets, B-cells, antibody production, myeloid cells, or the vasculature of mice. Lastly, we identified TCF-1 expression in peripheral CD8+ T-cells from cancer or non-cancer human patients infected with SARs CoV2 as a marker for the effects of COVID-19 and HCQ on the immune system. This study indicates for the first time that HCQ and HCQ\/AZ negatively impact the ability of anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade to promote tumor rejection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janna Kreuger","author_inst":"Research Center Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Francois Santinon","author_inst":"Research Center Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Kazanova","author_inst":"Research Center Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Mark Issa","author_inst":"Research Center Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Bruno Larrivee","author_inst":"Research Center Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Catalin Milhalcioiu","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Christopher E.

We aimed to provide global, regional, and national estimates of target population sizes for COVID-19 vaccination to inform country-specific immunization strategies on a global scale. Methods Based on a previous study of international allocation for pandemic COVID-19 vaccines, we classified the entire world population into eleven priority groups. Information on priority groups was derived from a multi-pronged search of official websites, media sources and academic journal articles. The sizes of different priority groups were projected for 194 countries globally. Results Overall, the size of COVID-19 vaccine recipient population varied markedly by goals of the vaccination program and geography. The general population aged <60 years without any underlying condition accounts for the majority of the total population (5.2 billion people, 68%), followed by 2.3 billion individuals at risk of severe disease, and 46.9 million essential workers which are critical to maintaining a functional society. Differences in the demographic structure, presence of underlying conditions, and number of essential workers led to highly variable estimates of target populations both at the WHO region and country level. In particular, Europe has the highest share of essential workers (6.8%) and the highest share of individuals with underlying conditions (37.8%), two priority categories to maintain societal functions and reduce severe burden. In contrast, Africa has the highest share of healthy adults, school-age individuals, and infants (77.6%), which are the key groups to target to reduce community transmission. Interpretation The sizeable distribution of target groups on a country and regional bases underlines the importance of equitable and efficient vaccine prioritization and allocation globally. The direct and indirect benefits of COVID-19 vaccination should be balanced by considering local differences in demography and health.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qianhui Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaige Dong","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xufang Bai","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"C&eacutecile Viboud","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA; Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ana P Tedim","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Kolyva","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachael Stanley","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Diaz","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Will Potter","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Claire Stuart","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lizzie Meadows","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bell","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Ana Victoria Gutierrez","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Thomson","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Evelien M Adriaenssens","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Tracey Swingler","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Rachel AJ Gilroy","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Luke Griffith","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj K Sethi","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rose K Davidson","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Robert A Kingsley","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Luke Bedford","author_inst":"Ipswich Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lindsay J Coupland","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ian G Charles","author_inst":"Quadrum Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Ngozi Elumogo","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Wain","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Reenesh Prakash","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark A Webber","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"SJ Louise Smith","author_inst":"Norfolk County Council"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Samir Dervisevic","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Justin O'Grady","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"- The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20202416","rel_title":"Virus evolution affected early COVID-19 spread","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20202416","rel_abs":"As the SARS-Cov-2 virus spreads around the world afflicting millions of people, it has undergone divergent genetic mutations. Although most of these mutations are expected to be inconsequential, some mutations in the spike protein structure have been hypothesized to affect the critical stage at which the virus invades human cells, which could affect transmission probability and disease expression. If true, then we expect an increased growth rate of reported COVID-19 cases in regions dominated by viruses with these altered proteins. We modeled early global infection dynamics based on clade assignment along with other demographic and meteorological factors previously found to be important. Clade, but not variant D614G which has been associated with increased viral load, enhanced our ability to describe early COVID-19 growth dynamics. Including clade identity in models significantly improved predictions over earlier work based only on weather and demographic variables. In particular, higher proportions of clade 19A and 19B were negatively correlated with COVID-19 growth rate, whereas higher proportions of 20A and 20C were positively correlated with growth rate. A strong interaction between the prevalence of clade 20C and relative humidity suggests that the impact of clade identity might be more important when coupled with certain weather conditions. In particular, 20C an 20A generate the highest growth rates when coupled with low humidity. Projections based on data through April 2020 suggest that, without intervention, COVID-19 has the potential to grow more quickly in regions dominated by the 20A and 20C clades, including most of South and North America.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Derek Corcoran","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Mark C Urban","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Jill Wegrzyn","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Cory Merow","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xufang Bai","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"C&eacutecile Viboud","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA; Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ana P Tedim","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Kolyva","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachael Stanley","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Diaz","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Will Potter","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Claire Stuart","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lizzie Meadows","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bell","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Ana Victoria Gutierrez","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Thomson","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Evelien M Adriaenssens","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Tracey Swingler","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Rachel AJ Gilroy","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Luke Griffith","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj K Sethi","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rose K Davidson","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Robert A Kingsley","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Luke Bedford","author_inst":"Ipswich Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lindsay J Coupland","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ian G Charles","author_inst":"Quadrum Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Ngozi Elumogo","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Wain","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Reenesh Prakash","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark A Webber","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"SJ Louise Smith","author_inst":"Norfolk County Council"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Samir Dervisevic","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Justin O'Grady","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"- The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.30.20204644","rel_title":"Estimation of novel coronavirus (covid-19) reproduction number and case fatality rate: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.30.20204644","rel_abs":"Understanding the transmission dynamics and the severity of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) informs public health interventions, surveillance, and planning. Two important parameters, the basic reproduction number (R0) and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19, help in this understanding process. The objective of this study was to estimate the R0 and CFR of COVID-19 and assess whether the parameters vary in different regions of the world. We carried out a systematic review to retrieve the published estimates of the R0 and the CFR in articles from international databases between 1st January and 31st August 2020. Random-effect models and Forest plots were implemented to evaluate the mean effect size of the R0 and the CFR. Furthermore, the R0 and CFR of the studies were quantified based on geographic location, the tests\/thousand population, and the median population age of the countries where studies were conducted. The I2 statistic and the Cochran's Q test were applied to assess statistical heterogeneity among the selected studies. Forty-five studies involving R0 and thirty-four studies involving CFR were included. The pooled estimation of the R0 was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98), and that of the CFR was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13). The CFR in different regions of the world varied significantly, from 2.51 (2.12, 2.95) in Asia to 7.11 (6.38, 7.91) in Africa. We observed higher mean CFR values for the countries with lower tests (3.15 vs. 2.16) and greater median population age (3.13 vs. 2.27). However, the R0 did not vary significantly in different regions of the world. An R0 of 2.69 and CFR of 2.67 indicate the severity of the COVID-19. Although R0 and CFR may vary over time, space, and demographics, we recommend considering these figures in control and prevention measures.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tanvir Ahammed","author_inst":"Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Aniqua Anjum","author_inst":"Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Meshbahur Rahman","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka-1230, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Najmul Haider","author_inst":"Royal Veterinary College"},{"author_name":"Richard Kock","author_inst":"Royal Veterinary College"},{"author_name":"Md.

Accordingly, the global economy as well is facing the worst economic catastrophe since the 1930s Great Depression. The case in Egypt is similar to the rest of the world. Despite being threatened by GDP decline and income losses; the Egyptian government has reacted early to restrain the pandemic outbreak. By mid-March, many measures had been undertaken to contain the spread of the virus. More than three months after imposing them, Egypt began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Predictions of the potential spread of Covid-19 based on time series Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and econometric Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) forecasting models are utilized in this paper for designing and\/or evaluating countermeasures. The aim of this study is threefold, first using the most recent available data to find the best prediction models for daily cases and death in Egypt and forecast them up to 7 November 2020. Second, to analyze the effect of mobility on the incidence of the pandemic using Google Community Mobility Reports (GCMR) to evaluate the results of easing lockdown restrictions. Finally, providing some recommendations that may help lessen the spread of the virus and eradicate new deaths as possible. The results revealed that mobility of population is affecting the incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly over the period of the study. Additionally, the total number of infections on November 7 2020 is expected to reach 102,352 cases, while the total death toll is predicted to be 5,938 according to the most accurate methods of forecasting. Accordingly, in order to sustain the predicted flat pandemic curve, many restrictions must be continued and emergency mechanisms need to be considered. For instance, adhering to the precautions of social distancing advised by the health minister and the declared hygiene rules to ensure that infection is prevented or transmitted is necessary. Besides, being prepared with re-imposing lockdown strategies and health system support are essential among others. It should also be noted that this expected pattern can shift, yet that depends on people's actions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shereen Nosier","author_inst":"Bibliotheca Alexandrina"},{"author_name":"Reham Salah Beram","author_inst":"Bibliotheca Alexandrina"},{"author_name":"Alexandra A Antonnikova","author_inst":"Institute for Problems of Chemical and Energetic Technologies"},{"author_name":"Najmul Haider","author_inst":"Royal Veterinary College"},{"author_name":"Richard Kock","author_inst":"Royal Veterinary College"},{"author_name":"Md.

Additionally, we show that the increase in frequency of a potentially more transmissible viral variant (614G) over time can potentially be explained by regional mobility differences and multiple introductions of 614G, but not the other variant (614D) into the state. At an individual level, we see evidence of higher viral loads in patients infected with the 614G variant. However, using clinical records data, we do not find any evidence that the 614G variant impacts clinical severity or patient outcomes.

In this study, we intend to summarise so far available pieces of evidence documenting SARS-CoV-2 mediated spinal demyelination in terms of clinical, laboratory parameters and imaging characteristics. Methodology- This review was carried out based on the existing PRISMA (Preferred Report for Systemic Review and Meta-analyses) consensus statement. Data was collected from four databases: Pubmed\/Medline, NIH Litcovid, Embase and Cochrane library and Preprint servers up till 10th September, 2020. Search strategy comprised of a range of keywords from relevant medical subject headings which includes \"SARS-COV-2\", \"COVID-19\", \"demyelination\" etc. Results- A total of 21 cases were included from 21 case reports after screening from various databases and preprint servers. Biochemical analysis reveals that the majority of cases showed elevated CSF protein as well as lymphocytic pleocytosis. Interestingly, a majority of cases were found to be associated with long extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), and remaining cases were found to be associated with isolated patchy involvement or isolated short segment involvement or combined LETM and patchy involvement. Few cases were also found with significant co-involvement of the brain and spine based on the imaging data. Conclusion- It can be interpreted that SARS-CoV-2 may play a potential role in spinal demyelinating disorders in both para-infectious and post-infectious forms.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ritwick Mondal","author_inst":"Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education Research, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Shramana Deb","author_inst":"S.N.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to indirectly impact the transmission dynamics and prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Studies have already documented reductions in sexual activity (\"sexual distancing\") and interruptions in HIV\/STI services, but it is unknown what combined impact these two forces will have on longer-term HIV\/STI epidemic trajectories. METHODS. We adapted a network-based model of co-circulating HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia for a population of men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Atlanta area. Model scenarios varied the timing, overlap, and relative extent of COVID-related sexual distancing in casual and one-time partnership networks and service interruption within four service categories (HIV screening, HIV PrEP, HIV ART, and STI treatment). RESULTS. A 50% relative decrease in sexual partnerships and interruption of all clinical services, both lasting 18 months, would generally offset each other for HIV (total 5-year population impact for Atlanta MSM: -227 cases), but have net protective effect for STIs (-23,800 cases). Greater relative reductions and longer durations of service interruption would increase HIV and STI incidence, while greater relative reductions and longer durations of sexual distancing would decrease incidence of both. If distancing lasted only 3 months but service interruption lasted 18 months, the total 5-year population impact would be an additional 890 HIV cases and 57,500 STI cases. CONCLUSIONS. The counterbalancing impact of sexual distancing and clinical service interruption depends on the infection and the extent and durability of these COVID-related changes. If sexual behavior rebounds while service interruption persists, we project an excess of hundreds of HIV cases and thousands of STI cases just among Atlanta MSM over the next 5 years. Immediate action to limit the impact of service interruptions is needed to address the indirect effects of the global COVID pandemic on the HIV\/STI epidemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel M Jenness","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Adrien Le Guillou","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Christina Chandra","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Laura M Mann","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Travis Sanchez","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Westreich","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Julia L Marcus","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Erica Ryke","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Hong Xie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amin Addetia","author_inst":"University of  Washington"},{"author_name":"Victoria M Rachleff","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Nicole Lieberman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Meei-Li Huang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Romesh Gautom","author_inst":"Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Geoff Melly","author_inst":"Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Brian Hiatt","author_inst":"Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Philip Dykema","author_inst":"Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D.

There is no specific drug or vaccine that can cure the infection or protect people from the infection of coronavirus. It is therefore prudent to use the existing resources and control strategies in an optimal way to contain the virus spread and provide the best possible treatments to the infected individuals. Use of the repurposing drugs along with the non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies may be the right way for fighting against the ongoing pandemic. It is the objective of this work to demonstrate through mathematical modelling and analysis how and to what extent such control strategies can improve the overall Covid-19 epidemic burden. The criteria for disease elimination & persistence were established through the basic reproduction number. A case study with the Indian Covid-19 epidemic data is presented to visualize and illustrate the effects of lockdown, maintaining personal hygiene & safe distancing, and repurposing drugs. It is shown that India can significantly improve the overall Covid-19 epidemic burden through the combined use of NPIs and repurposing drugs though containment of spreading is difficult without serious community participation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chittaranjan Mondal","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Debadatta Adak","author_inst":"Maharaja Bir Bikram University, Agartal, Tripura"},{"author_name":"Abhijit Majumder","author_inst":"Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Nandadulal Bairagi","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Travis Sanchez","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Westreich","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Julia L Marcus","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Erica Ryke","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Hong Xie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amin Addetia","author_inst":"University of  Washington"},{"author_name":"Victoria M Rachleff","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Nicole Lieberman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Meei-Li Huang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Romesh Gautom","author_inst":"Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Geoff Melly","author_inst":"Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Brian Hiatt","author_inst":"Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Philip Dykema","author_inst":"Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D.

CRISPR-based diagnostics that utilize RNA and DNA-targeting enzymes can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable and accurate. Here we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a-based mobile phone assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA extracts. The assay achieved ~100 copies\/L sensitivity in under 30 minutes and accurately detected a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 minutes. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity, and we directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. Combined with mobile phone-based quantification, this assay can provide rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening to aid in the control of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Parinaz Fozouni","author_inst":"UCSF\/Gladstone Institutes"},{"author_name":"Sungmin Son","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n Derby","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Gavin J Knott","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Carley N Gray","author_inst":"Gladstone Institutes"},{"author_name":"Michael V D'Ambrosio","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Chunyu Zhao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Neil A Switz","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"G.
