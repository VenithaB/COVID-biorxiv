Italy, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, the US and Japan are probably the countries with the most severe outbreaks. Collecting epidemiological data and predicting epidemic trends are important for the development and measurement of public intervention strategies. Epidemic prediction results yielded by different mathematical models are inconsistent; therefore, we sought to compare different models and their prediction results to generate objective conclusions. Methods: We used the number of cases reported from January 23 to March 20, 2020, to estimate the possible spread size and peak time of COVID-19, especially in 8 high-risk countries. The logistic growth model, basic SEIR model and adjusted SEIR model were adopted for prediction. Given that different model inputs may infer different model outputs, we implemented three model predictions with three scenarios of epidemic development. Results: When comparing all 8 countries short-term prediction results and peak predictions, the differences among the models were relatively large. The logistic growth model estimated a smaller epidemic size than the basic SERI model did; however, once we added parameters that considered the effects of public health interventions and control measures, the adjusted SERI model results demonstrated a considerably rapid deceleration of epidemic development. Our results demonstrated that contact rate, quarantine scale, and the initial quarantine time and length are important factors in controlling epidemic size and length. Conclusions: We demonstrated a comparative assessment of the predictions of the COVID-19 outbreak in eight high-risk countries using multiple methods. By forecasting epidemic size and peak time as well as simulating the effects of public health interventions, the intent of this paper is to help clarify the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and recommend operation suggestions to slow down the epidemic. It is suggested that the quick detection of cases, sufficient implementation of quarantine and public self-protection behaviors are critical to slow down the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiang Zhou","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xudong Ma","author_inst":"National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Na Hong","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity. Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbreaks under immediate control when needed. This is as yet untested even for a combination of national interventions including case isolation, household quarantine, population-wide social distancing and closure of schools and universities. Although there are disadvantages to both types of approach, suppression has the advantage of buying time until a vaccine and\/or treatment become available and allowing NZ to learn from rapidly unfolding events in other countries. A combination of successful suppression, strong border measures, and widespread contact tracing and testing resulting in containment could allow periods when control measures can be relaxed, but only if cases are reduced to a handful.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Yingying Ma","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

We look for a link between the rate  and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. We analyze a {\\it base} set of 42 countries, which developed the epidemic at an earlier stage, an {\\it intermediate} set of 88 countries and an {\\it extended} set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently. Fitting with a linear behavior (T), we find increasing evidence in the three datasets for a decreasing growth rate as a function of T, at $99.66\\%$C.L., $99.86\\%$C.L. and $99.99995 \\%$ C.L.

The doubling time is expected to increase by $40\\%\\sim 50\\%$, going from $5^\\circ$ C to $25^\\circ$ C. In the {\\it base} set, going beyond a linear model, a peak at about $(7.7\\pm 3.6)^\\circ C$ seems to be present in the data, but such evidence disappears for the larger datasets. Moreover we have analyzed the possible existence of a bias: poor countries, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing. By excluding countries below a given GDP per capita from the dataset, we find that this affects our conclusions only slightly and only for the {\\it extended} dataset. The significance always remains high, with a $p$-value of about $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ or less. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the next cold season.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessio Notari","author_inst":"Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Yingying Ma","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus has emerged. This has suddenly turned out into global health concern. Objectives: Aim of this research is to focus on the bibliometric aspects in order to measure what is published in the first 30-days of a global epidemic outbreak Methods: We searched PubMed database in order to find all relevant studies in the first 30-days from the first publication. Results: From the initial 442 identified articles, 234 were read in-extenso. The majority of papers come from China, UK and USA. 63.7% of the papers were commentaries, editorials and reported data and only 17.5% of the sources used data directly collected on the field. Topics mainly addressed were epidemiology, preparedness and generic discussion. NNR showed a reduction for both the objectives assessed from January to February. Conclusions: Diagnosis and effective preventive and therapeutic measures were the fields in which more research is still needed. The vast majority of scientific literature in the first 30-days of an epidemic outbreak is based on reported data rather than primary data. Nevertheless, the scientific statements and public health decisions rely on these data.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"DAVIDE GORI","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Erik Boetto","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Maria Pia Fantini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Yingying Ma","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

As of March 1, 2020, 79,968 patients in China and 7169 outside of China had tested positive for COVID19 and a mortality rate of 3.6% has been observed amongst Chinese patients. Its primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel or in aerosols for upto 3 hours and is relatively more stable than the known human coronaviruses. It is stable in faeces at room temperature for at least 1-2 days and can be stable in infected patients for up to 4 days. Heat at 56 degree Celsius kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes. Thus, temperature is an important factor in survival of COVID19 virus and this article focuses on understanding the relationship between temperature and COVID19 transmission from the data available between January-March 2020.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"shrikant pawar","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Aditya Stanam","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Mamata Chaudhari","author_inst":"Western Kentucky University"},{"author_name":"Durga Rayudu","author_inst":"NTR University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Ma","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

METHODS We used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing: targeted testing of high-risk individuals (n=4,551) and a population screening (n=5,502). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 340 individuals. RESULTS On March 22 2020, 528 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the targeted testing (11.6%) and 50 in the population screening (0.9%); approximately 0.2% of the Icelandic population. Large fractions of positives had travelled outside Iceland (38.4% and 34.0%). Fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older: 2.8% vs. 12.3% for targeted testing (P=1.6e-9) and 0.0% vs. 1.0% for population screening (P=0.031). Fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males (9.5% vs. 14.6%, P=6.8e-9). SARS-CoV-2 came from eight clades, seven A clades and one B clade. The clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time. In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of clades were A2a1 and A2a2 derived from Italian and Austrian skiing areas, but in the later targeted testing went down to 30.6% and were overtaken by A1a and A2a, the most common clades in the population screening. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 has spread widely in Iceland outside of the high-risk groups. Several strains cause these infections and their relative contribution changed rapidly. Children and females are less vulnerable than adults and males. To contain the pandemic we must increase the scope of the testing.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel F Gudbjartsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Agnar Helgason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hakon Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafur T Magnusson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044628","rel_title":"First month of the epidemic caused by COVID-19 in Italy: current status and real-time outbreak development forecast","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044628","rel_abs":"Background: The first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions. Results: We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases, and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases, of patients quarantined at home (42%), hospitalized in non-intensive care (31%), recovered or discharged (13%), deceased (10%), and hospitalized in intensive care (4%). The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 115,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic not less than 2 months. Conclusions: Once month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rosario Megna","author_inst":"National Council of Research"},{"author_name":"Agnar Helgason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hakon Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafur T Magnusson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20046177","rel_title":"A data-driven tool for tracking and predicting the course of COVID-19 epidemic as it evolves","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20046177","rel_abs":"New COVID-19 epicenters have sprung up in Europe and US as the epidemic in China wanes. Many mechanistic models past predictions for China were widely off the mark (1, 2), and still vary widely for the new epicenters, due to uncertain disease characteristics. The epidemic ended in Wuhan, and later in South Korea, with less than 1% of their population infected, much less than that required to achieve herd immunity. Now as most countries pursue the goal of suppressed equilibrium, the traditional concept of herd immunity in epidemiology needs to be re-examined. Traditional model predictions of large potential impacts serve their purpose in prompting policy decisions on contact suppression and lockdown to combat the spread, and are useful for evaluating various scenarios. After imposition of these measures it is important to turn to statistical models that incorporate real-time information that reflects ongoing policy implementation and degrees of compliance to more realistically track and project the course of the epidemic. Here we apply such a tool, supported by theory and validated by past data as accurate, to US and Europe. Most countries started with a Reproduction Number of 4 and declined to around 1 at a rate highly dependent on contact-reduction measures.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Norden E Huang","author_inst":"First Institute of Oceanography"},{"author_name":"Fangli Qiao","author_inst":"First Institute of Oceanography"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Ka-Kit Tung","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044651","rel_title":"A deductive approach to modeling the spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044651","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), previously known as 2019-nCoV, is responsible for the atypical pneumonia pandemic designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We have developed an exponential regression model using the COVID-19 case data (Jan 22 - Mar 22, 2020). Our primary model uses designated Phase 1 countries, who exceed 2500 cases on Mar 22. The model is then applied to Phase 2 countries: those that escaped the initial Phase 1 global expansion of COVID-19. With the exception of stabilizing countries (South Korea, Japan, and Iran) all Phase 1 countries are growing exponentially, as per I2500(t)=120.4 x e0.238t, with a rate, r = 0.238 {+\/-} 0.068. Excluding China, the BRICS developing nations and Australia are in Phase 2. Case data from Phase 2 countries are following the model derived from Phase 1 countries. In the absence of measures employed to flatten the curve including social distancing, quarantine, and healthcare expansion, our model projects over 274,000 cases and 12,300 deaths in the US by Mar 31. India can expect 123,000 cases by April 16. By flattening the curve to the growth rate of stabilizing countries (r = 0.044 {+\/-} 0.062), the US would prevent 8,500 deaths by Mar 31, and India would prevent 5,500 deaths by April 16.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pranav Kumar Mishra","author_inst":"Kasturba Medical College, Manipal;

Methods: We conducted a literature review of studies (n=12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n=11) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. Results: The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control\/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and\/or higher doses than typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs\/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression. Conclusion: Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI\/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19. We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishna Sriram","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Paul A.

The current study describes the situation of the outbreak of this disease in India and predicts the number of cases expected to rise in India. The study also discusses the regional analysis of Indian states and presents the preparedness level of India in combating this outbreak. The study uses exploratory data analysis to report the current situation and uses time-series forecasting methods to predict the future trends. The data has been considered from the repository of John Hopkins University and covers up the time period from 30th January 2020 when the first case occurred in India till the end of 24th March 2020 when the Prime Minister of India declared a complete lockdown in the country for 21 days starting 25th March 2020. The major findings show that number of infected cases in India is rising quickly with the average infected cases per day rising from 10 to 73 from the first case to the 300th case. The current mortality rate for India stands around 1.9. Kerala and Maharashtra are the top two infected states in India with more than 100 infected cases reported in each state, respectively. A total of 25 states have reported at least one infected case, however only 8 of them have reported deaths due to COVID-19. The ARIMA model prediction shows that the infected cases in India may reach up to 700 thousands in next 30 days in worst case scenario while most optimistic scenario may restrict the numbers up to 1000-1200. Also, the average forecast by ARIMA model in next 30 days is around 7000 patients from the current numbers of 536. Based on the forecasting model by Holts linear trends, an expected 3 million people may get infected if control measures are not taken in the near future. This study will be useful for the key stakeholders like Government Officials and Medical Practitioners in assessing the trends for India and preparing a combat plan with stringent measures. Also, this study will be helpful for data scientists, statisticians, mathematicians and analytics professionals in predicting outbreak numbers with better accuracy.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajan Gupta","author_inst":"University of Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Saibal Kumar Pal","author_inst":"DRDO, India"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Ka-Kit Tung","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044644","rel_title":"Doubling time tells how effective Covid-19 prevention works","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044644","rel_abs":"Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a rapidly spreading pandemic in many countries.

Tracking the time-dependent doubling time tells how well Covid-19 prevention works, giving an index for successful fighting.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Byung Mook Weon","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Saibal Kumar Pal","author_inst":"DRDO, India"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Ka-Kit Tung","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20044578","rel_title":"Government Responses Matter: Predicting Covid-19 cases in US under an empirical Bayesian time series framework","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20044578","rel_abs":"Since the Covid-19 outbreak, researchers have been predicting how the epidemic will evolve, especially the number in each country, through using parametric extrapolations based on the history. In reality, the epidemic progressing in a particular country depends largely on its policy responses and interventions. Since the outbreaks in some countries are earlier than United States, the prediction of US cases can benefit from incorporating the similarity in their trajectories. We propose an empirical Bayesian time series framework to predict US cases using different countries as prior reference. The resultant forecast is based on observed US data and prior information from the reference country while accounting for different population sizes. When Italy is used as prior in the prediction, which the US data resemble the most, the cases in the US will exceed 300,000 by the beginning of April unless strong measures are adopted.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ziyue Liu","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Wensheng Guo","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Ka-Kit Tung","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pall Melsted","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur L Norddahl","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Jona Saemundsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Asgeir Sigurdsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Patrick Sulem","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arna B Agustsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Berglind Eiriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Run Fridriksdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Elisabet E Gardarsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudmundur Georgsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Olafia S Gretarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kjartan R Gudmundsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thora R Gunnarsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arnaldur Gylfason","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20044495","rel_title":"An alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 - escape from the NA extraction kit-shortage","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20044495","rel_abs":"Abstract The World Health Organisation has declared a pandemic caused by the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2.

Director-General declared that \"the threat of a global pandemic has become a reality\", and the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has become a global concern. Chinese efforts in curbing the virus have widely been recognized. Even the WHO has lauded the efforts of the Chinese government and advised the world to learn from China in fighting the disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, to curb the spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government has implemented unprecedented prevention interventions at the nationwide level. Currently, the outbreak in Wuhan is changing in a positive direction and has been effectively controlled. However, it is not clear what these measures were and how these measures changed to curb the outbreak of COVID-19 quickly. This study explored the characteristics and identified that China's control strategies have changed the epidemiological curve of rapidly rising new confirmed cases of COVID-19. This study also seeks to expand the experiences and lessons from this outbreak. Methods: We collected public health interventions measures from Jan 20, 2020, to 5 March 2020, and data from COVID-19 daily newly confirmed cases and daily cumulates cases to compare the control effects and changing trends. We performed a retrospective description of these intervention strategies from three stages. Besides, from the perspective of public health, the experiences and lessons exposed by this outbreak were roughly summarized. Results: These non-pharmacology interventions measures adopted by the Chinese government by the instruction and spirit of President Xi Jinping were timely and efficient. Conclusions: The present study was conducted to comprehensively analyze from a social epidemiology context. The results confirmed that these radical interventions taken by the Chinese government were effective, ambitious, and agile. However, we must be aware that the epidemic situation in Wuhan is still challenging.

Deep learning was reported to discover intricate structures from clinical images and achieve expert-level performance in medical image analysis. To develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework on chest CT images for auto-detection of NCP, particularly focusing on differentiating NCP from influenza pneumonia (IP). Methods: 35 confirmed NCP cases were consecutively enrolled as training set from 1138 suspected patients in three NCP designated hospitals together with 361 confirmed viral pneumonia patients from center one including 156 IP patients, from May, 2015 to February, 2020. The external validation set enrolled 57 NCP patients and 50 IP patients from eight centers. Results: 96.6% of NCP lesions were larger than 1 cm and 76.8% were with intensity below -500 Hu, indicating less consolidation than IP lesions which had nodules ranging 5-10 mm. The classification schemes accurately distinguished NCP and IP lesions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) above 0.93. The Trinary scheme was more device-independent and consistent with specialists than the Plain scheme, which achieved a F1 score of 0.847, higher than the Plain scheme (0.774), specialists (0.785) and residents (0.644). Conclusions: Our study potentially provides an accurate early diagnosis tool on chest CT for NCP with high transferability, and shows high efficiency in differentiating NCP and IP, helping to reduce misdiagnosis and contain the pandemic transmission.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Min Zhou","author_inst":"Ruijin hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of

One component of PPE that is in particular demand are disposable N95 face masks. To alleviate this, many methods of N95 mask sterilization have been studied and proposed with the hope of being able to safely reuse masks. Two major considerations must be made when re-sterilizing masks: (1) the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens, penetrating into the fibers of the mask, and (2) the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters. We studied Cobalt-60 gamma irradiation as a method of effective sterilization without inducing mask degradation. Significant literature exists supporting the use of gamma radiation as a sterilization method, with viral inactivation of SARS-CoV reported at doses of at most 10 kGy, with other studies supporting 5 kGy for many types of viruses. However, concerns have been raised about the radiation damaging the fiber material within the mask, specifically by causing cross-linking of polymers, leading to cracking and degradation during fitting and\/or deployment. A set of 3M 8210 and 9105 masks were irradiated using MIT's Co-60 irradiator. Three masks of each type received 0 kiloGray (kGy), 10 kGy and 50 kGy of approximately 1.3 MeV gamma radiation from the circular cobalt sources, at a dose rate of 2.2 kGy per hour. Following this sterilization procedure, the irradiated masks passed a OSHA Gerson Qualitative Fit Test QLFT 50 (saccharin apparatus) when donned correctly, performed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, in a blinded study repeated in triplicate. However, the masks' filtration of 0.3 um particles was significantly degraded, even at 10 kGy. These results suggest against gamma, and possibly all ionizing radiation, as a method of disposable N95 sterilization. Even more importantly, they argue against using the qualitative fit test alone to assess mask integrity.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avilash Cramer","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Enze Tian","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sherryl H Yu","author_inst":"Harvard Combined Dermatology Residency Training Program"},{"author_name":"Mitchell Galanek","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Edward Lamere","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ju Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Gupta","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael P Short","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"jinqi tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"hao chu","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"haijia xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"yong zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xin Xu","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jingqi Wei","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mingxin Guan","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianxing Feng","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jieming Qu","author_inst":"Ruijin hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044214","rel_title":"Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044214","rel_abs":"We model the evolution of the number of individuals that are reported to be sick with COVID-19 in Germany. Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic. We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by individuals and the public therefore only influence the dynamics of spread of CoV-2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the officially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore offer robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries. Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we find that the long-run number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to be an absurdly large range for a precise projection, this reflects the uncertainty about the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will end up at 5 million cases. Defining the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals per day, we find a large variation depending on the effectiveness of governmental pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not influenced by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million. When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals will be around 200 thousand only. Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of August. We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection.

In the absence of effective vaccine or biomedical treatment, the basic rules of public health measures have not changed, namely public distancing. Methods: We analyzed epidemiological investigation reports during the first month of the outbreak in Israel. In addition, we present a deterministic compartment model and simulations of several scenarios emphasizing quarantine and isolation policies given their efficiency. Results: We identify an abrupt change from controlled epidemic regime to an exponential growth (R_0= 2.19) in light of the actual policy-makers decisions and public behavior in Israel. Our analysis show that before the abrupt change, the new cases trend was due to returning citizens infected abroad. The abrupt change followed a holiday in which social distancing was clearly inefficient and many public gatherings were held. We further discuss three different modeled scenarios of quarantine efficiency: high-, medium-, and low-efficiency. Conclusions: Israel early lessons show that there is no allowance to compromise with the directive of social distancing. Even before the onset of the pandemic in Israel, fine-tuned but determined early decisions were taken by policy makers to monitor flight arrivals from Covid-19 affected regions and to limit public gatherings. Our analysis show that one particular holiday has shifted the occurrence curve from controlled regime to exponential growth. Therefore, even a short lapse in public responsiveness can have a dramatic effect.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ziv Klausner","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eyal Fattal","author_inst":"Israeli Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Eitan Hirsch","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C Shapira","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Edward Lamere","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ju Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Gupta","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael P Short","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"jinqi tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"hao chu","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"haijia xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"yong zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of Wuhan University Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xin Xu","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jingqi Wei","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mingxin Guan","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianxing Feng","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jieming Qu","author_inst":"Ruijin hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20044099","rel_title":"COVID-19 transmission in Mainland China is associated with temperature and humidity: a time-series analysis","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20044099","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has become a pandemic.

A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004-0.07) in Hubei. Every 1{degrees}C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04{degrees}C to 8.2{degrees}C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongchao Qi","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Fudan University, China.

The research community is interested to know what are the hotspots in coronavirus (CoV) research and how much is known about COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis. Methods: We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eight-topic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission at present. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only accounted for less than 10% or even 4% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections. Conclusions: These results identified knowledge gaps in the area of COVID-19 and offered directions for future research.

According to the high prevalence of new coronavirus, further investigation on the clinical and paraclinical features of this disease seems essential. Hence, we carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to figure out the unknown features. Methods: This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers which reported clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19. We used STATA v.11 and random effect model for data analysis. Results: In the present meta-analysis, 32 papers including 49504 COVID-19 patients were studied. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (84%), cough (65%) and fatigue (42%), respectively. The most common radiological and paraclinical features were bilateral pneumonia (61%), ground-glass opacity (50%), thrombocytopenia (36%) and lymphocytopenia (34%). The study also showed that the frequency of comorbidities and early symptoms was higher in critically severe patients. Moreover, we found the overall mortality rate of three percent. Conclusion: According to that there are many cases without Computed Tomography Scan findings or clear clinical symptoms, it is recommended to use other confirming methods such RNA sequencing in order to identification of suspicious undiagnosed patients. Moreover, while there is no access to clinical and paraclinical facilities in in public places such as airports and border crossings, it is recommended to consider factors such as fever, cough, sputum and fatigue.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Keyvan Heydari","author_inst":"Student Research Committee, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.

Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosites exhibited glycoform heterogeneity as expected for a human cell-expressed protein subunits. We identified masses that correspond to 157 N-glycans, primarily of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, primarily of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsACE2angiotensin-converting enzyme IICryo-EMcryoelectron microscopyEenvelope proteinHCoV-NL63human coronavirus NL63Mmembrane proteinMSmass spectrometryMERS-CoVMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirusNnucleocapsid proteinRBDreceptor-binding domainSspike proteinSARS-CoV-2severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusSCEstepped collision energyZic-HILICzwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographyView Full Text","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanjun Zhao","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Mao","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yaohui Chen","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Shisheng Wang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhong","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Tao Su","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Meng Gong","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Du","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Lu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jingqiu Cheng","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hao Yang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xin Xu","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jingqi Wei","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mingxin Guan","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianxing Feng","author_inst":"Haohua Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jieming Qu","author_inst":"Ruijin hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hilma Holm","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Brynjar O Jensson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Aslaug Jonasdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Frosti Jonsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kamilla S Josefsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thordur Kristjansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Droplaug N Magnusdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Louise le Roux","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gudrun Sigmundsdottir","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gardar Sveinbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kristin E Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Maney Sveinsdottir","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Emil A Thorarensen","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Bjarni Thorbjornsson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Arthur Love","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Gisli Masson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Ingileif Jonsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Alma Moller","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Thorolfur Gudnason","author_inst":"Directorate of health, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Karl G Kristinsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."},{"author_name":"Kari Stefansson","author_inst":"deCODE genetics\/Amgen Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"}]}
