We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID-19. Methods Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness. Results Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23. Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24). Conclusions The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious, indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhaowei Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jijia Hu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zongwei Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shan Jiang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Tao Wang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhengli Shi","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhan Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.20031112","rel_title":"Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the post-pandemic period","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.04.20031112","rel_abs":"There is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 will unfold in coming years.

As of 16 May 2020, more than 4.5 million cases and more than 300,000 deaths from disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported. Reliable estimates of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential to understand clinical prognosis, plan health care capacity and for epidemic forecasting. The case fatality ratio (CFR), calculated from total numbers of reported cases and reported deaths, is the most commonly reported metric, but can be a misleading measure of overall mortality. The objectives of this study were to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) infer estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for biases and examine the CFR, the symptomatic case fatality ratio (sCFR) and the infection fatality ratio (IFR) in different geographic locations. Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed- infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases: preferential ascertainment of severe cases and right-censoring of mortality. We fitted the transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province, China and applied the same model to six regions in Europe: Austria, Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Wuerttemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain and Switzerland. In Hubei, the baseline estimates were: CFR 2.4% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 2.1-2.8%), sCFR 3.7% (3.2-4.2%) and IFR 2.9% (2.4-3.5%). Estimated measures of mortality changed over time. Across the six locations in Europe estimates of CFR varied widely. Estimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for bias, were more similar to each other but still showed some degree of heterogeneity. Estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95% CrI 0.4-0.6%) in Switzerland to 1.4% (1.1-1.6%) in Lombardy, Italy. In all locations, mortality increased with age. Among 80+ year olds, estimates of the IFR suggest that the proportion of all those infected with SARS-CoV-2 who will die ranges from 20% (95% CrI: 16-26%) in Switzerland to 34% (95% CrI: 28-40%) in Spain. A limitation of the model is that count data by date of onset are required and these are not available in all countries. Conclusions. We propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of SARS-Cov-2 mortality from surveillance data during outbreaks. The CFR is not a good predictor of overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 and should not be used for evaluation of policy or comparison across settings. Geographic differences in IFR suggest that a single IFR should not be applied to all settings to estimate the total size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in different countries. The sCFR and IFR, adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, are measures that can be used to improve and monitor clinical and public health strategies to reduce the deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony Hauser","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Michel J Counotte","author_inst":"ISPM University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Charles C Margossian","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Garyfallos Konstantinoudis","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian L Althaus","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern, Federal Office of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.20030973","rel_title":"Study of the mental health status of medical personnel dealing with new coronavirus pneumonia","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.04.20030973","rel_abs":"Objective: This paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the implementation of targeted education on mental health.

Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model. Predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results. Recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS The first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in Wuhan on December 8, 2019. When Wuhan City took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; If wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on January 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on January 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. CONCLUSIONS Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role. Wearing a mask when going out and avoiding close contact with people can effectively reduce the infection rate.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhou Tang","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xianbin Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Houqiang Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"aizhen Pan","author_inst":"The First People  Hospital of Foshan"},{"author_name":"qian yu li","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical"},{"author_name":"Christian L Althaus","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern, Federal Office of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.20030916","rel_title":"Serological detection of 2019-nCoV respond to the epidemic: A useful complement to nucleic acid testing","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.04.20030916","rel_abs":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly to more than 70 countries and regions overseas and over 80000 cases have been infected, resulting in more than three thousand deaths.

Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamic characteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient. Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, clinical characteristics, symptoms and signs, treatment and clinical outcome in detail. Blood samples were collected and we determined the expression levels of immune cells (CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD16+56+ NK cells) in different time points. Nanopore Targeted Sequencing was used to determine the alterations of gut microbiota homeostasis. Results Apart from the clinical features described previously4, we found that four patients had decreased immune cells and refractory hypoxemia during the hospitalization, and the severity of hypoxemia was strongly correlated to the expression levels of immune cells. Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. Notably, all patients died. Conclusions We discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with COVID-2019. Hypoxemia severity was closely related with host immune cell levels, and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which revealing that immunodepletion with refractory hypoxemia is a potential high risk subtype of COVID-2019 and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut dysbiosis may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yongqing Tong","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Gaigai Shen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery, Ministry of Education and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Aisi Fu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery, Ministry of Education and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yanqiu Lai","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoya Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yuhong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yuchen Pan","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyao Yu","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Tiangang Liu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery  Ministry of Education and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hong Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.03.20030668","rel_title":"Clinical findings in critical ill patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Guangdong Province, China: a multi-center, retrospective, observational study","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.03.20030668","rel_abs":"Abstract Background In December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province. Methods In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. Results Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. Majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. A total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of February 28th 2020, only one patient (2.2%) had died and half of them had discharged of ICU. Conclusions Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in critical illness is characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction. Compared with critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, the mortality of critically ill patients in Guangdong Province was relatively low. These data provide some general understandings and experience for the critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Zhiheng Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Xuesong Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Lihua Cai","author_inst":"Dongguan People's Hospital, Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Haichong Zheng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Yongbo Huang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Lixin Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan First People's Hospital, Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Linxi Huang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Yun Lin","author_inst":"Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Liehua Deng","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Li","author_inst":"Zhongshan City People's Hospital, Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Sibei Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Dongdong Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Lin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Weiqun He","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.03.20030445","rel_title":"Modelling-based evaluation of the effect of quarantine control by the Chinese government in the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.03.20030445","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over China and across the world.

A retrospective modeling of the transmission dynamics would provide insights into the epidemiological characteristics of the disease and evaluation of the effectiveness of the strict measures that have been taken by central and local governments of China. Using a refined susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission model and a new strategy of model fitting, we were able to estimate model parameters in a dynamic manner. The resulting parameter estimation can well reflect the prevention policy scenarios. Our simulation results with different degrees of government control suggest that the strictly enforced quarantine and travel ban have significantly decreased the otherwise uncontrollable spread of the disease. Our results suggest similar measures should be considered by other countries that are of high risk of COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinkai Zhou","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Zhigui Wu","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Ranran Yu","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Shanni Cao","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Wen Fang","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Zhen Jiang","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Fang Yuan","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Chao Yan","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Dijun Chen","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Liehua Deng","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Li","author_inst":"Zhongshan City People's Hospital, Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Sibei Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Dongdong Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Lin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Weiqun He","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.20030452","rel_title":"Clinical features and outcomes of 221 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.20030452","rel_abs":"Rationale: In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China, now spreading across the whole country and world. More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte\/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.

Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for COVID-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: To estimate the burden of United States workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. For this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus. Results: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). Conclusions: The large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. This work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marissa G Baker","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Trevor K Peckham","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Noah S.

Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"Cancer center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."},{"author_name":"Jieying Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."},{"author_name":"Yuhui Yang","author_inst":"Cancer center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."},{"author_name":"Hong Ma","author_inst":"Cancer center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."},{"author_name":"Zhengyu Li","author_inst":"Cancer center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."},{"author_name":"Jiaoyue Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022,China."},{"author_name":"Ji Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022,China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoyun Zhang","author_inst":"Liver intensive care unint, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Zhao","author_inst":"Cancer center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."},{"author_name":"Zihan Xia","author_inst":"Cancer center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China"},{"author_name":"Liling Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."},{"author_name":"Gang Wu","author_inst":"Cancer center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China."},{"author_name":"Zhimin Lin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Weiqun He","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Department o"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.01.20029785","rel_title":"Clinical and Laboratory Profiles of 75 Hospitalized Patients with Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Hefei, China","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.01.20029785","rel_abs":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China. The number of cases has increased markedly in Anhui, but information on the clinical characteristics of patients is limited. We reported 75 patients with COVID-19 in the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory nasopharyngeal swab samples. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Of the 75 patients with COVID-19, 61 (81.33%) had a direct or indirect exposure history to Wuhan. Common symptoms at onset included fever (66 [88.0%] of 75 patients) and dry cough (62 [82.67%]). Of the patients without fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. The most prominent laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients with elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed significant decreases in the LYM%, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts. Besides, the percentage of neutrophils, CRP, LDH and Procalcitonin levels increased significantly. We concluded that COVID-19 could cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities and damage of internal organs. Hematological profiles including LYM, LDH, CRP and IL-6 could be indicators of diseases severity and evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Antiviral treatment requires a comprehensive and supportive approach. Further targeted therapy should be determined based on individual clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zonghao Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Jiajia Xie","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, "},{"author_name":"Ming Yin","author_inst":"Department of ICU, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 2"},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"Department of ICU, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 2"},{"author_name":"Hongliang He","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Tengchuan Jin","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Wenting Li","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hefei Infectious Diseases Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, 230000, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Changcheng Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Lei Li","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Yi Li","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Hylemariam Mihiretie Mengist","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Zahid","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Ziqin Yao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Chengchao Ding","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Qi","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Ma","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.03.20029843","rel_title":"Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak: an observational and modelling study","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.03.20029843","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. Results: We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, R2=0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020. Conclusion: The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shengjie Lai","author_inst":"WorldPop, School of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Nick W Ruktanonchai","author_inst":"WorldPop, School of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Liangcai Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Olivia Prosper","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"},{"author_name":"Wei Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica R Floyd","author_inst":"WorldPop, School of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Amy Wesolowski","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Santillana","author_inst":"Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chi Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiangjun Du","author_inst":"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"WorldPop, School of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Hylemariam Mihiretie Mengist","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Zahid","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Ziqin Yao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Chengchao Ding","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Qi","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Ma","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.20030007","rel_title":"The timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.20030007","rel_abs":"The apparent early success in China's large-scale intervention to control the COVID-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions. In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. We believe that is a policy question. If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Di Lauro","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Istv\u00e1n Z Kiss","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Joel Miller","author_inst":"La Trobe University"},{"author_name":"Olivia Prosper","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"},{"author_name":"Wei Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica R Floyd","author_inst":"WorldPop, School of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Amy Wesolowski","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Santillana","author_inst":"Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chi Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiangjun Du","author_inst":"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"WorldPop, School of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Hylemariam Mihiretie Mengist","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Zahid","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Ziqin Yao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Chengchao Ding","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Qi","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Ma","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.20030049","rel_title":"Estimation of COVID-19 outbreak size in Italy based on international case exportations","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.20030049","rel_abs":"Italy is currently experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19 which emerged in the Lombardy region . During the interval between February 25-29, 2020, we identified 46 cases of COVID-19 reported in 21 countries in Europe, Africa, North America, and South America which were either in individuals with recent travel from Italy, or who had presumed infection by a traveler from Italy 2. In six cases, in four of the affected countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route of introduction. We used air travel volume between Italian cities and cities in other countries as an index of connectedness, using data available from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for February 2015 (2.61 million total departing international air passengers from Italy). We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Italy necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of Italy (63%) and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3.4 days), and assumed the Italian epidemic began one month prior to February 29, 2020. We also performed sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel. When all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% CI 2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on February 29, 2020, suggesting non-identification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. In sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552 to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases). We recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in Iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. The reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from Italy, relative to Iran. In summary, we suggest that the numerous COVID-19 case exportations from Italy in recent days suggest an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in South Korea, which reports 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of February 29, 2020.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashleigh Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Victoria Ng","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Erin Rees","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Wei Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica R Floyd","author_inst":"WorldPop, School of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Amy Wesolowski","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Santillana","author_inst":"Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chi Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiangjun Du","author_inst":"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"WorldPop, School of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Hylemariam Mihiretie Mengist","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Zahid","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Ziqin Yao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Chengchao Ding","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Qi","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Ma","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.01.20029884","rel_title":"Preliminary epidemiological analysis on children and adolescents with novel coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei Province in China: an observational study utilizing crowdsourced data","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.01.20029884","rel_abs":"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to expand across the world. Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients [&le;]19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside\/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%). Conclusions: The number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand the course of this infection in children.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brandon Michael Henry","author_inst":"Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, The Heart Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Maria Helena S Oliveira","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Erin Rees","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Wei Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica R Floyd","author_inst":"WorldPop, School of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Amy Wesolowski","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Santillana","author_inst":"Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chi Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiangjun Du","author_inst":"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"WorldPop, School of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Hylemariam Mihiretie Mengist","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Zahid","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural Immunology, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230027, China"},{"author_name":"Ziqin Yao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Chengchao Ding","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Qi","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Ma","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.20029975","rel_title":"Exuberant elevation of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra during SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with disease severity and fatal outcome","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.20029975","rel_abs":"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, December 2019, and continuously poses a serious threat to public health.

In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2\/FaO2 and Murray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) calculations. Serial detection of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in 14 severe cases showed that the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with disease deterioration and fatal outcome. In conclusion, we report three cytokines that closely associated with disease severity and outcome of COVID-19.

Suboptimal T and B cell responses can delay viral clearance in MERS and SARS patients. The role of leukomonocytes in viral clearance of COVID-19 patients is not yet well defined.Methods: From January 26 to February 28, 2020, an observational study was launched at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cellsand B cells as compared to the still viral RNA positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. Conclusions: By comparison of leukomonocytes counts in COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. The restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an COVID-19 infection. We propose that restoration of leukomonocytes counts can be added to the COVID-19 diagnostic guidanceas a criterion for releasing and discharging patients.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoping Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxin Ling","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Zoonosis Science Center, University of Uppsala"},{"author_name":"Pingzheng Mo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yongxi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qunqun Jiang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Ma","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qian Cao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Hu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shi Zou","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liangjun Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lei Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology\/ Institute of Medical Virology\/ Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuha"},{"author_name":"Mingqi Luo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Tielong Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liping Deng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ke Liang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shihui Song","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Rongrong Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ruiying Zheng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Hou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology\/ Institute of Medical Virology\/ Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuha"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.01.20029645","rel_title":"How does the outbreak of 2019-nCoV spread in mainland China?

Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-location routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, 2020, whereas the self-transmission in each provincial-level administrative region (location, hereafter) was accelerating over February 4--15, 2020. From February 16, 2020, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19, 2020.

Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in locations with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiandeng Jiang","author_inst":"Southwestern University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Le Chang","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Yanlin Shi","author_inst":"Macquarie University"},{"author_name":"Yongxi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qunqun Jiang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Ma","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qian Cao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Hu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shi Zou","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liangjun Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lei Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology\/ Institute of Medical Virology\/ Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuha"},{"author_name":"Mingqi Luo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Tielong Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liping Deng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ke Liang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shihui Song","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Rongrong Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ruiying Zheng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Hou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology\/ Institute of Medical Virology\/ Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuha"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.03.20029983","rel_title":"Transmission interval estimates suggest pre-symptomatic spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.03.20029983","rel_abs":"Background: As the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading, incoming data allows us to quantify values of key variables that determine the transmission and the effort required to control the epidemic.

Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65,2.09) secondary cases per infective. Conclusions: Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring. Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lauren Tindale","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Michelle Coombe","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Jessica E Stockdale","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Emma Garlock","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Wing Yin Venus Lau","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Manu Saraswat","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Yen-Hsiang Brian Lee","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Louxin Zhang","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Dongxuan Chen","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jacco Wallinga","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Mingqi Luo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Tielong Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liping Deng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ke Liang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shihui Song","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Rongrong Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ruiying Zheng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Hou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology\/ Institute of Medical Virology\/ Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuha"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.20029868","rel_title":"Close contacts and household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in China: a content analysis based on local Heath Commissions' public disclosures.","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.20029868","rel_abs":"Question: What are the characteristics of household and social transmissions of COVID-19 areas outside of epidemic centers?

We developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuzhen Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University"},{"author_name":"Bin Jiang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University"},{"author_name":"Jiamin Yuan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University"},{"author_name":"Yanyun Tao","author_inst":"Soochow University"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Du","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Paolo Bosetti","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Cowling","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ye Wu","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Dongxuan Chen","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jacco Wallinga","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Mingqi Luo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Tielong Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liping Deng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ke Liang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shihui Song","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Rongrong Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ruiying Zheng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Hou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology\/ Institute of Medical Virology\/ Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuha"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.03.20030627","rel_title":"SOCRATES: An online tool leveraging a social contact data sharing initiative to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.03.20030627","rel_abs":"Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19.

METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age <20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till February 18. We found that at least 59% of infected cases were unascertained in Wuhan, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures have effectively controlled the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Special efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers, elderly and children. Estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chaolong Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Li Liu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xingjie Hao","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huan Guo","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qi Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiao Huang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Na He","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xihong Lin","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"An Pan","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng Wei","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tangchun Wu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tielong Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liping Deng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ke Liang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shihui Song","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Rongrong Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ruiying Zheng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Hou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology\/ Institute of Medical Virology\/ Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuha"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.03.20030353","rel_title":"Epidemiological and clinical features of 291 cases with coronavirus disease 2019 in areas adjacent to Hubei, China: a double-center observational study","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.03.20030353","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: The clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Hubei and other areas are different. We aim to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patient with COVID-19 in Hunan which is adjacent to Hubei. Methods: In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients' electronic medical records were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe\/critical group in detail. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020. Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe\/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe\/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%, p=0.007) were higher than mild group. Fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%), and fatigue (31.6%) were common symptoms especially for severe and critical patients. Typical lung imaging finding were bilateral and unilateral ground glass opacity or consolidation. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia occurred in 36.1%, 22.7% and 50.2% patients respectively. Increased fibrinogen was detected in 45 of 58 (77.6%) patients with available results. 29 of 44 (65.9%) or 22 of 40 (55.0%) patients were positive in Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody test respectively. Compared with mild or moderate group, severe\/critical group had a relative higher level of neutrophil, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, h-CRP, ESR, CK, CK-MB, LDH, D-dimer, and a lower level of lymphocyte, eosinophils, platelet, HDL and sodium (all p<0.01). Most patients received antiviral therapy and Chinese Medicine therapy. As of February 20, 2020, 159 (54.6%) patients were discharged and 2 (0.7%) patients died during hospitalization. The median length of hospital stay in discharged patients was 12 days (IQR: 10-15). Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hunan is different from patients in Wuhan. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe\/critical group and moderate group were higher than mild group. Laboratory and imaging examination can assist in the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xu Chen","author_inst":"The second Xiangya hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Fang Zheng","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Changsha City, Changsha, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Yanhua Qing","author_inst":"Loudi Central Hospital, Loudi, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Shuizi Ding","author_inst":"The second Xiangya hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Danhui Yang","author_inst":"The second Xiangya hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Lei","author_inst":"The second Xiangya hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhilan Yin","author_inst":"The second Xiangya hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xianglin Zhou","author_inst":"The second Xiangya hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Dixuan Jiang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Changsha City, Changsha, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Qi Zuo","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Changsha City, Changsha, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Jun He","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Changsha City, Changsha, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Jianlei Lv","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Changsha City, Changsha, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Ping Chen","author_inst":"The second Xiangya hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yan Chen","author_inst":"The second Xiangya hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Hong Peng","author_inst":"The second Xiangya hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Honghui Li","author_inst":"Loudi Central Hospital, Loudi, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Yuanlin Xie","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Changsha City, Changsha, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Jiyang Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Changsha City, Changsha, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Zhiguo Zhou","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Changsha City, Changsha, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Hong Luo","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Hou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology\/ Institute of Medical Virology\/ Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuha"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.20030395","rel_title":"Clinical Features of Patients Infected with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Shanghai, China","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.04.20030395","rel_abs":"Background: Since mid-December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia-like diseases caused by a novel coronavirus, now designated COVID-19 by the WHO, emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Results: Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure.
