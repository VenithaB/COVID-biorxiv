By calculating future trajectories in these countries based on the observed Chinese fatality statistics, an estimate of the total deaths and maximum daily death rates over a defined period of time is made. Our lower bound estimate for the United Kingdom based on the real data approximates the lower bound estimate of the recent modelling study of Ferguson et al. [1]. These results suggest there may be a threshold of effective public health intervention. Our method of viewing the data may be helpful in monitoring the course of the epidemic, judging the effectiveness of implementation, and monitoring the relaxation of social distancing.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William Thomas Pike","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Vikas Saini","author_inst":"Lown Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.007898","rel_title":"Computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein O-glycosylation and phosphorylation modifications and identifying potential target positions against CD209L-mannose interaction to inhibit initial binding of the virus","rel_date":"2020-03-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.007898","rel_abs":"COVID-19 outbreak is still threatening the public health. Therefore, in the middle of the pandemic, all kind of knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 may help us to find the solution. Determining the 3D structures of the proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions are of great importance in the fight against infection. Besides, post-translational modifications of the protein on 3D structure should be revealed in order to understand the protein function since these modifications are responsible for the host-pathogen interaction. Based on these, we predicted O-glycosylation and phosphorylation positions using full amino acid sequence of S1 protein. Candidate positions were further analyzed with enzyme binding activity, solvent accessibility, surface area parameters and the positions determined with high accuracy rate were used to design full 3D glycoprotein structure of the S1 protein using carbohydrate force field. In addition, the interaction between the C-type lectin CD209L and -mannose residues was examined and carbohydrate recognition positions were predicted. We suggest these positions as a potential target for the inhibition of the initial binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein to the host cell.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammet Uslupehlivan","author_inst":"Ege University"},{"author_name":"Ecem Sener","author_inst":"Ege University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.20043711","rel_title":"Estimating the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases manageable by a healthcare system","rel_date":"2020-03-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.20043711","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 Acute and Intense Resource Tool (CAIC-RT) is an interactive online tool capable of estimating the maximum daily number of incident COVID- 19 cases that a healthcare system could manage given age-based case distribution and severity.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasily Giannakeas","author_inst":"Women's College Research Institute, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Deepit Bhatia","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Matthew T.

There is no therapeutic treatment specific for COVID-19. It is highly desirable to identify potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 from existing drugs available for other diseases and, thus, repurpose them for treatment of COVID-19. In general, a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. Here we report a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions and its use in identifying drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The accurate FEP-ABFE predictions were based on the use of a new restraint energy distribution (RED) function designed to accelerate the FEP-ABFE calculations and make the practical FEP-ABFE-based virtual screening of the existing drug library possible for the first time. As a result, out of twenty-five drugs predicted, fifteen were confirmed as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The most potent one is dipyridamole (Ki=0.04 M) which has showed promising therapeutic effects in subsequently conducted clinical studies for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine (Ki=0.36 M) and chloroquine (Ki=0.56 M) were also found to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the first time. We anticipate that the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts.\n\nSignificance StatementDrug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. It has been demonstrated that a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions can reach an unprecedently high hit rate, leading to successful identification of 16 potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) from computationally selected 25 drugs under a threshold of Ki = 4 M. The outcomes of this study are valuable for not only drug repurposing to treat COVID-19, but also demonstrating the promising potential of the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhe Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xin Li","author_inst":"Ocean University of China"},{"author_name":"Yi-You Huang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Yaoxing Wu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Lingli Zhou","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Runduo Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Deyan Wu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Hao Liu","author_inst":"Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM)"},{"author_name":"Ximing Xu","author_inst":"Ocean University of China"},{"author_name":"Jun Cui","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Chang-Guo Zhan","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Ocean University of China"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.006544","rel_title":"Analysis of Serologic Cross-Reactivity Between Common Human Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 Using Coronavirus Antigen Microarray","rel_date":"2020-03-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.006544","rel_abs":"The current practice for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on PCR testing of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk.

Here, we describe the development of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates overall high IgG reactivity to common human coronaviruses and low IgG reactivity to epidemic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, with some cross-reactivity of conserved antigenic domains including S2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. This array can be used to answer outstanding questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, including whether baseline serology for other coronaviruses impacts disease course, how the antibody response to infection develops over time, and what antigens would be optimal for vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rie Nakajima","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Aarti Jain","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rafael Ramiro de Assis","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Alguimantas Jasinskas","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Joshua Miago Obiero","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Oluwasanmi Adenaiye","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Sheldon Tai","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Filbert Hong","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Donald K Milton","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Huw Davies","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Philip L Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"- Prometheus Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.002832","rel_title":"scRNA-seq reveals ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in TROP2+ Liver Progenitor Cells: Implications in COVID-19 associated Liver Dysfunction","rel_date":"2020-03-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.002832","rel_abs":"The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 was first reported in China (December 2019) and now prevalent in [~]170 countries across the globe. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into mammalian cells require the binding of viral Spike (S) proteins to the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor. Once entered the S protein is primed by a specialised serine protease, TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2) in the host cell. Importantly, beside respiratory symptoms, consistent with other common respiratory virus infection when patients become viraemic, a significant number of COVID-19 patients also develop liver comorbidities. We explored if specific target cell-type in the mammalian liver, could be implicated in disease pathophysiology other than the general deleterious response to cytokine storms. Here we employed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to survey the human liver and identified potentially implicated liver cell-type for viral ingress. We report the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a TROP2+ liver progenitor population. Importantly, we fail to detect the expression of ACE2 in hepatocyte or any other liver (immune and stromal) cell types. These results indicated that in COVID-19 associated liver dysfunction and cell death, viral infection of TROP2+ progenitors in liver may significantly impaired liver regeneration and could lead to pathology.\n\nHighlights- EPCAM+ Liver progenitors co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2\n- ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression is highest in TROP2high progenitors\n- ACE2 and TMPRSS2 cells express cholangiocyte biased fate markers\n- ACE2 and TMPRSS2 positive cells are absent in human fetal liver","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justine Jia Wen Seow","author_inst":"Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, 60 Biopolis Street, Genome, #02-01, Singapore 138672, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Rhea Pai","author_inst":"Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, 60 Biopolis Street, Genome, #02-01, Singapore 138672, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Archita Mishra","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), A*STAR, 8A Biomedical Grove, Immunos Building, Level 3 and 4, Singapore 138648, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Edwin Shepherdson","author_inst":"Department of Reproductive Medicine, KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Tony Kiat Hon Lim","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore 169608, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Brian K P Goh","author_inst":"Department of Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary and Transplant Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore 169608, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jerry KY Chan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Pierce KH Chow","author_inst":"Division of Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Centre, Singapore 169610, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Florent Ginhoux","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), A*STAR, 8A Biomedical Grove, Immunos Building, Level 3 and 4, Singapore 138648, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ramanuj DasGupta","author_inst":"Genome Institute of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ankur Sharma","author_inst":"Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, 60 Biopolis Street, Genome, #02-01, Singapore 138672, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Philip L Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"- Prometheus Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20038919","rel_title":"The impact of temperature and absolute humidity on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak - evidence from China","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20038919","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the impact of temperature and absolute humidity on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.

RESULTS The number of new confirm COVID-19 cases in mainland China peaked on Feb 1, 2020. COVID-19 daily incidence were lowest at -10  and highest at 10 ,while the maximum incidence was observed at the absolute humidity of approximately 7 g\/m3. COVID-19 incidence changed with temperature as daily incidence decreased when the temperature rose. No significant association between COVID-19 incidence and absolute humidity was observed in distributed lag nonlinear models. Additionally, A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model confirmed that transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature, leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak scale.

To dissect the underlying diseases that could impact on viral clearance, we enrolled 106 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China between Jan 5 and Feb 25, 2020. Methodology: We comprehensively analyzed demographic, clinical and laboratory data, as well as patient treatment records. Survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modelling were employed to identify factors influencing the viral clearance negatively. Results: We found that increasing age, male gender, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) associated factors (including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases) adversely affected the viral clearance. Furthermore, analysis by a random forest survival model pointed out hypertension, cortisone treatment, gender, and age as the four most important variables.

However, seldom study focused on confirmed and unconfirmed groups. Our aim was to compare clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside Hubei province between confirmed and unconfirmed group. Methods We retrospectively enrolled 163 consecutive adult patients with suspected COVID-19 from three tertiary hospitals in two provinces outside Hubei province from January 12, 2020 to February 13, 2020 and the differences in epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics between the two groups were compared. Results This study enrolled 163 patients with 62 confirmed cases and 101 unconfirmed cases. Most confirmed patients were clustered (31, 50.0%) and with definite epidemiological exposure. Symptoms of COVID-19 were nonspecific, largely fever and dry cough. Laboratory findings in confirmed group were characterized by normal or reduced white blood cell count, reduced the absolute value of lymphocytes, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and accelerated Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The typical chest CT imaging features of patients with confirmed COVID-19 were peripherally distributed multifocal GGO with predominance in the lower lung lobe. Compared with unconfirmed patients, confirmed patients had significantly higher proportion of dry cough, leucopenia, lymphopenia and accelerated ESR (P<0.05); but not with alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, and myoglobin (P>0.05). Proportion of peripheral, bilateral or lower lung distribution and multi-lobe involvement, GGO, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram and pleural thickening in the confirmed group were also higher (P<0.05).

The questions we address are these: (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much? (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity? (3) When should such strategies be implemented? Our answers are as follows: (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten. (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late. (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion that it exists and will soon be closed. Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation\/lockdown implemented in the next week at the latest. If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and then strong mitigation\/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too late.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergei Maslov","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Nigel Goldenfeld","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Mengdi Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huanwen Xiong","author_inst":"High-tech Hospital, First Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Peng Huang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Yichun city"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Li Miao","author_inst":"High-tech Hospital, First Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Du","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xinying Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peijie Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Hong","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, 171 65, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johanna F Lindahl","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Zoonosis Science Center, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041079","rel_title":"Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041079","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is straining healthcare resources worldwide, prompting social distancing measures to reduce transmission intensity.

Results. The actual number of infected cases in France is probably higher than the observations: we find here a factor x 8 (95%-CI: 5-12) which leads to an IFR in France of 0.5% (95%-CI: 0.3-0.8) based on hospital death counting data. Adjusting for the number of deaths in nursing homes, we obtain an IFR of 0.8% (95%-CI: 0.45-1.25). Conclusions.

This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between exposure of infector and infectee), serial interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19. Methods Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI. To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates. Additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (< 0.3 day). Depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented. Findings In total, 1155 cases from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Malaysia were included for the final analysis. The mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6.70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before symptom onset of infector) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before the symptom onsets of infectors. In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, symptom onsets of infectees occurred before those of infectors. Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed. Interpretation This study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. The findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggests a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shujuan Ma","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jiayue Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Minyan Zeng","author_inst":"Peking University Shenzhen Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingping Yun","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Wei Guo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yixiang Zheng","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shi Zhao","author_inst":"JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, the Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Maggie H Wang","author_inst":"JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, the Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Zuyao Yang","author_inst":"JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, the Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peijie Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Jiang Hong","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengning Ke","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"\u00c5ke Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, 171 65, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johanna F Lindahl","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Zoonosis Science Center, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20040121","rel_title":"Myocardial injury is associated with in-hospital mortality of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A single center retrospective cohort study","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20040121","rel_abs":"[Background] Since December 2019, a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread rapidly from China to other countries. In-hospital mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients are scarce. [Objectives] To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. [Methods] Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th February, 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. [Results] A total of 110 patients with confirmed (n=80) or suspected (n=30) COVID-19 were screened and 48 patients (female 31.3%, mean age 70.58{+\/-}13.38 year old) among them with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) test within 48 hours after admission were included, of whom 17 (17\/48, 35.4%) died in hospital while 31 (31\/48, 64.6%) were discharged or transferred to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was levated in 13 (13\/48, 27.1%) patents. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation (SpO2) on admission (HR 0.704, 95% CI 0.546-0.909, per 1% decrease, p=0.007), elevated hs-cTnI (HR 10.902, 95% 1.279-92.927, p=0.029) and elevated d-dimer (HR 1.103, 95%CI 1.034-1.176, per 1mg\/L increase, p=0.003) on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. [Conclusions] Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deyan Yang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Gao","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Taibo Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Kangan Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Quan Fang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Pan","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunfeng Yi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongru Fan","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liwei Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Fang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guowei Tian","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liqun He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20039867","rel_title":"A New, Simple Projection Model for COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20039867","rel_abs":"With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, an accurate model to predict how the coronavirus pandemic will evolve becomes important and urgent to help policy makers in different countries address the epidemic outbreak and determine policies to control spread more efficiently and effectively.

The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. In the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. Intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two ``zero\" points, respectively. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at a early stage of the outbreak. Method. To address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. Specially, we first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread, yielding four periods of the whole process corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two ``zero\" points. Then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. Finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the COVID-19 using the public available data for mainland China beyond Hubei Province from the China Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during the period of Jan 29th, 2020, to Feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. Results. Results show that our model can clearly outline the development of the epidemic at a very early stage. The first prediction results on Jan 29th reveal that the first and second milepost moments for mainland China beyond Hubei Province would appear on Jan 31st and Feb 14th respectively, which are only one day and three days behind the real world situations. Forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-late March, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-March and mid-April in mainland China beyond Hubei Province. The framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in counties where COVID-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huiwen Wang","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Beihang University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yanwen Zhang","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Beihang University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shan Lu","author_inst":"School of Statistics and Mathematics, Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Wang","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Taibo Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Kangan Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Quan Fang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical college, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Wan Pan","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunfeng Yi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongru Fan","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liwei Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Fang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guowei Tian","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liqun He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20034504","rel_title":"High risk of infection caused posttraumatic stress symptoms in individuals with poor sleep quality: A study on influence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20034504","rel_abs":"The influence of the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on mental health was poorly understood.

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged [&ge;]30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https:\/\/caliberresearch.org\/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. Findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged [&le;]70 years with [&ge;]1 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of [&ge;]2 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age>70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with [&ge;]3 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 80% in the UK population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. Interpretation: We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (do nothing) scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura Pasea","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Steve Harris","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Arturo Gonzalez-Izquierdo","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Ana Torralbo","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura Shallcross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Christina Pagel","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wai Keong Wong","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Claudia Langenberg","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bryan Williams","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Juan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guowei Tian","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liqun He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20031336","rel_title":"Characterizing occupations that cannot work from home: a means to identify susceptible worker groups during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20031336","rel_abs":"Objectives: Not all workers are employed in occupations in which working from home is possible. These workers are at an increased risk for exposure to infectious disease during a pandemic event, and are more likely to experience events of job displacement and disruption during all types of public health emergencies. Here, I characterized which occupational sectors in the United States are most able to work from home during a public health emergency such as COVID-19. Methods: 2018 national employment and wage data maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with measures from the BLS O*NET survey data. The measures utilized rank the importance of using a computer at work, and the importance of working with or performing for the public, which relate to the ability to complete work at home. Results: About 25% (35.6 M) of the U.S. workforce are employed in occupations which could be done from home, primarily in sectors such as technology, computer, management, administrative, financial, and engineering. The remaining 75% of U.S. workers (including healthcare, manufacturing, retail and food services, et al.) are employed in occupations where working from home would be difficult. Conclusions: The majority of U.S. workers are employed in occupations that cannot be done at home, putting 108.4 M U.S. workers at increased risk for adverse health outcomes related to working during a public health emergency. These workers tend to be lower paid than workers who can work from home. During COVID-19, this could result in a large increase in the burden of mental health disorders in the U.S., in addition to increased cases of COVID-19 due to workplace transmission. Public health guidance to work from home is not applicable to the majority of the U.S. workforce, emphasizing the need for additional guidance for workers during public health emergencies.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marissa G.

Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of COVID-19, but currently, there is no guidance on the management of cancer patients during this outbreak. Here, we report the infection control measures and early outcomes of patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer centre in Wuhan. Methods We reviewed all patients who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. This preceded the city lock-down date of Jan 23, 2020. Infection control measures were implemented, which included a clinical pathway for managing suspect COVID-19 cases, on-site screening, modifications to the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. Primary end-point was infection rate among patients and healthcare staff. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the 5th edition criteria. Findings 209 patients completed RT during the study period. Median age was 55 y (IQR = 48-64). Thoracic, head and neck, and lower gastrointestinal and gynaecological cancer patients consisted the majority of patients. Treatment sites included thoracic (38.3%), head and neck (25.4%), and abdomen and pelvis (25.8%); 47.4%, 27.3%, and 25.4% of treatments were for adjuvant, radical, and palliative indications, respectively. 188 treatments\/day were performed prior to the lock-down, in contrast to 12.4 treatments\/day post-lock-down. Only one (0.48%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. No healthcare worker was infected. Interpretation Herein, we show that in a susceptible population to COVID-19, strict infection control measures can curb human-to-human transmission, and ensure timely delivery of RT to cancer patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Conghua Xie","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyong Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhirong Bao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jing Yu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yahua Zhong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Melvin LK Chua","author_inst":"Division of Radiation Oncology, National Cancer Centre Singapore"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Christina Pagel","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wai Keong Wong","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Claudia Langenberg","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bryan Williams","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Juan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guowei Tian","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liqun He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20034041","rel_title":"First Clinical Study Using HCV Protease Inhibitor Danoprevir to Treat Naive and Experienced COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20034041","rel_abs":"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in China in January, 2020, repurposing approved drugs is emerging as important therapeutic options. We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo) is a potent HCV protease (NS3\/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study (NCT04291729) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naive and experienced COVID-19 patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naive and nine experienced, were discharged from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day).

As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines.

It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: All patients received recommended strategy from Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatments released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04275245. Findings: 17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3, 2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group, meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.005) and case severity (p=0.021) in patients. The time to virus negative in meplazumab group was reduced than that in control group (median 3, 95%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5]; p=0.045, HR=0.374, 95%CI[0.143-0.978]). The percentages of patients recovered to the normal lymphocyte count and CRP concentration were also increased remarkably and rapidly in meplazumab group. No adverse effect was found in meplazumab-treated patients. Interpretation: Meplazumab efficiently improved the recovery of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a favorable safety profile. Our results support to carry out a large-scale investigation of meplazumab as a treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.

This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew D.

ACE2, the receptor for entry into the target cells by SARS-CoV-2, was found to abundantly express in testes, including spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells. However, there is no clinical evidence about whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect male gonadal function so far. In this study, we compared the sex-related hormones between 81 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 100 age-matched healthy men, and found that serum luteinizing hormone (LH) was significantly increased, but the ratio of testosterone (T) to LH and the ratio of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to LH were dramatically decreased in males with COVID-19. Besides, multivariable regression analysis indicated that c-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly associated with serum T:LH ratio in COVID-19 patients. This study provides the first direct evidence about the influence of medical condition of COVID-19 on male sex hormones, alerting more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ling Ma","author_inst":"Reproductive Medicine Center, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University,"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Danyang Li","author_inst":"Reproductive Medicine Center, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University,"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Reproductive Medicine Center, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University,"},{"author_name":"Yanhong Mao","author_inst":"Reproductive Medicine Center, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University,"},{"author_name":"Yao Xiong","author_inst":"Reproductive Medicine Center, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University,"},{"author_name":"Yuanzhen Zhang","author_inst":"Reproductive Medicine Center, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University; Hubei Clinical Research Center for Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth Health; Department of Obstetr"},{"author_name":"Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Reproductive Medicine Center, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University; Hubei Clinical Research Center for Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth Health,"},{"author_name":"Phillip A Lewis","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Julian A Hiscox","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"David A Matthews","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bin Wang","author_inst":"National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine & Department of Cell Biology, Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiu-Xuan Sun","author_inst":"National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine & Department of Cell Biology, Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Min Yang","author_inst":"National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine & Department of Cell Biology, Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Lin","author_inst":"National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine & Department of Cell Biology, Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie-Jie Geng","author_inst":"National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine & Department of Cell Biology, Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ke Wang","author_inst":"National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine & Department of Cell Biology, Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong-Yong Cui","author_inst":"National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine & Department of Cell Biology, Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kui Zhang","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Chun Chen","author_inst":"Jiangsu Pacific Meinuoke Biopharmceuticals Co.

Here, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images to detect COVID-19 pneumonia features. Different from conventional medical AI, we were dealing with an epidemic crisis. Working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and \/ or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we were able to overcome a series of challenges in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID-19) from five hospitals, we were able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the test dataset, which included a variety of pulmonary diseases. Besides, the system automatically highlighted all lesion regions for faster examination.

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which has caused a global pandemic of respiratory illness called COVID-19, are still lacking. Methods: Our study (NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir\/ritonavir (LPV\/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild\/moderate COVID-19. Findings: This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild\/moderate COVID-19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV\/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoints, the average time of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and conversion rates at days 7 and 14, were similar between groups (all P>0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P>0.05). At day 7, eight (23.5%) patients in the LPV\/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group and 2(11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe\/critical(P =0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV\/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced adverse events during the follow-up period. No apparent adverse event occurred in the control group. Conclusions: LPV\/r or arbidol monotherapy present little benefit for improving the clinical outcome of patients hospitalized with mild\/moderate COVID-19 over supportive care.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yueping Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhiwei Xie","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weiyin Lin","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weiping Cai","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunyan Wen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yujuan Guan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoneng Mo","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yaping Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Peng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xudan Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenxin Hong","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangming Xiao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinxin Liu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lieguang Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengyu Hu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fuchun Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xilong Deng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Linghua Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Guo","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, School of Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Benqi Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, School of Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhizhong Ren","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, School of Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shuhao Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zheng You","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jiahong Dong","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, School of Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghuan Wang","author_inst":"Center for Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biliary and Pancreatic Surgery\/Cancer Research Center Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Techn"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Nan Chen","author_inst":"National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine & Department of Cell Biology, Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Zhu","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
