The generation of COVID-19-specific antibodies is essential for such tasks. Here we report that polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing animals with synthetic peptides corresponding to different areas of Nucleoprotein (N) of COVID-19. The specificities of the COVID-19 antibodies were assessed by Western Blot analysis against NPs from COVID-19, MERS and SARS. Antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry staining of the tissue sections from COVID-19 infected patient, as a potential diagnostic tool. A Sandwich ELISA kit was quickly assembled for quantitation of the virus\/NP of COVID-19 concentrations in the vaccine preparations. Development of POCT is also aggressively undergoing.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You'an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ya Peng","author_inst":"Laboratory of Animal Infectious Diseases, College of Animal Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Guangxi University"},{"author_name":"Cuiyan Wang","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Wenlin Ren","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Fudong Lv","author_inst":"Beijing You'an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sitao Gong","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Feng Fang","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Qianyun Wang","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Jianli Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Tong Shen","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Hunter Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yali Cui","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Northwest University"},{"author_name":"Hao Song","author_inst":"Research Network of Immunity and Health (RNIH), Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.23.20026864","rel_title":"Higher severity and mortality in male patients with COVID-19 independent of age and susceptibility","rel_date":"2020-02-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.23.20026864","rel_abs":"Importance: The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Disease (COVID-19) has put the world on alert, that is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak seventeen years ago. Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age ([&ge;]65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS. Conclusions and Relevance: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID. While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jian-Min Jin","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Bai","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fei Wu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Min Han","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shi Liu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jin-Kui Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qianyun Wang","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Jianli Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Tong Shen","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Hunter Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yali Cui","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Northwest University"},{"author_name":"Hao Song","author_inst":"Research Network of Immunity and Health (RNIH), Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.21.20026179","rel_title":"2019 Novel Coronavirus can be detected in urine, blood, anal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs samples","rel_date":"2020-02-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.21.20026179","rel_abs":"We tested samples collected from nine patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197\/276) and 57.2% (158\/276) respectively. By combining with real time RT-PCR detection, this assay might help to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuefei Cai","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jieli Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Quanxin Long","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haijun Deng","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kai Fan","author_inst":"PEG-Bio Biopharm Co.

Aim To reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, in Zhejiang, China. Design Retrospective case series. Methods 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. Results Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan\/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple. The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days. According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia. Conclusions Social activity cluster, family cluster and travel by airplane were how COVID-19 patients get transmitted and could be rapidly diagnosed COVID-19 in Zhejiang.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guo-Qing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nai-Bin Yang","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Ding","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Ada Hoi Yan Ma","author_inst":"University of Nottingham Ningbo China"},{"author_name":"Zong-Yi Wang","author_inst":"Ninghai County First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yue-Fei Shen","author_inst":"Xiaoshan District People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chun-Wei Shi","author_inst":"Xiaoshan District People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiang Lian","author_inst":"Xiangshan County People First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin-Guo Chu","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Yu Wang","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Da-Wei Ren","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guo-Xiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xue-Qin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua-Jiang Shen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Min Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Lin","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jihua Ren","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luyi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Gan","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the clinical characteristics of 128 COVID-19 cases with laboratory-confirmed from Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad during January 2020 to 16 February 2020. Results: Female patients account for 53.1%. The aged below 20 years that accounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The aged in 21~50, 51~65, over 66 years were accounts for 44.5%, 35.1%,18.8%, respectively. In the difference age spectrum, all severe groups compared with non-severe groups were difference significantly ( P < 0.01 ). Fever ( 89.8% ) and Cough ( 67.2% ) were common clinical symptoms. The rate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare. The rate of chest computed tomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall, non-severe, severe groups were 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. White blood cell counts in the normal range of overall patients, but severe group patients were increased significantly ( P < 0.01). Lymphocytes of overall patients were decreased. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in the normal range of overall patients, but its were elevated in the severe group. Creatinine (CR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of overall patients in the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level of all patients were increased markedly, but it in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group ( P < 0.01 ). Conclusions: Our data provide more information that advanced age, lower lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weiliang Cao","author_inst":"Xiangyang No1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nai-Bin Yang","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Ding","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Ada Hoi Yan Ma","author_inst":"University of Nottingham Ningbo China"},{"author_name":"Zong-Yi Wang","author_inst":"Ninghai County First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yue-Fei Shen","author_inst":"Xiaoshan District People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chun-Wei Shi","author_inst":"Xiaoshan District People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiang Lian","author_inst":"Xiangshan County People First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin-Guo Chu","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Yu Wang","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Da-Wei Ren","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guo-Xiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xue-Qin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua-Jiang Shen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Min Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Lin","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jihua Ren","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luyi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Gan","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks.

Based on the publicly available surveillance data, we identified 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong and estimated the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19. Methods: Index cases were identified and reported after symptoms onset, and contact tracing was conducted to collect the data of the associated secondary cases. An interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to fit a Gamma distribution function to govern the SI of COVID-19. Findings: Assuming a Gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9-6.7) and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8-5.8) by using the information of all 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong. Conclusion: The SI of COVID-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. Given the likelihood that SI could be shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are recommended in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shi Zhao","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Daozhou Gao","author_inst":"Shanghai Normal University"},{"author_name":"Zian Zhuang","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Marc Chong","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yongli Cai","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Jinjun Ran","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peihua Cao","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Xinjiang Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Lou","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Weiming Wang","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Lin Yang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Daihai He","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Maggie Wang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xue-Qin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua-Jiang Shen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Min Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Lin","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jihua Ren","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luyi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Gan","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

We found that the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period compared with deaths and cured cases for both COVID-19 and SARS. All the three types of SARS cases are later to saturate and have longer semi-saturation period than that of COVID-19.

H ere w e d escribe e fforts to compare epidemic growth, size and peaking time for countries in Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Australia in the early epidemic phase. Methods Using the time series of cases reported from January 20, 2020 to February 13, 2020 and transportation data from December 1, 2019 to January 23, 2020 we have built a novel time-varying growth model to predict the epidemic trend in China. We extended our method, using cases reported from January 26, 2020 - or the date of the earliest case reported, to April 9, 2020 to predict future epidemic trend and size in 41 countries. We estimated the impact of control measures on the epidemic trend. Results Our time-varying growth model yielded high concordance in the predicted epidemic size and trend with the observed figures in C hina. Among the other 41 countries, the peak time has been observed in 28 countries before or around April 9, 2020; the peak date and epidemic size were highly consistent with our estimates. We predicted the remaining countries would peak in April or May 2020, except India in July and Pakistan in August. The epidemic trajectory would reach the plateau in May or June for the majority of countries in the current wave. Countries that could emerge to be new epidemic centers are India, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia with a prediction of 105 cases for these countries. The effective reproduction number Rt displayed a downward trend with time across countries, revealing the impact of the intervention remeasures i.e. social distancing. Rt remained the highest in the UK (median 2.62) and the US (median 2.19) in the fourth week after the epidemic onset. Conclusions New epidemic centers are expected to continue to emerge across the whole world. Greater challenges such as those in the healthcare system would be faced by developing countries in hotspots. A domestic approach to curb the pandemic must align with joint international efforts to effectively control the spread of COVID-19. Our model promotes a reliable transmissibility characterization and epidemic forecasting using the incidence of cases in the early epidemic phase.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huazhen Lin","author_inst":"Southwestern University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Southwestern University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Southwestern University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Jinyu Nie","author_inst":"Southwestern University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Qiao Fan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Chengbin Xue","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Peihua Cao","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Xinjiang Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Lou","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Weiming Wang","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Lin Yang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Daihai He","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Maggie Wang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xue-Qin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua-Jiang Shen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Min Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Lin","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jihua Ren","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luyi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Gan","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

The geographic heterogeneity and associated intervention strategies highlight the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts. The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020 while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020 was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4 days (95% CI: 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6 days, Wilcoxon test, p<0.001). The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amna Tariq","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yiseul Lee","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kimberlyn Roosa","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Seth Blumberg","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Ping Yan","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Branch, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, Canada"},{"author_name":"Stefan Ma","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, Public Health Group, Ministry of Health Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Xinjiang Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Lou","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Weiming Wang","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Lin Yang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Daihai He","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Maggie Wang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xue-Qin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua-Jiang Shen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Min Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Lin","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jihua Ren","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luyi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Gan","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR=12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. A final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francisco Caramelo","author_inst":"Laboratory of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal; iCBR - Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical "},{"author_name":"Nuno Ferreira","author_inst":"iCBR - Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal; CIBIT - Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Im"},{"author_name":"Barbara Oliveiros","author_inst":"Laboratory of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal; iCBR - Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical "},{"author_name":"Seth Blumberg","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Ping Yan","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Branch, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, Canada"},{"author_name":"Stefan Ma","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, Public Health Group, Ministry of Health Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Xinjiang Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Lou","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Weiming Wang","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Lin Yang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Daihai He","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Maggie Wang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xue-Qin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua-Jiang Shen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Min Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Lin","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jihua Ren","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luyi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Gan","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using using International Air Transport Association (IATA) data. We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada. Time at risk estimates were based on a presumed 6 week epidemic age, and length of stay data for visitors to Iran derived from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination country rankings on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. UAE, Lebanon, and Canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019. We estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 to 53,470) COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing. Results were robust under varying assumptions about undiagnosed case numbers in Syria, Azerbaijan and Iraq. Even if it were assumed that all cases were identified in all countries with certainty, the \"best case\" outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts. Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashleigh R.

Pharmaceutical solutions based upon virologic studies, at this point, remain inconclusive, with no proven pharmaceutical solution so far. In contrast, this paper looks towards creating more accurate epidemiological models during this phase of viral growth in order to provide better feedback measures to public health officials and agencies, in particular, by providing a responsive, timely model of the R value based on the previous few days' results. Such an R value, although bearing less statistical precision due to limited sampling, could allow R to become a more effective, responsive standalone measure of infectious transmission. It demonstrates that the R value can be used as a dynamic, time-dependent indicator without the use of curve-fitting, and also estimates the most recent R-value of the CoViD-19 outbreak to be between 1.32 and 1.35.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yi Chen Chong","author_inst":"Independent"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sherbo","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Alexander Watts","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"David N.

The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. Materials and Methods We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. Based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based CT diagnosis system (DeepPneumonia) was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. Results The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from others with an excellent AUC of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. In addition, our model was capable of discriminating the COVID-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an AUC of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. Moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis. The diagnosis for a patient could be finished in 30 seconds, and the implementation on Tianhe-2 supercompueter enables a parallel executions of thousands of tasks simultaneously. An online server is available for online diagnoses with CT images by http:\/\/biomed.nscc-gz.cn\/server\/Ncov2019. Conclusions The established models can achieve a rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 in human samples, thereby allowing identification of patients.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ying Song","author_inst":"National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou  510006, China"},{"author_name":"Shuangjia Zheng","author_inst":"National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou  510006, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510220, China"},{"author_name":"Ziwang Huang","author_inst":"School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China"},{"author_name":"Jianwen Chen","author_inst":"School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China"},{"author_name":"Huiying Zhao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yusheng Jie","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Ruixuan Wang","author_inst":"School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China"},{"author_name":"Yutian Chong","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510220, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Shen","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Yunfei Zha","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China"},{"author_name":"Yuedong Yang","author_inst":"School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Guo","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yihui Wen","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Wenxiang Gao","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Ying Zheng","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yun Li","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Li Ling","author_inst":"Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Lei","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yiqiong Ma","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Bo Diao","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of Central Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Lv","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jili Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Liang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wenduo Bu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Huiling Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Sihao Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lianhua Yang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University,"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Guohua Ding","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Bo Shen","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Huiming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Guo","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yihui Wen","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Wenxiang Gao","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Ying Zheng","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yun Li","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Li Ling","author_inst":"Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Lei","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

This new type of pneumonia is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Among the different disease types, cancer patients are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance, and the majority of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive. This prompts us to consider if cancer patients were at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at our tertiary cancer institution-Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020. It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Yu","author_inst":"Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Melvin L.K.

The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes.

SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lin Yu","author_inst":"Applied Biology Laboratory, Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, 110142, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Wu","author_inst":"Applied Biology Laboratory, Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, 110142, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowen Hao","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 430074 Wuhan, Hubei, Ch"},{"author_name":"Xuelong Li","author_inst":"Applied Biology Laboratory, Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, 110142, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Xiyang Liu","author_inst":"Biotech & Biomedicine Science Co.

It again indicates bats are the natural reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission to animals and humans by recombination and\/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 [A] and 2.83 [A] resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of -, {beta}-, {gamma}-, and {delta}-coronavirus spikes. The results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2\/SADS-CoV are probably the most ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2\/SADS-CoV S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 \/SADS-CoV and {beta}-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinfang Yu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Shuyuan Qiao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Runyu Guo","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiyang Liu","author_inst":"Biotech & Biomedicine Science Co.

Here, we analysed the laboratory data based on clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, in parallel comparison with non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases, in an attempt to elucidate the key pathological features of COVID-19 during its infection of the human body. Methods: We analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation in COVID-19 patients, and compare these data from non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes in COVID-19 patients. Results: The study enrolled 110 patients, comprising 88 COVID-19 patients and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR, and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients. Conclusions: The study indicates significantly different clinical features between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-caused and non-2019-nCoV-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury. Notably, correlation analysis demonstrates that tissue damage in COVID-19 patients is attributed to virus infection itself rather than uncontrolled inflammatory responses (\"cytokine storm\"). These findings provide new insights for developing efficient therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yishan Zheng","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Zhen Huang","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Guoping Ying","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Xia Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Wei Ye","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Zhiliang Hu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Chunmei Hu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Hongxia Wei","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Yi Zeng","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Yun Chi","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Cong Cheng","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Feishen Lin","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Hu Lu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Lingyan Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Chunming Wang","author_inst":"University of Macau"},{"author_name":"Yongxiang Yi","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing"},{"author_name":"Lei Dong","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Ying Zheng","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yun Li","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Li Ling","author_inst":"Department of Medical Statistics, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Lei","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Institute of otolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzh"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. Results The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Mei Li","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Lan Yi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qianhui Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Liang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiling Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Ira M.

Design: A retrospective descriptive study Setting: China Participants: Epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis. Main outcome measure: Prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis. Results: COVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where >50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days). By February 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5\/265), 89.8%(238\/265), 3.8%(10\/265), 4.5%(12\/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died. Conclusion: Strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset. Multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been observed before significant respiratory dysfunction.

A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread. Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city. Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinhua Pan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ye Yao","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhixi Liu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Mengyi Li","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Weizhen Dong","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Haidong Kan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Weibing Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Ling","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongping Qu","author_inst":"Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yuan Gao","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yingchuan Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kanglong Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Duming Zhu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hecheng Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Rui Tian","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mei Zeng","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qiang Li","author_inst":"Shanghai East Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanlin Song","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiangyang Li","author_inst":"Huadong Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jinfu Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Mao","author_inst":"Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Bijie Hu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Li","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wenhong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100\/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75\/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age [&ge;] 60 years and CRP [&ge;] 34 mg\/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age [&ge;] 60 years and CRP < 34 mg\/L; age < 60 years and CRP [&ge;] 34 mg\/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age < 60 years and CRP < 34 mg\/L, 0%) (P <0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiatao Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shufang Hu","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Rong Fan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Liu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xueru Yin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Qiongya Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qingquan Lv","author_inst":"Department of Medical Affairs, Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhifang Cai","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Diseases, Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Haijun Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yuhai Hu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Ying Han","author_inst":"Department of Nursing, Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Hongping Hu","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Wenyong Gao","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shibo Feng","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedics, Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qiongfang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Nosocomial Infection Administration, Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Li","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Sun","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Peng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xuefeng Yi","author_inst":"Health Commission of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Zixiao Zhou","author_inst":"Health Commission of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yabing Guo","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Hou","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Mao","author_inst":"Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Bijie Hu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Li","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wenhong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.
