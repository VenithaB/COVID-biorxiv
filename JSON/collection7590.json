The duration of scholarly journals\u2019 publication process is one of the main factors hindering quick delivery of new information. While proper editorial assessment and peer review obviously require some time, turnaround times for medical journals can be up to several months, which is undesirable in the era of a crisis. Following initiatives of medical journals and scholarly publishers to accelerate their publication process, this study assesses whether medical journals have indeed managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles. It studies the duration of 14 medical journals\u2019 publication process both during and prior to the current pandemic. Assessing a total of 669 articles, the study concludes that medical journals have indeed drastically accelerated the publication process for Covid-19 related articles since the outbreak of the pandemic. Compared to articles published in the same journals before the pandemic, turnaround times have decreased on average by 49%. The largest decrease in number of days between submission and publication of articles was due to a decrease in the number of days required for peer review. For articles not related to Covid-19, no acceleration of the publication process is found. While the acceleration of journals\u2019 publication process is laudable from the perspective of quick information dissemination, it also raises concerns relating to the quality of the peer review process and the quality of the resulting publications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Serge P.J.M.

The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of 2019-nCov into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of 2019-nCov. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCoV. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus. However, report about the expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited.Methods In order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level.Results The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results.Conclusions Based on these findings, we speculated that 2019-nCov could effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to 2019-nCov, which provides valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhong Mei","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lin Bingpeng","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gao Hongbin","author_inst":"Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute"},{"author_name":"Wang Xinhong","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liu Chang","author_inst":"Stomatology school of Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Wu Kaibin","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liu Mingxiao","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chen Jianming","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huang Jiang-yong","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lee Learn-han","author_inst":"Monash University Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Qi Cuiling","author_inst":"Guangdong Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Ge Linhu","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wang Lijing","author_inst":"Vascular Biology Research Institute, School of Life Sciences and Biopharmaceutics, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063784","rel_title":"Comparative dynamic aerosol efficiencies of three emergent coronaviruses and the unusual persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol suspensions","rel_date":"2020-04-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063784","rel_abs":"The emergent coronavirus, designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a zoonotic pathogen that has demonstrated remarkable transmissibility in the human population and is the etiological agent of a current global pandemic called COVID-19.

DESIGN: This is the protocol of a living systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We will conduct searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case we find no direct evidence from randomised trials, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.

In some jurisdictions, over 10% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been found among healthcare workers. Aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) may increase the risk of nosocomial transmission, exacerbated by present global shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Improved methods for mitigating risk during AGMPs are therefore urgently needed. Methods The Aerosol Containment Enclosure (ACE) was constructed from acrylic with silicone gaskets for arm port seals and completed with a thin plastic sheet. Hospital wall suction generated negative pressure within the ACE. To evaluate protective capability, differential pressures were recorded under static conditions and during simulated AGMPs. Smoke flow patterns, fluorescence aerosolization, and sodium saccharin aerosolization tests were also conducted. Results Negative pressures of up to -47.7 mmH2O were obtained using the enclosure with two wall suction units (combined outflow of 70 L min-1), with inflow of O2 of 15 L min-1. Negative pressures between -10 and -35 mmH2O were maintained during simulated AGMPs, including oxygen delivery by mask, airway suctioning, bag-mask manual ventilation and endotracheal intubation of a potential COVID-19 patient. The ACE effectively contained smoke, fluorescein aerosol, and sodium saccharin aerosol within the enclosure during use. Conclusions The ACE is capable of maintaining negative pressure during simulated AGMPs. In all cases, containment was improved relative to an identical enclosure with non-occluded ports at ambient pressure. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the use of such a device may assist in reducing nosocomial infections among healthcare providers.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony M.

A strategy is needed such that both the health system is not overloaded letting people die in an uncontrolled way and also such that the majority of people can get back their social contacts as soon as possible. We investigate the potential effects of a combination of measures such as continuation of hygienic constraints after leaving lockdown, isolation of infectious persons, repeated and adaptive short-term contact reductions and also large-scale use of antibody tests in order to know who can be assumed to be immune and participate at public life without constraints. We apply two commonly used modeling approaches: extended SEIR models formulated both as System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation, in order to get insight into the disease dynamics of a complete country like Germany and also into more detailed behavior of smaller regions. We confirm the findings of other models that without intervention the consequences of the pandemic can be catastrophic and we extend such findings with effective strategies to overcome the challenge. Based on the modeling assumptions it can be expected that repeated short-term contact reductions will be necessary in the next years to avoid overload of the health system and that on the other side herd immunity can be achieved and antibody tests are an effective way to mitigate the contact reductions for many.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reinhard German","author_inst":"University of Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Anatoli Djanatliev","author_inst":"University of Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Lisa Maile","author_inst":"University of Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Peter Bazan","author_inst":"University of Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Holger Hackstein","author_inst":"University Hospital Erlangen"},{"author_name":"Ken S.

The group focused on comorbidities and temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 27,584 COVID-19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory trajectories were concordant with existing literature.

High serum levels of IL-6 and an immune hyperresponsiveness referred to as a cytokine storm have been associated with poor clinical outcome. Despite the large numbers of cases and deaths, information on the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells is scarce. Here, we detected SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 100% and 80% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. We also detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in 20% of the healthy controls, not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and indicative of cross-reactivity due to infection with common cold coronaviruses. Strongest T-cell responses were directed to the surface glycoprotein (spike, S), and SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells predominantly produced effector and Th1 cytokines, although Th2 and Th17 cytokines were also detected. Collectively, these data stimulate further studies into the role of T-cells in COVID-19, support vaccine design and facilitate the evaluation of vaccine candidate immunogenicity.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniela Weiskopf","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Disease, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA92037, USA"},{"author_name":"Katharina S.

This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 43.2% (95% CI 32.2-54.7%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic. The mean serial interval was 6.9 days (95% CI 2.6-13.4). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load (as measured by genome equivalents inferred from cycle threshold data) of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.6 and 0.2 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lockdown or from asymptomatic infections living in the same household. This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics, the duration of viral load detectability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enrico Lavezzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Elisa Franchin","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Constanze Ciavarella","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Luisa Barzon","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Claudia Del Vecchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lucia Rossi","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Manganelli","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Arianna Loregian","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Nicol\u00f2 Navarin","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their healthcare systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policymakers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina (NC) and the Charlotte metropolitan region and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread, while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. Methods: Using the software package R, three SIR models were fit to infection prevalence data from the state and the greater Charlotte region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-Int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. We computed longitudinal total estimates of the susceptible, infected, and removed compartments of both populations, along with other pandemic characteristics (e.g., basic reproduction number). Results: Prior to March 26, disease spread was rapid at the pandemic onset with the Charlotte region doubling time of 2.56 days (95% CI: (2.11, 3.25)) and in NC 2.94 days (95% CI: (2.33, 4.00)). Subsequently, disease spread significantly slowed with doubling times increased in the Charlotte region to 4.70 days (95% CI: (3.77, 6.22)) and in NC to 4.01 days (95% CI: (3.43, 4.83)). Reflecting spatial differences, this deceleration favored the greater Charlotte region compared to NC as a whole. A comparison of the efficacy of intervention, defined as 1 - the hazard ratio of infection, gave 0.25 for NC and 0.43 for the Charlotte region. Also, early in the pandemic, the initial basic SIR model had good fit to the data; however, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-Int model emerged as the model with better fit. Conclusions: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policymakers, public health officials and health systems to proactively plan capacity and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-Int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated the efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip J.

We use a SEIR model that includes three different compartments of infection: those who can stay at home, those in regular hospital beds and those in need of ICU treatment. The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of one semester. The model predicts that by mid October 2020, the city will need 4 524 prevalent ICUs needed and 16 738 regular hospital beds needed. By the third week of July 2020, the number of patients that need ICUs will overpass the capacity set at 1 200 beds for ICU hospital beds in the city. The model predicts that the death toll by the same date will reach 1 752 people and the number of cases will be 30 216 inhabitants by then.

The objective of this paper is to study whether the number of deaths not registered as covid-19-related has increased compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic. This may be a result of some covid-19 deaths being unreported or spillover effects on other causes of death (or both). Reasons behind this might include covid-19 underreporting, avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. Methods: I used weekly ONS data on the number of deaths in England and Wales that did not officially involve covid-19 over the period 2015-2020. Simply observing trends is not sufficient as spikes in deaths may occasionally occur. I thus followed a differences-in-differences econometric approach to study whether there was a relative increase in deaths not registered as covid-19-related during the pandemic, compared to a control. As an additional approach, an interrupted time series model was also used. Results: Results suggest that there are an additional 968 weekly deaths that officially did not involve covid-19, compared to what would have otherwise been expected. This increase is also confirmed by the interrupted time series analysis. Discussion: The number of deaths not officially involving covid-19 has demonstrated an absolute and relative increase during the pandemic. It is possible that some people are dying from covid-19 without being diagnosed, and that there are excess deaths due to other causes as a result of the pandemic. Analysing the cause of death for any excess non-covid-19 deaths will shed light upon the reasons for the increase in such deaths and will help design appropriate policy responses to save lives.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sotiris Vandoros","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Piedad Urdinola","author_inst":"National University of Colombia"},{"author_name":"Marc A.

Understanding what proportion of these patients require screening, who can be safely screened in community based models of care, and who requires an emergency departments to care for them is critical for workforce and infrastructure planning across the healthcare system, as well as public messaging campaigns. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, we screened patients presenting to a SARS-CoV-2 screening clinic in a tertiary hospital Emergency Department in Melbourne, Australia. We assessed the proportion of patients who met screening criteria; self-reported symptom severity; reasons why they came to the ED for screening; views on community-based models of care; and sources of information accessed about COVID-19. Results: We included findings from 1846 patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for COVID-19 screening from 18th to 30th March 2020. Most patients (55.3%) did not meet criteria for screening and most (57.6%) had mild or no (13.4%) symptoms. The main reason for coming to the ED was being referred by a telephone health service (31.3%) and 136 (7.4%) said they tried to contact their GP but could not get an appointment. Only 47 (2.6%) said they thought the disease was too specialized for their GP to manage. Patients accessed numerous information sources, commonly government websites (68.4%) and other websites (51.3%) for COVID-19 information. Conclusions: if we are to ensure that emergency departments can cope with the likely surge in presentations requiring resuscitation or inpatient care COVID-19, we should strengthen access to alternative services to triage patients to prevent unnecessary presentations at health services, and to direct those who are well but require screening away from EDs.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda Rojek","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Martin Dutch","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Daniel Peyton","author_inst":"Murdoch Children's Research Institute & University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Rachel Pelly","author_inst":"Murdoch Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark Putland","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Harriet Hiscock","author_inst":"Murdoch Children's Research Institute, University of Melbourne,and Royal Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Knott","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital & University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

This study sought to apply meta-analysis to more precisely and accurately estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the isolation policy across countries, and the corresponding public health capability to care for patients. Prior estimates of R0 have varied widely and range from 1.95 to 6.49. Utilizing meta-analysis techniques we determined a more robust estimation of 3.05 for R0, which is substantially larger than that provided by the WHO. We also present the infectious rate standardized to per million population, which has proved to be a good index to determine whether the isolation measures in specific countries are effective. Also, this standardized infection rate can be used to determine whether the current infectious severity status is out of range of the national health capacity. Finally, we utilize our robust estimate of R0 and the standardized infectious rate to illustrate that the early and aggressive isolation measures enforced by the Chinese government were substantially more effective in controlling the negative impact COVID-19 than the more permissive measures enacted early in Italy and the United States.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianghu Dong","author_inst":"College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yongdao Zhou","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Douglas Franz","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mark Putland","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Harriet Hiscock","author_inst":"Murdoch Children's Research Institute, University of Melbourne,and Royal Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Knott","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital & University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

Methodology: This prospective study included 78 ISOA patients who fulfilled a patient-reported outcome questionnaire and underwent a nasopharyngeal swabs. Among these, 46 patients performed psychophysical olfactory evaluation using sniffing tests. Based on the duration of the ISOA, two groups of patients were compared: patients with anosmia duration [&le;]12 days (group 1) and those with duration >12 days (group 2). Results: Among group 1, 42 patients (87.5%) had a positive viral load regarding RT-PCR while 6 patients (12.5%) were negative. In group 2, 7 patients (23%) had a positive viral load and 23 patients (77%) were negative. Among the 46 patients having performed a psychophysical olfactory evaluation, we observed anosmia in 52% (N=24), hyposmia in 24% (N=11) and normosmia in 24% (N=11) of patients. The viral load significantly decreased throughout the 14-days following the onset of the olfactory disorder. Conclusions: Our results support that a high proportion of ISOA patients are Covid+. Our study supports the need to add anosmia to the list of symptoms used in screening tools for possible COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"jerome lechien","author_inst":"UMONS"},{"author_name":"pierre cabaraux","author_inst":"CHU Marie-Curie"},{"author_name":"carlos chiesa-estomba","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain."},{"author_name":"mohammad khalife","author_inst":"Epicura"},{"author_name":"jan plzak","author_inst":"University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic."},{"author_name":"stephane hans","author_inst":"Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"delphine martiny","author_inst":"Laboratoire Hospitalier Universitaire de Bruxelles - Universitair Laboratorium Brussel (LHUB-ULB), Brussels, Belgium"},{"author_name":"christian Henriquez","author_inst":"Department of otolaryngology-Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain."},{"author_name":"Claire hopkins","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"sven saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

For this response to be most effective, it must reflect an evidence-based, pan-Canadian response. We designed four different prototypical patients with a combination of common COVID-19 symptoms and opportunities for exposure who were made to self-assess using the 10 provincial COVID-19 self-assessment tools on 1 April. These tools were developed to allow individuals to self-triage, allowing health systems direct capacity to testing and care. We assessed the consistency of the self-assessment tools and of the guidance provided to the patients. While the tools generally screen in three areas, the scope of included COVID-19 associated symptoms as well as the opportunities for exposure, and therefore transmission, vary between provinces such that no two provinces screened in the same way. This was, in turn, reflected in the inconsistency in guidance found. A patient with cough who had travelled abroad or had close contact with a confirmed case within 14 days received the most consistent guidance, with remaining patients receiving guidance ranging from mandatory quarantine or self-isolation to being told they did not have COVID-19 symptoms, guidance at odds with medical evidence. Thus, there is not a single, evidence-based Canadian standard of care simply for self-assessment. Without consistency in public health guidance, Canadians cannot appropriately self-isolate to mitigate community transmission, nor can the necessary valid and reliable data be collected to inform critical epidemiological models that help guide pandemic response. If federal and provincial governments are unable to coordinate a response, Parliament must use its available jurisdiction to legislate a duty on both to follow national standards, so as to improve coordination on COVID-19 in coming months.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brieanne Olibris","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Amir Attaran","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"carlos chiesa-estomba","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain."},{"author_name":"mohammad khalife","author_inst":"Epicura"},{"author_name":"jan plzak","author_inst":"University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic."},{"author_name":"stephane hans","author_inst":"Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"delphine martiny","author_inst":"Laboratoire Hospitalier Universitaire de Bruxelles - Universitair Laboratorium Brussel (LHUB-ULB), Brussels, Belgium"},{"author_name":"christian Henriquez","author_inst":"Department of otolaryngology-Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain."},{"author_name":"Claire hopkins","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"sven saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

In the early phases of a new pandemic, identifying the most relevant evidence and quantifying which studies are shared the most can help researchers and policy makers. The aim of this study is to describe and quantify the impact of early scientific production in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. The study consisted of: 1) review of the scientific literature produced in the first 30 days since the first COVID-19 paper was published; 2) analysis of papers' metrics with the construction of a Computed-Impact-Score (CIS) that represents a unifying score over heterogeneous bibliometric indicators. In this study we use metrics and alternative metrics collected into five separate categories. On top of those categories we compute the CIS. Highest CIS papers are further analyzed. Results. 239 papers have been included in the study. The mean of citations, mentions and social media interactions resulted in 1.63, 10 and 1250, respectively. The paper with highest CIS resulted \"Clinical features of patients[...]\" by Chaolin Huang et al., which rated first also in citations and mentions. This is the first paper describing patients affected by the new disease and reporting data that are clearly of great interest to both the scientific community and the general population. Conclusions. The early response of scientific literature during an epidemic does not follow a pre- established pattern. Being able to monitor how communications spread from the scientific world toward the general population using both traditional and alternative metric measures is essential, especially in the early stages of a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davide Golinelli","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese","author_inst":"STLab, ISTC-CNR."},{"author_name":"Erik Boetto","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Flavia Rallo","author_inst":"DIBINEM, University of Bologna."},{"author_name":"Manfredi Greco","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Toscano","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center.

In most academic hospitals in the United States, inpatient rotations are designed to deliver optimal patient care by staggering rotations of attendings and house-staff, and much emphasis is placed on HCW burnout, yet during a pandemic preventing further infection is the single most important factor. Our purpose was to model various inpatient rotation schedules of physicians and nurses to determine patterns associated with optimal workforce preservation and lower nosocomial infections in settings in which personal protective equipment is imperfect or unavailable. Summary of Methods: We simulated the spread of COVID-19 in hospital wards using Monte Carlo methods. Universal model parameters for COVID-19 included incubation period distribution and latent period distribution. Situation-dependent COVID-19 model parameters included pre-admission infection probability, team member infection probability, physician-to-patient, nurse-to-patient, patient-to-physician, patient-to-nurse, and HCW-to-HCW transmission probabilities, team member absence after symptom onset, daily SARS-CoV-2 exposure probability of team members (e.g. via exposure to other staff), length of admission after COVID-19 symptoms, and length of simulation time. Model parameters that varied by hospital setting and service type included average patient load per team, average patient hospitalization, and number of physicians and nurses on a team and on duty. Results: The primary outcome measure was probability of team failure, defined as the likelihood that at some point there are insufficient attendings, house-staff or nurses to staff a fully functioning floor. In all of our simulations, physician and nurse rotation lengths of 1-3 days led to higher team failure rates. Nursing shifts of 12 versus 8 hours and avoiding staggering of physician rotations also decreased the chance of team failure. Conclusions: Simple changes in staff scheduling, such as lengthening nursing shifts or avoiding rotations that are either staggered or last fewer than three days, can result in improved workforce preservation. These workforce scheduling changes are easy to implement.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan M Kluger","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yariv Aizenbud","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Yale University"},{"author_name":"Ariel Jaffe","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Yale University"},{"author_name":"Lilach Aizenbud","author_inst":"Yale Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Fabio Parisi","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Eyal Minsky-Fenick","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics Program, Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M Kluger","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelli Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harriet M Kluger","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuval Kluger","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

COVID-19 is a pandemic with no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines. The urgent needs for exploring the neutralizing antibodies from patients with different clinical characteristics are emerging. Methods. A total of 117 blood samples were collected from 70 COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients. The presence of neutralizing antibody was determined with a modified cytopathogenic assay based on live SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of neutralizing antibody levels at different with different clinical characteristics were analyzed. Results. The seropositivity rate reached up to 100.0% within 20 days since onset, and remained 100.0% till day 41-53. The total GMT was 1:163.7 (95% CI, 128.5 to 208.6), and the antibody level was highest during day 31-40 since onset, and then decreased slightly. Individual differences in changes of antibody levels were observed among 8 representative convalescent patients. In multivariate GEE analysis, patients at age of 31-60 and 61-84 had a higher antibody level than those at age of 16-30 ({beta}=1.0518, P=0.0152; {beta}=1.3718, P=0.0020). Patients with a worse clinical classification had a higher antibody titer ({beta}=0.4639, P=0.0227). Conclusions. The neutralizing antibodies were detected even at the early stage of disease, and a significant response showed in convalescent patients. Moreover, changes on antibody levels ware individual specific.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoli Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing, China;School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xianghua Guo","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Qianqian Xin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Pan","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing, China;School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yanhui Chu","author_inst":"Xicheng District Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingmei Feng","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Quanyi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing, China;School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Harriet M Kluger","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuval Kluger","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

A third virus, the H5N1, responsible for avian influenza, has caused infection with some clinical similarities to those in COVID-19 infections. Cytokines, small proteins that modulate immune responses, have been directly implicated in some of the severe responses seen in COVID-19 patients, e.g. cytokine storms. Understanding the immune processes related to COVID-19, and other similar infections, could help identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Here we examine data of cytokine, immune cell types, and disease associations captured from biomedical literature associated with coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1 influenza, with the objective of identifying potentially useful relationships and areas for future research. Cytokine and cell-type associations captured from MeSH terms linked to thousands of PubMed abstracts, has identified differing patterns of associations between the three corpuses of abstracts (coronavirus, SARS, or H5N1 influenza). Clustering of cytokine-disease co-occurrences in the context of coronavirus has identified compelling clusters of co-morbidities and symptoms, some of which already known to be linked to COVID-19. Finally, network analysis identified sub-networks of cytokines and immune cell types associated with different manifestations, co-morbidities and symptoms of coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1. Systematic review of research in medicine is essential to facilitate evidence-based choices about health interventions. In a fast moving pandemic the approach taken here will identify trends and enable rapid comparison to the literature of related diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nophar Geifman","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Anthony D Whetton","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Qianqian Xin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Pan","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing, China;School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yanhui Chu","author_inst":"Xicheng District Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingmei Feng","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Quanyi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing, China;School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Harriet M Kluger","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuval Kluger","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

Here, we present the first results of the analyses that we have performed on 34 PM10 samples of outdoor\/airborne PM10 from an industrial site of Bergamo Province, collected with two different air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period, from February 21st to March 13th. We can confirm to have reasonably demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by detecting highly specific RtDR gene on 8 filters in two parallel PCR analyses. This is the first preliminary evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be present on outdoor particulate matter, thus suggesting that, in conditions of atmospheric stability and high concentrations of PM, SARS-CoV-2 could create clusters with outdoor PM and, by reducing their diffusion coefficient, enhance the persistence of the virus in the atmosphere. Further confirmations of this preliminary evidence are ongoing, and should include real-time assessment about the vitality of the SARS-CoV-2 as well as its virulence when adsorbed on particulate matter. At the present, no assumptions can be made concerning the correlation between the presence of the virus on PM and COVID-19 outbreak progression. Other issues to be specifically addressed are the average concentrations of PM eventually required for a potential boost effect of the contagion (in case it is confirmed that PM might act as a carrier for the viral droplet nuclei), or even the theoretic possibility of immunization consequent to minimal dose exposures at lower thresholds of PM.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonardo Setti","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Passarini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Gianluigi De Gennaro","author_inst":"University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pierluigi Baribieri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maria Grazia Perrone","author_inst":"Environmental Research Division, TCR TECORA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Borelli","author_inst":"University of Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Jolanda Palmisani","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Alessia Di Gilio","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Valentina Torboli","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Alberto Pallavicini","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Ruscio","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Giuliano Isontina (ASU GI), Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"ISBEM"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, SIMA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

It is shown that the model exhibits a backward bifurcation at R0 = 1 when recovered individuals do not develop a permanent immunity for the disease. In the absence of reinfection, it is proved that the model is without backward bifurcation and the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for R0 < 1. By using available data, the model is validated and parameter values are estimated. The sensitivity of the value of R0 to changes in any of the parameter values involved in its formula is analysed. Moreover, various mitigation strategies are investigated using the proposed model and it is observed that the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals may play a major role in the re-emergence of the disease in the future. Therefore, it is recommended that in the absence of vaccination, countries need to develop capacities to detect and isolate at least 30% of the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals while treating in isolation at least 50% of symptomatic patients to control the disease.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Semu Kassa","author_inst":"Botswana International University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hatson John Boscoh Njagarah","author_inst":"Botswana International University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yibeltal Adane Terefe","author_inst":"University of Limpopo"},{"author_name":"Pierluigi Baribieri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maria Grazia Perrone","author_inst":"Environmental Research Division, TCR TECORA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Borelli","author_inst":"University of Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Jolanda Palmisani","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Alessia Di Gilio","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Valentina Torboli","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Alberto Pallavicini","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Ruscio","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Giuliano Isontina (ASU GI), Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"ISBEM"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, SIMA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

METHOD Pearson correlation and generalized additive modeling were performed to assess the relationships between daily new COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative humidity) with the most updated data currently available. RESULTS The Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were more correlated with the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated with the average temperature in Beijing (r=-0.565, P<0.01), Shanghai (r=-0.471, P<0.01), and Guangzhou (r=-0.530, P<0.01) , yet in contrast, positively correlated with that in Japan (r=0.441, P<0.01). In most of the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), generalized additive modeling analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases was positively associated with both average temperature and relative humidity, especially in lagged 3d model, where a positive influence of temperature on the daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities except in Beijing, Wuhan, Korea, and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent across cities and lagged time, suggesting meteorological factors were unlikely to greatly influence the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION The associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and lagged time. Large-scale public health measures and expanded regional research are still required until a vaccine becomes available and herd immunity is established.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zonglin He","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Yiqiao Chin","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Jian Huang","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yi He","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Babatunde O.

However, the social distancing practices from the COVID-19 pandemic is causing social disruption on a grand scale, potentially causing poor health outcomes. Through Google Trends analysis, we found a COVID-19-related surge in interest surrounding loneliness. We assessed if social isolation and loneliness increase the risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (ICD-10: I00-I99) and used the data to create a conceptual framework. Using the 10-year overall and cardiovascular mortality follow-up data (n = 12,019) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2008), we conducted survival analyses and found that individuals who experience social isolation or loneliness have a significantly higher likelihood of overall and CVD mortality than those without support. These effects generally remained strong with further adjustment for NHANES-detected health and demographic differences showing the need to address COVID-19 related loneliness through increasing social nearing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sri Banerjee","author_inst":"Walden University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gary Burkholder","author_inst":"Walden University School of Psychology"},{"author_name":"Beyan Sana","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 team"},{"author_name":"Mihalyi Szirony","author_inst":"Walden University School of Counseling"},{"author_name":"Babatunde O.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antiviral, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by Rc), is less than unity. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy greater than or equal to 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19. Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Calistus N Ngonghala","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Enahoro Iboi","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Steffen Eikenberry","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Scotch","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Chandini Raina MacIntyre","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Matthew H Bonds","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Abba B Gumel","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Wai-kit Ming","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Valentina Torboli","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Alberto Pallavicini","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Ruscio","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Giuliano Isontina (ASU GI), Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"ISBEM"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, SIMA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

Method: Based on individual case data published online by 21 cities of China, we investigated a total of 136 COVID19 patients who traveled to Hubei from 21 cities of China between January 5 and January 31, 2020, remained there for 48 hours or less, and returned to these cities with onset of symptoms between January 10 and February 6, 2020. Among these patients, 110 were found to be aged 15 to 64, 22 aged 65 to 86, and 4 aged under 15. Findings: The differential incubation time histogram of the two age groups 15 to 64 and 65 to 86 are adequately fitted by the log normal model. For the 15 to 64 age group, the median incubation time of 7.00+1.10 - 0.9 days (uncertainties are 95 % CL) is broadly consistent with previous literature. For the 65-86 age group, the median is 10.9+2.7 - 2.0 days is statistically significantly longer. Moreover, for this group, the 95 % confidence contour indicates the data cannot constrain the upper bound of the log normal parameters , {sigma} by failing to close there; this is because the sample has a maximum incubation time of 17 days, beyond which we ran out of data even though the histogram has not yet peaked. Thus there is the potential of a much longer incubation time for the 65 to 86 age group than 10 to 14 days. Only a much larger sample can settle this.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ally Bi-zhu Jiang","author_inst":"Shenzhen RAK wireless Technology Co., Ltd., China"},{"author_name":"Richard Lieu","author_inst":"Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Alabama in Huntsville,  Huntsville, AL 35899, USA"},{"author_name":"Siobhan Quenby","author_inst":"Division of Reproductive Health, Warwick Medical School, The University of Warwick, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthew Scotch","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Chandini Raina MacIntyre","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Matthew H Bonds","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Abba B Gumel","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Wai-kit Ming","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Valentina Torboli","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Alberto Pallavicini","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Ruscio","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Giuliano Isontina (ASU GI), Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"ISBEM"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, SIMA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

Evaluating unexplained increases in deaths attributed to broad outcomes, such as pneumonia and influenza (P&I) or all causes, can provide a more complete and consistent picture of the burden caused by COVID-19. Methods We evaluated increases in the occurrence of deaths due to P&I above a seasonal baseline (adjusted for influenza activity) or due to any cause across the United States in February and March 2020. These estimates are compared with reported deaths due to COVID-19 and with testing data. Results There were notable increases in the rate of death due to P&I in February and March 2020. In a number of states, these deaths pre-dated increases in COVID-19 testing rates and were not counted in official records as related to COVID-19. There was substantial variability between states in the discrepancy between reported rates of death due to COVID-19 and the estimated burden of excess deaths due to P&I. The increase in all-cause deaths in New York and New Jersey is 1.5-3 times higher than the official tally of COVID-19 confirmed deaths or the estimated excess death due to P&I. Conclusions Excess P&I deaths provide a conservative estimate of COVID-19 burden and indicate that COVID-19-related deaths are missed in locations with inadequate testing or intense pandemic activity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Weinberger","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ted Cohen","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Forrest Crawford","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Farzad Mostashari","author_inst":"Aledade, Inc"},{"author_name":"Don Olson","author_inst":"Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York City, NY"},{"author_name":"Virginia E Pitzer","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts"},{"author_name":"Marcus Russi","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lone Simonsen","author_inst":"Department of Science and Environment, Roskilde University, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Annie Watkins","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"ISBEM"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, SIMA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

In the smartphone era a population can be immune to epidemics even if not a single one of its members is immune to the disease - a notion we propose to call \"digital herd immunity\", which is similarly an emergent characteristic of the population. This immunity arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune phase. As usage decreases there is a novel \"contact tracing\" phase transition to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the proportion of non-symptomatic transmission. We believe this is a promising strategy for dealing with COVID-19 in many countries such as India, whose challenges of scale motivated us to undertake this study.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vir Bannerjee Bulchandani","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Saumya Shivam","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Moudgalya","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"S L Sondhi","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Don Olson","author_inst":"Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York City, NY"},{"author_name":"Virginia E Pitzer","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts"},{"author_name":"Marcus Russi","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lone Simonsen","author_inst":"Department of Science and Environment, Roskilde University, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Annie Watkins","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"ISBEM"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, SIMA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

With only 536 COVID-19 cases and 11 fatalities, India - a democracy of 1.34 billion people - took the historic decision of a 21-day national lockdown on March 25. The lockdown was further extended to May 3, soon after the analysis of this paper was completed. Objective: To study the short- and long-term impact of an initial 21-day lockdown on the total number of COVID-19 cases in India compared to other less severe non-pharmaceutical interventions using epidemiological forecasting models and Bayesian estimation algorithms; to compare effects of hypothetical durations of lockdown from an epidemiological perspective; to study alternative explanations for slower growth rate of the virus outbreak in India, including exploring the association of the number of cases and average monthly temperature; and finally, to outline the pivotal role of reliable and transparent data, reproducible data science methods, tools and products as we reopen the country and prepare for a post lock-down phase of the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: We use the daily data on the number of COVID-19 cases, of recovered and of deaths from March 1 until April 7, 2020 from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Additionally, we use COVID-19 incidence counts data from Kaggle and the monthly average temperature of major cities across the world from Wikipedia. Main Outcome and Measures: The current time-series data on daily proportions of cases and removed (recovered and death combined) from India are analyzed using an extended version of the standard SIR (susceptible, infected, and removed) model. The eSIR model incorporates time-varying transmission rates that help us predict the effect of lockdown compared to other hypothetical interventions on the number of cases at future time points. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation of this model provided predicted proportions of the cases at future time points along with credible intervals (CI). Results: Our predicted cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in India on April 30 assuming a 1-week delay in people's adherence to a 21-day lockdown (March 25 - April 14) and a gradual, moderate resumption of daily activities after April 14 is 9,181 with upper 95% CI of 72,245. In comparison, the predicted cumulative number of cases under \"no intervention\" and \"social distancing and travel bans without lockdown\" are 358 thousand and 46 thousand (upper 95% CI of nearly 2.3 million and 0.3 million) respectively. An effective lockdown can prevent roughly 343 thousand (upper 95% CI 1.8 million) and 2.4 million (upper 95% CI 38.4 million) COVID-19 cases nationwide compared to social distancing alone by May 15 and June 15, respectively. When comparing a 21-day lockdown with a hypothetical lockdown of longer duration, we find that 28-, 42-, and 56-day lockdowns can approximately prevent 238 thousand (upper 95% CI 2.3 million), 622 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.3 million), 781 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.6 million) cases by June 15, respectively. We find some suggestive evidence that the COVID-19 incidence rates worldwide are negatively associated with temperature in a crude unadjusted analysis with Pearson correlation estimates [95% confidence interval] between average monthly temperature and total monthly incidence around the world being -0.185 [-0.548, 0.236] for January, -0.110 [-0.362, 0.157] for February, and -0.173 [-0.314, -0.026] for March. Conclusions and Relevance: The lockdown, if implemented correctly in the end, has a high chance of reducing the total number of COVID-19 cases in the short term, and buy India invaluable time to prepare its healthcare and disease monitoring system. Our analysis shows we need to have some measures of suppression in place after the lockdown for the best outcome. We cannot heavily rely on the hypothetical prevention governed by meteorological factors such as temperature based on current evidence. From an epidemiological perspective, a longer lockdown between 42-56 days is preferable. However, the lockdown comes at a tremendous price to social and economic health through a contagion process not dissimilar to that of the coronavirus itself. Data can play a defining role as we design post-lockdown testing, reopening and resource allocation strategies. Software: Our contribution to data science includes an interactive and dynamic app (covind19.org) with short- and long-term projections updated daily that can help inform policy and practice related to COVID-19 in India. Anyone can visualize the observed data for India and create predictions under hypothetical scenarios with quantification of uncertainties. We make our prediction codes freely available (https:\/\/github.com\/umich-cphds\/cov-ind-19) for reproducible science and for other COVID-19 affected countries to use them for their prediction and data visualization work.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Debashree Ray","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Salvatore","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Rupam Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Shariq Mohammed","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Soumik Purkayastha","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Aritra Halder","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Alexander Rix","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Daniel Barker","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Michael Kleinsasser","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yiwang Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Peter Song","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Debraj Bose","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Mousumi Banerjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Parikshit Ghosh","author_inst":"Delhi School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

Hence, reported rates of severe illness conditional on infection are higher than actual rates. Understanding the time path of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative. This paper explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative findings, using data from Illinois, New York, and Italy. We combine the data with assumptions on the infection rate in the untested population and on the accuracy of the tests that appear credible in the current context. We find that the infection rate might be substantially higher than reported. We also find that the infection fatality rate in Illinois, New York, and Italy is substantially lower than reported.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charles F.
