This disparity may reflect different airway levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and the spike protein activator, TMPRSS2. Here we explore the role of genetics and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency across world populations. Importantly, we find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by T2 inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and that interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. Finally, we define airway responses to coronavirus infections in children, finding that these infections upregulate IL6 while also stimulating a more pronounced cytotoxic immune response relative to other respiratory viruses. Our results reveal mechanisms likely influencing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Satria P Sajuthi","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Peter DeFord","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Jackson","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Michael T Montgomery","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Jamie L Everman","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Cydney L Rios","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Elmar Pruesse","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"James D Nolin","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth G Plender","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Michael E Wechsler","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"},{"author_name":"Angel CY Mak","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Celeste Eng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sandra Salazar","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Vivian Medina","author_inst":"Centro de Neumologia Pediatrica"},{"author_name":"Eric M Wohlford","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scott Huntsman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Soren Germer","author_inst":"New York Genome Center"},{"author_name":"Michael C Zody","author_inst":"New York Genome Center"},{"author_name":"Goncalo Abecasis","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Hyun Min Kang","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Kenneth M Rice","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Sam Oh","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jose Rodriguez-Santana","author_inst":"Centro de Neumologia Pediatrica"},{"author_name":"Esteban G Burchard","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Max A Seibold","author_inst":"National Jewish Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20054551","rel_title":"Safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, in light of rapid wide-spread use for COVID-19: a multinational, network cohort and self-controlled case series study","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20054551","rel_abs":"Background: Hydroxychloroquine has recently received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and is currently prescribed in combination with azithromycin for COVID-19 pneumonia. We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin. Methods: New user cohort studies were conducted including 16 severe adverse events (SAEs). Rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 18+ and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared to those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days. Self-controlled case series (SCCS) were conducted to further establish safety in wider populations. Separately, SAEs associated with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (compared to hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (CalHRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where I2<40%. Results: Overall, 956,374 and 310,350 users of hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine, and 323,122 and 351,956 users of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin were included. No excess risk of SAEs was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. SCCS confirmed these findings. However, when azithromycin was added to hydroxychloroquine, we observed an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (CalHR2.19 [1.22-3.94]), chest pain\/angina (CalHR 1.15 [95% CI 1.05-1.26]), and heart failure (CalHR 1.22 [95% CI 1.02-1.45]) Conclusions: Short-term hydroxychloroquine treatment is safe, but addition of azithromycin may induce heart failure and cardiovascular mortality, potentially due to synergistic effects on QT length. We call for caution if such combination is to be used in the management of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":78,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Rijnbeek","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jennifer C.E Lane","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Selva Muthu Kumaran Sathappan","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Singapore"},{"author_name":"James Weaver","author_inst":"Janssen Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Martijn Schuemie","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Kostka","author_inst":"Real World Solution, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sarah Seager","author_inst":"Real World Solution, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Fundaci\u00f3 Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Anthony Sena","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza F.

However, the current shortage in RNA extraction reagents as well as limitations in qPCR protocols have resulted in bottlenecks in testing capacity. Herein, we describe a novel molecular diagnostic for COVID-19 based on Sanger sequencing. This assay uses the addition of a frame-shifted spike-in, a modified PCR master mix, and custom Sanger sequencing data analysis to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a limit of detection comparable to existing qPCR-based assays, at 10-20 genome copy equivalents. Crucially, our assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from viral particles suspended in transport media that was directly added to the PCR master mix, suggesting that RNA extraction can be skipped entirely without any degradation of test performance. Since Sanger sequencing instruments are widespread in clinical laboratories and commonly have built-in liquid handling automation to support up to 3840 samples per instrument per day, the widespread adoption of qSanger COVID-19 diagnostics can unlock more than 1,000,000 tests per day in the US.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Devon Chandler-Brown","author_inst":"BillionToOne, Inc."},{"author_name":"Anna M.

As a matter of fact, a new SARS-type virus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible of a global pandemic in 2020 with unprecedented sanitary and economic consequences for most countries. In the present contribution we study, by all-atom equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, the interaction between the SARS Unique Domain and RNA guanine quadruplexes, a process involved in eluding the defensive response of the host thus favoring viral infection of human cells. Our results evidence two stable binding modes involving an interaction site spanning either the protein dimer interface or only one monomer. The free energy profile unequivocally points to the dimer mode as the thermodynamically favored one. The effect of these binding modes in stabilizing the protein dimer was also assessed, being related to its biological role in assisting SARS viruses to bypass the host protective response. This work also constitutes a first step of the possible rational design of efficient therapeutic agents aiming at perturbing the interaction between SARS Unique Domain and guanine quadruplexes, hence enhancing the host defenses against the virus.\n\nTOC GRAPHICS\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/029447v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (99K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1497e69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a4c44org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1511b7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13e12c1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cecilia Hognon","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Tom Miclot","author_inst":"Universita di Palermo"},{"author_name":"Cristina Garcia Iriepa","author_inst":"Universitad de Alcala"},{"author_name":"Antonio France-Monerris","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Grandemange","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Alessio Terenzi","author_inst":"Universita di Palermo"},{"author_name":"Marco Marazzi","author_inst":"Universidad de Alacala"},{"author_name":"Giampaolo Barone","author_inst":"Universita di Palermo"},{"author_name":"Antonio Monari","author_inst":"Universite de Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza F.

Vaccine and therapeutic discovery efforts are paramount to curb the pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S identified from memory B cells of a SARS survivor infected in 2003. One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-binding domain. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants. These results pave the way for using S309 and S309-containing antibody cocktails for prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dora Pinto","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Young-Jun Park","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Martina Beltramello","author_inst":"Humabs BioMed SA"},{"author_name":"Alexandra C.

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected over one million people worldwide as of April, 2020, and has led to the deaths of nearly 300,000 people. No approved vaccines or treatments in the USA currently exist for COVID-19, so there is an urgent need to develop effective countermeasures. The IMPDH inhibitor merimepodib (MMPD) is an investigational antiviral drug that acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH. It has been demonstrated to suppress replication of a variety of emerging RNA viruses. We report here that MMPD suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. After overnight pretreatment of Vero cells with 10 M of MMPD, viral titers were reduced by 4 logs of magnitude, while pretreatment for 4 hours resulted in a 3-log drop. The effect is dose-dependent, and concentrations as low as 3.3 M significantly reduced viral titers when the cells were pretreated prior to infection. The results of this study provide evidence that MMPD may be a viable treatment option for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalya Bukreyeva","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Emily K Mantlo","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Rachel A Sattler","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Cheng Huang","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Slobodan Paessler","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jerry Zeldis","author_inst":"ViralClear, a subsidiary of BioSig, Inc."},{"author_name":"Stefano Jaconi","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Katja Culap","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Fabrizia Zatta","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Anna De Marco","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Alessia Peter","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Barbara Guarino","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA"},{"author_name":"Roberto Spreafico","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cameroni","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rita E.

Although a few pets presented many clinical signs indicative for a coronavirus infection, no animal tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and no antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in their blood using an immunoprecipitation assay.

In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInhibition of the JAK1 kinase prevents pathology and mortality caused by a rampant innate immune response in mice.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kathryn Tuttle","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Ross Minter","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Katherine Waugh","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Paula Araya","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Michael Ludwig","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Colin Sempeck","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Keith Smith","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Zdenek Andrysik","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Matthew Burchill","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Beth Tamburini","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"David Orlicky","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Kelly D Sullivan","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Espinosa","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rita E.

So far, there is none vaccines or specific antiviral drugs approved for that. Therapeutic antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, was obtained from hyper immune equine plasma in this study. Herein, SARS-CoV-2 RBD with gram level were obtained through Chinese hamster ovary cells high-density fermentation. The binding of RBD to SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human ACE2, was verified and the efficacy of RBD in vivo was tested on mice and then on horses. As a result, RBD triggered high-titer neutralizing antibodies in vivo, and immunoglobulin fragment F(ab)2 was prepared from horse antisera through removing Fc. Neutralization test demonstrated that RBD-specific F(ab)2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 at 0.07 g\/ml, showing a potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2. These results highlights as RBD-specific F(ab)2 as therapeutic candidate for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Pan","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan YZY Biopharma Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tiejiong Fan","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Yan Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan YZY Biopharma Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Shi","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Weijuan Shang","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Fang","author_inst":"Wuhan YZY Biopharma Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiaming Jiang","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jian Shi","author_inst":"Wuhan YZY Biopharma Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yuan Sun","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Zhao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Ze Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rita E.

We have developed an integrative approach to predict repurposed drug candidates that can reverse SARS-CoV-2-induced gene expression in host cells, and evaluate their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. We found that 13 virus-induced gene expression signatures computed from various viral preclinical models could be reversed by compounds previously identified to be effective against SARS- or MERS-CoV, as well as drug candidates recently reported to be efficacious against SARS-CoV-2. Based on the ability of candidate drugs to reverse these 13 infection signatures, as well as other clinical criteria, we identified 10 novel candidates. The four drugs bortezomib, dactolisib, alvocidib, and methotrexate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells at < 1 {micro}M, but only methotrexate did not exhibit unfavorable cytotoxicity. Although further improvement of cytotoxicity prediction and bench testing is required, our computational approach has the potential to rapidly and rationally identify repurposed drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The analysis of signature genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 also revealed interesting time-dependent host response dynamics and critical pathways for therapeutic interventions (e.g. Rho GTPase activation and cytokine signaling suppression).","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Xing","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Rama Shankar","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Drelich","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Shreya Paithankar","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Eugene Chekalin","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dexheimer","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Sze Chua","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Surender Rajasekaran","author_inst":"Helen Devos Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te Kent Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Sun","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Zhao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Ze Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rita E.

Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4+ Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age-associated genes have functional effects on SARS-CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, age-associated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan D Chow","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Sidi Chen","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Drelich","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Shreya Paithankar","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Eugene Chekalin","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dexheimer","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Sze Chua","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Surender Rajasekaran","author_inst":"Helen Devos Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te Kent Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Sun","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Zhao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Ze Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rita E.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible behind this pandemic. The lethality of different viral strains is found to vary in different geographical locations but the molecular mechanism is yet to be known.\n\nMethodsAvailable data of whole genome sequencing of different viral strains published by different countries were retrieved and then analysed using Multiple Sequence Alignment and Pair-wise Sequence Alignment leading to Phylogenetic tree construction. Each location and the corresponding genetic variations were screened in depth. Then the variations are analysed at protein level giving special emphasis on Non Synonymous amino acid substitutions. The fatality rates in different countries were matched against the mutation number, rarity of the nucleotide alterations and functional impact of the Non Synonymous changes at protein level, separately and in combination.\n\nFindingsAll the viral strains have been found to evolve from the viral strain of Taiwan (MT192759) which is 100% identical with the ancestor SARS-CoV-2 sequences of Wuhan (NC 045512.2; submitted on 5th Jan, 2020). Transition from C to T (C>T) is the most frequent mutation in this viral genome and mutations A>T, G>A, T>A are the rarest ones, found in countries with maximum fatality rate i.e Italy, Spain and Sweden. 20 Non Synonymous mutations are located in viral genome spanning Orf1ab polyprotein, Surface glycoprotein, Nucleocapsid protein etc. The functional effect on the structure and function of the protein can favourably or unfavourably interact with the host body.\n\nInterpretationThe fatality outcome depends on three important factors (a) number of mutation (b) rarity of the allelic variation and (c) functional consequence of the mutation at protein level. The molecular divergence, evolved from the ancestral strain (S) lead to extremely lethal (E), lethal(L) and non lethal (N) strains with the involvement of an Intermediate strain(I).","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuvam Banerjee","author_inst":"Environmental Epigenomics lab, University of Calcutta"},{"author_name":"Shrinjana Dhar","author_inst":"Environmental Epigenomics lab, University of Calcutta"},{"author_name":"Sandip Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"Health-Management in Occupational Health, Siemens, Gurgaon, India"},{"author_name":"Pritha Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"Environmental Epigenomics lab, University of Calcutta"},{"author_name":"Eugene Chekalin","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dexheimer","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Sze Chua","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Surender Rajasekaran","author_inst":"Helen Devos Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te Kent Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Sun","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Zhao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Ze Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Serum Bio-technology Co., LTD."},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rita E.

Here, by employing single-cell analysis of the immune cell composition of severe-stage COVID-19 patients and these same patients in post Tocilizumab-treatment remission, we have identified a monocyte subpopulation specific to severe disease that contributes to inflammatory storms in COVID-19 patients. Although Tocilizumab treatment attenuated the strong inflammatory immune response, we found that immune cells including plasma B cells and CD8+ T cells still exhibited an intense humoral and cell-mediated anti-virus immune response in COVID-19 patients after Tocilizumab treatment. Thus, in addition to providing a rich, very high-resolution data resource about the immune cell distribution at multiple stages of the COVID-19 disease, our work both helps explain Tocilizumab\u2019s powerful therapeutic effects and defines a large number of potential new drug targets related to inflammatory storms.Competing Interest StatementJingwen Fang is the executive officer of HanGen

Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nTo determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples.\n\nWe demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa.\n\nCollectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer A Aguiar","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Jean-Marie Tremblay","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mansfield","author_inst":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Owen Woody","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Briallen Lobb","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Arinjay Banerjee","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Abiram Chandiramohan","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Tiessen","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Anna Dvorkin-Gheva","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Spencer Revill","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Matthew S Miller","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Christopher Carlsten","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Louise Organ","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Chitra Joseph","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Alison John","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Paul J Hanson","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Bruce M McManus","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Gisli Jenkins","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Karen Mossman","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Kjetil Ask","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Andrew C Doxey","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Jeremy A Hirota","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Jun Lin","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Aedin C.

However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. Here we investigated the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain transcriptome databases. According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some brain locations, such as the choroid plexus and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus. According to cell-type distribution analysis, nuclear expression of ACE2 was found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells) in human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. A few ACE2-expressing nuclei were found in a hippocampal dataset, and none were detected in the prefrontal cortex. Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2\/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brain, which indicates the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of inducing central nervous system symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Potential species differences should be considered when using mouse models to study the neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongrong Chen","author_inst":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Yu","author_inst":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Keer Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Derek Howard","author_inst":"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Leon French","author_inst":"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Zhong Chen","author_inst":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chengping Wen","author_inst":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghao Xu","author_inst":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Anna Dvorkin-Gheva","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Spencer Revill","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Matthew S Miller","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Christopher Carlsten","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Louise Organ","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Chitra Joseph","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Alison John","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Paul J Hanson","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Bruce M McManus","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Gisli Jenkins","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Karen Mossman","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Kjetil Ask","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Andrew C Doxey","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Jeremy A Hirota","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Jun Lin","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Aedin C.

We also analyze structures for glycoforms representing those present in the nascent glycoproteins (prior to enzymatic modifications in the Golgi), as well as those that are commonly observed on antigens present in other viruses.\n\nThese models were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine the extent to which glycan microheterogeneity impacts the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein. Lastly, we have identified peptides in the S glycoprotein that are likely to be presented in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes, and discuss the role of S protein glycosylation in potentially modulating the adaptive immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or to a related vaccine.\n\nThe 3D structures show that the protein surface is extensively shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the exception of the ACE2 receptor binding domain, and also that the degree of shielding is largely insensitive to the specific glycoform.

Although the use of ready-made reaction mixes can enable more rapid PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19, the need to transport and store these mixes at low temperatures presents challenges to already overburdened logistics networks. Here, we present an optimized freeze-drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration. We found that freeze-dried PCR mixes with [~]1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature (18[~]25{degrees}C) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37{degrees}C and 56{degrees}C, respectively. The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and hospital laboratories. This method can also be applied to the generation of freeze-dried PCR mixes for the detection of other pathogens.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiasu Xu","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Jin Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Zecheng Zhong","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Xiaosong Su","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Kunyu Yang","author_inst":"Xiamen International Travel Healthcare Center"},{"author_name":"Zhongfu Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Dongxu Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Tingdong Li","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Yingbin Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Shiyin Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen university"},{"author_name":"Chitra Joseph","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Alison John","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Paul J Hanson","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Bruce M McManus","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Gisli Jenkins","author_inst":"The University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Karen Mossman","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Kjetil Ask","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Andrew C Doxey","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Jeremy A Hirota","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Jun Lin","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Aedin C.

The replication of SARS-CoV-2 requires the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a direct target of the antiviral drug, Remdesivir. Here we report the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp either in the apo form or in complex with a 50-base template-primer RNA and Remdesivir at a resolution range of 2.5-2.8 [A]. The complex structure reveals that the partial double-stranded RNA template is inserted into the central channel of the RdRp where Remdesivir is incorporated into the first replicated base pair and terminates the chain elongation. Our structures provide critical insights into the working mechanism of viral RNA replication and a rational template for drug design to combat the viral infection.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wanchao Yin","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Chunyou Mao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Luan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Dan-Dan Shen","author_inst":"Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qingya Shen","author_inst":"Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haixia Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fulai Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Minqi Gao","author_inst":"Wuxi Biortus Biosciences Co.

SARS-CoV-2 genome was therefore computational searched for exact intra pairing within the viral RNA and also hybrid exact pairing with human transcriptome over a minimum 20 bases length. Minimal segments of 20 bases length of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found based on the theoretical matching with existing complementary strands in the human host transcriptome. Few human genes potentially annealing with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, among them mitochondrial deubiquitinase USP30, a subunit of ubiquitin protein ligase complex FBXO21 along with two long coding RNAs were retrieved. The hypothesis that viral originated RNAi might mediate degradation of messengers of the host transcriptome was corroborated by clinical observation and phylogenetic comparative analysis indicating a strong specificity of these hybrid pairing sequences for both SARS-CoV-2 and human genomes.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claude Pasquier","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"Alain Robichon","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Luan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Dan-Dan Shen","author_inst":"Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qingya Shen","author_inst":"Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haixia Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fulai Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Minqi Gao","author_inst":"Wuxi Biortus Biosciences Co.

Old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to alveolar damage, suggesting that lung senescence may increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Considering that human coronavirus (HCoVs; SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) require host cellular factors for infection and replication, we analyzed Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to test whether lung aging is associated with transcriptional changes in human protein-coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses. We found decreased expression of the gene tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) during aging in male individuals, and its protein was predicted to interact with HCoVs nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3 expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diogo de Moraes","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Brunno Vivone Buquete Paiva","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Sarah Santiloni Cury","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Joao Pessoa Araujo Jr.","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Alves da Silva Mori","author_inst":"State University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"},{"author_name":"Robson Francisco Carvalho","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fulai Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Minqi Gao","author_inst":"Wuxi Biortus Biosciences Co.

Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. We propose to identify mutational signatures of available SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. These signatures, Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. Through ISM compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and ORF1ab sites covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread.\n\nISMs are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. By analyzing sequence data available in the GISAID database, we validate the utility of ISM-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using ISMs to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In addition, we show the relationship of ISMs to phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and therefore, ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the Nextstrain [1] project. The developed pipeline dynamically generates ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on Github at https:\/\/github.com\/EESI\/ISM and via an interactive website at https:\/\/covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu\/.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, expanded to reportedly 8.7 million confirmed cases worldwide by June 21, 2020. The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the importance of tracking viral transmission dynamics in real-time. Through June 2020, researchers have obtained genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from over 47,000 samples from infected individuals worldwide. Since the virus readily mutates, each sequence of an infected individual contains useful information linked to the individuals exposure location and sample date. But, there are over 30,000 bases in the full SARS-CoV-2 genome--so tracking genetic variants on a whole-sequence basis becomes unwieldy. We describe a method to instead efficiently identify and label genetic variants, or \"subtypes\" of SARS-CoV-2. Applying this method results in a compact, 11 base-long compressed label, called an Informative Subtype Marker or \"ISM\". We define viral subtypes for each ISM, and show how regional distribution of subtypes track the progress of the pandemic. Major findings include (1) covarying nucleotides with the spike protein which has spread rapidly and (2) tracking emergence of a local subtype across the United States connected to Asia and distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is found to be connected to Europe.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhengqiao Zhao","author_inst":"Drexel University"},{"author_name":"Bahrad A.

A strategy for improved drug therapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2 by preferential damage to the viral proteome. Key reactive metabolites producing major quantitative damage to the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive glycating agent methylglyoxal (MG); cysteine residues and arginine residues are their most susceptible targets, respectively. From sequenced-based prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we found 0.8-fold enrichment or depletion of cysteine residues in functional domains of the viral proteome; whereas there was a 4.6-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to oxidative agents and sensitive to MG. For arginine residues of the SARS-CoV-2 predicted to be in functional domains, we examined which are activated towards modification by MG - residues with predicted or expected low pKa by neighbouring group in interactions. We found 25 such arginine residues, including 2 in the spike protein and 10 in the nucleoprotein. These sites were partially conserved in related coronaviridae: SARS-COV and MERS. Finally, we identified drugs which increase cellular MG concentration to virucidal levels: antitumor drugs with historical antiviral activity, doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Our findings provide evidence of potential vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to inactivation by MG and a scientific rationale for repurposing of doxorubicin and paclitaxel for treatment of COVID-19 disease, providing efficacy and adequate therapeutic index may be established.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maryam Al-Motawa","author_inst":"Hamad Bin Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Abbas","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wijten","author_inst":"Hamad Bin Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Alberto de la Fuente","author_inst":"Hamad Bin Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Mingzhan Xue","author_inst":"Hamad Bin Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Naila Rabbani","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Paul Thornalley","author_inst":"Hamad Bin Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Fulai Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Minqi Gao","author_inst":"Wuxi Biortus Biosciences Co.

The virus packaging efficiency of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 (S with C-terminal 18 amino acid truncation) is much higher than VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S. A neutralization assay for antibody screening and serum neutralizing titer quantification was established based on VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 pseudovirus and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) overexpressed BHK21 cell (BHK21-hACE2). The experimental results can be obtained by automatically counting EGFP positive cell number at 12 hours after infection, making the assay convenient and high-throughput. The serum neutralizing titer of COVID-19 convalescent patients measured by VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 pseudovirus assay has a good correlation with live SARS-CoV-2 assay. Seven neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2-S were obtained.

The confirmed cases probability density curve is high positive skewed and leptokurtic with mean global infected daily population of 6620. The recovered cases showed bimodal positive skewed curve of leptokurtic type with daily recovery of 1708. The change point detection helped to understand the CoVID-19 curve in term of sudden change in term of mean or mean with variance. This pointed out disease curve is consist of three phases and last segment that varies in term of day lengths. The mean with variance based change detection is better in differentiating phases and associated segment length as compared to mean. Global infected population might rise in the range of 0.750 to 4.680 million by 24th April 2020, depending upon the pandemic curve progress beyond 24th March, 2020. Expected most affected countries will be USA, Italy, China, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Iran and UK with at least infected population of over 0.100 million. Infected population polynomial projection errors remained in the range of -78.8 to 49.0%.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ibrar ul Hassan Akhtar","author_inst":"COMSATS University Islamabad"},{"author_name":"Yangtao Wu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jiali Cao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ren Yang","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Jian Ma","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Qiao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xiangyang Yao","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baohui Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yali Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wangheng Hou","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yang Shi","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Xu","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baorong Fu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Yang","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baoying Huang","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianying Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Aedin C.

In particular, the supply of N95 respirator masks has become severely depleted with supplies having to be rationed and health care workers having to use masks for prolonged periods in many countries. We sought to test the ability of 4 different decontamination methods including autoclave treatment, ethylene oxide gassing, ionized hydrogen peroxide fogging and vaporized hydrogen peroxide exposure to decontaminate 4 different N95 masks of experimental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 or vesicular stomatitis virus as a surrogate. In addition, we sought to determine whether masks would tolerate repeated cycles of decontamination while maintaining structural and functional integrity. We found that one cycle of treatment with all modalities was effective in decontamination and was associated with no structural or functional deterioration. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatment was tolerated to at least 5 cycles by masks. Most notably, standard autoclave treatment was associated with no loss of structural or functional integrity to a minimum of 10 cycles for the 3 pleated mask models. The molded N95 mask however tolerated only 1 cycle. This last finding may be of particular use to institutions globally due to the virtually universal accessibility of autoclaves in health care settings.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anand Kumar","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Samantha B.

This study assessed the predictors and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) among individuals with COVID-19. Methods: This observational study, included data on all patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 5 to March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was censored on March 8, 2020. This is a single-center, retrospective, observational study. Patients clinically confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 5 to March 8, 2020 were enrolled. We evaluated the association between changes in the incidence of AKI and COVID-19 disease and clinical outcomes by using logistic regression models. Results: A total of 287 patients, 55 with AKI and 232 without AKI, were included in the analysis. Compared to patients without AKI, AKI patients were older, predominantly male, and were more likely to present with hypoxia and have pre-existing hypertension and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, AKI patients had higher levels of white blood cells, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, a higher prevalence of hyperkalemia, lower lymphocyte counts, and higher chest computed tomographic scores. The incidence of stage 1 AKI was 14.3%, and the incidence of stage 2 or 3 AKI was 4.9%. Patients with AKI had substantially higher mortality. Conclusions: AKI is an important complication of COVID-19. Older age, male, multiple pre-existing comorbidities, lymphopenia, increased infection indicators, elevated D-dimer, and impaired heart and liver functions were the risk factors of AKI. AKI patients who progressed to stages 2 or 3 AKI had a higher mortality rate. Prevention of AKI and monitoring of kidney function is very important for COVID 19 patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guanhua Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Chronic Airways Diseases Laboratory, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Hu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Feng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tong Sha","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qiaobing Huang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Shock and Microcirculation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haijun Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Hankou Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Jiafa Han","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Hankou Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Wenhong Song","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Hankou Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Zhongqing Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhenhua Zeng","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital ofouthern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jay Krishnan","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg Canada"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Xu","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shaojuan Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baorong Fu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ting Yang","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Baoying Huang","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianying Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"Department of oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Molecular Medicine, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Di"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Aedin C.
