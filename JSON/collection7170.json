Due to possible extreme effects, such as hospitals potentially running out of beds or medical equipment, it is essential to lower the infection rate to create enough space to attend to the affected people and allow enough time for a vaccine to be developed. Unfortunately, this requires that measures put into place are upheld long enough to reduce the infection rate sufficiently. In this paper, we describe research simulating the influences of the contact rate on the spread of the pandemic using New York City as an example (Section IV) and especially already observed effects of contact rate increases during holidays [2-4] (Section V). In multiple simulations scenarios for Passover and Easter holidays, we evaluated 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% temporary increases in contact rates using a scenario close to the currently reported numbers as reference and contact rates based on bioterrorism research as a 'normal' baseline for NYC. The first general finding from the simulations is that singular events of increased visits\/contacts amplify each other disproportionately if they are happening in close proximity (time intervals) together. The second general observation was that contact rate spikes leave a permanently increased and devastating infection rate behind, even after the contact rate returns to the reduced one. In case of a temporary sustained increase of contact rate for just three days in a row, the aftermath results in an increase of infection rate up to 40%, which causes double the fatalities in the long run. In numbers, given that increases of 25% and 50% seem to be most likely given the data seen in Germany for the Easter weekend for example [2, 3], our simulations show the following increases (compared to the realistic reference run): for a temporary 25% surge in contact rate, the total cases grew by 215,880, the maximum of required hospitalizations over time increased to 63,063, and the total fatalities climbed by 8,844 accumulated over 90 days. As for the 50% surge, we saw the total number of cases rise by 461,090, the maximum number of required hospitalizations increase to 79,733, and the total number of fatalities climb by 19,125 over 90 days in NYC. All in all, we conclude that even very short, temporary increases in contact rates can have disproportionate effects and result in unrecoverable phenomena that can hardly be reversed or managed later. The numbers show possible phenomena before they might develop effects in reality. This is important because phenomena such as the described blip can impact the hospitals in reality. Therefore, we warn that a wave of infections due to increased contact rates during Passover\/Easter might come as a result!","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maximilian Vierlboeck","author_inst":"Stevens Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Roshanak R Nilchiani","author_inst":"Stevens Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Christine M Edwards","author_inst":"Stevens Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065318","rel_title":"State-level variation of initial COVID-19 dynamics in the United States: The role of local government interventions","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065318","rel_abs":"During an epidemic, metrics such as R0, doubling time, and case fatality rates are important in understanding and predicting the course of an epidemic. However, if collected over country or regional scales, these metrics hide important smaller-scale, local dynamics. We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We found that the case number, and trajectory of cases, differs considerably between states. We show that early non-pharmaceutical, government actions, were the most important determinant of epidemic dynamics. In particular, restricting restaurant operations was correlated with increased doubling times. Although individual states are clearly not independent, they can serve as small, natural experiments in how different demographic patterns and government responses can impact the course of an epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Easton R White","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Laurent R H\u00e9bert-Dufresne","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christine M Edwards","author_inst":"Stevens Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065342","rel_title":"Estimate of COVID-19 case prevalence in India based on surveillance data of patients with severe acute respiratory illness","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065342","rel_abs":"In absence of extensive testing for SARS-CoV-2, true prevalence of COVID-19 cases in India remain unknown.

While the risk of death from COVID-19 increases non-linearly in age, within-age-group variation in COVID-19 death rates across countries suggests that age structure alone cannot account for observed differences in COVID-19 mortality risk. Age-related conditions that render the elderly less resistant to health shocks are non-obviously positively related to the survival environment. More favorable survival environments promote longevity and the accumulation of health frailty among the elderly while less favorable survival environments induce a mortality selection process that results in a lower amount of accumulated health frailty. To explain observed differences in COVID- 19 mortality across the countries of Europe, we employ cross-national variation in pre-existing age-specific probabilities of death to identify heterogeneous survival environments and produce model-generated measures of accumulated health frailty. We find a strong positive relationship between our model-generated measures of accumulated health frailty and COVID-19 death rates (r = 0.772, p < .001) across the countries of Europe, a result that is robust to statistical control for the timing and strength of epidemic seeding from exported cases, the capacity of healthcare systems to manage and survive infected persons, as well as the timing and stringency of non- pharmaceutical interventions. Our results oblige the stylized facts that the risk of COVID-19 mortality is nonlinearly increasing in age and that a disproportionate share of deaths are occurring among frail populations in long-term care facilities.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Levi Altringer","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Sammy Zahran","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Ashok Prasad","author_inst":"Colorado State University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20065532","rel_title":"Estimation of Tunisia COVID-19 infected cases based on mortality rate","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20065532","rel_abs":"Estimating the number of people affected by COVID-19 is crucial in deciding which public health policies to follow. The authorities in different countries carry out mortality counts. We propose that the mortality reported in each country can be used to create an index of the number of actual cases at a given time. The specificity of whether or not deaths are rapid or not by COVID-19 also affects the number of actual cases. The number of days between the declaration of illness and death varies between 12 and 18 days. For a delay of 18 days, and using an estimated mortality rate of 2%, the number of cases in April 2020 in Tunisia would be 5 580 people. The pessimistic scenario predicts 22 320 infected people, and the most optimistic predicts 744 (which is the number of reported cases on April 12, 2020).

Most of SARS-CoV-2 carriers are assumed to exhibit no or mild non-specific symptoms. Thus, they may contribute to the rapid and mostly silent circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples it has recently been proposed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters (WW) as a complementary tool to investigate virus circulation in human populations. In the present work we assumed that the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should correlate with the number of symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw wastewater samples collected from several major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the Parisian area. The study was conducted from March 5 to April 23 2020, therefore including the lockdown period in France (since March 17 2020). We confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewaters accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genomes could be detected before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic. As importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genomes units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases which was an expected consequence of the lockdown. As a conclusion, this work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should bring important and additional information for an improved survey of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the local or regional scale.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastien Wurtzer","author_inst":"Eau de Paris"},{"author_name":"Vincent Marechal","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Mouchel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, CNRS, EPHE, UMR 7619 Metis, 75005 PARIS, e-LTER Zone Atelier Seine, France"},{"author_name":"Yvon Maday","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, CNRS, Universite de Paris, Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions (LJLL), F-75005 Paris, France et Institut Universitaire de France"},{"author_name":"Remy Teyssou","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Institut de Recherche Biomedicale des Armees. 1 Place du General Valerie Andre.

It is found that the growth of the number of infected individuals $N(t)$ can be modeled across different states with a simple linear function $N(t)=\\gamma+\\alpha t$ beyond the date when reasonable number of individuals were tested (and when a countrywide lockdown was imposed). The slope $\\alpha$ is different for different states. Following recent work by Notari (arxiv:2003.12417), we then consider the dependency of the $\\alpha$ for different states on the average maximum and minimum temperatures, the average relative humidity and the population density in each state. It turns out that like other countries, the parameter $\\alpha$, which determines the rate of rise of the number of infected individuals, seems to have a weak correlation with the average maximum temperature of the state. In contrast, any significant variation of $\\alpha$ with humidity or minimum temperature seems absent with almost no meaningful correlation. Expectedly, $\\alpha$ increases (slightly) with increase in the population density of the states; however, the degree of correlation here too is negligible. These results seem to barely suggest that a natural cause like a hot summer (larger maximum temperatures) may contribute towards reducing the transmission of the virus, though the role of minimum temperature, humidity and population density remains somewhat obscure from the inferences which may be drawn from presently available data.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anushree Roy","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Sayan Kar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.

There is a pressing need to find an effective therapy. METHODS We have assembled a cohort consisting 504 hospitalized COVID-19. Information of patients characteristics and antiviral medication use during hospital stay is collected. The study objective is to evaluate the treatment efficacy of selected antiviral medications on mortality and lesion absorption based on chest CT scan. RESULTS The overall mortality rate was 15.67% in the cohort. Older age, lower SpO2 level, bigger lesion, early admission data, and the presence of pre-existing conditions were associated with higher mortality. After adjusting for sex, pre-existing condition, age, SpO2, lesion size, admission data, hospital, and anti-viral medications use, Arbidol and Oseltamivir use is associated with a reduction in mortality. The OR is 0.183 (95% CI, 0.075 to 0.446; p<0.001) for Arbidol and 0.220 (95% CI, 0.069 to 0.707; p=0.011) for Oseltamivir. Compared with patients taking neither Arbidol nor Oseltamivir, the OR is 0.253 (95% CI, 0.064 to 1.001; p=0.050) for patients taking Oseltamivir only; 0.190 (95% CI, 0.076 to 0.473; p<0.001) for patients taking Arbidol only; and 0.030 (95% CI, 0.003 to 0.310; p=0.003) for patients taking both, after adjusting for patients characteristics and Lopinavir\/Ritonavir use. Similarly, Arbidol is also associated with faster lesion absorption after adjusting for patients characteristics as well as Oseltamivir and Lopinavir\/Ritonavir use.

The progression and geographical distribution of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland between the 17th of March and the 18th of May to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression. Aim. To determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Methods. A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between the 17th of March and 19th of May, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Results. All samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 6\/500 donors from the 23th-26th of March. The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after the 5th-6th April until the end of the study on the 18th of May. We find that infections are concentrated in certain postcodes indicating that outbreaks of infection are extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remain comparatively untouched by the epidemic. Conclusion. These data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Craig P Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Grayson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert Paton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jai S Bolton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Louren\u00e7o","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bridget Penman","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Lian Ni Lee","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Valerie Odon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Senthil Chinnakannan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wanwisa Dejnirattisai","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew Edmans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20060566","rel_title":"Delayed clearance of SARS-CoV2 in male compared to female patients: High ACE2 expression in testes suggests possible existence of gender-specific viral reservoirs","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20060566","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 has been observed to cause a higher incidence and greater severity of disease in males, as seen in multiple cohorts across the globe. The reasons for gender disparity in disease severity is unclear and can be due to host factors. To determine whether males have delayed viral clearance after infection, we evaluated the time to clearance in symptomatic patients tested by serial oropharyngeal\/nasopharyngeal swabs followed by RT-PCR at a reference lab in Mumbai, India. A total of 68 subjects with median age of 37 years (3-75 range) were examined and included 48 (71%) males and 20 (29%) females. We observed that females were able to achieve viral clearance significantly earlier than males, with a median difference of 2 days in achieving a negative PCR result (P value = 0.038). Furthermore, examination of 3 families with both male and female patients followed serially, demonstrated that female members of the same household cleared the SARS-CoV2 infection earlier in each family. To determine reasons for delayed clearance in males, we examined the expression patterns of the SARS-CoV2 receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in tissue specific repositories. We observed that the testes was one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases (Human Protein Atlas, FAMTOM5 and GETx). ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels. Interestingly, very little expression of ACE2 was seen in ovarian tissue. Taken together, these observations demonstrate for the first time that male subjects have delayed viral clearance of SARS-CoV2. High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males and should be further investigated.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditi Shastri","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Justin Wheat","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Sachee Agrawal","author_inst":"Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Hospital, Kasturba Hospital for Infections Diseases, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Nirjhar Chaterjee","author_inst":"Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Hospital Kasturba Hospital for Infections Diseases, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Kith Pradhan","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Mendel Goldfinger","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Noah Kornblum","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Steidl","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Amit Verma","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Jayanthi Shastri","author_inst":"Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Hospital, Kasturba Hospital for Infections Diseases, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Wanwisa Dejnirattisai","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew Edmans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20060491","rel_title":"Monitoring and predicting viral dynamics in SARS-CoV-2-infected Patients","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20060491","rel_abs":"This manuscript is based on the a simple but robust model we developed urgently to accurately monitor and predict viral dynamics for each SARS-CoV-2-infected patient, given the limited number of RT-PCR tests and the complexity of each individual's physical health situation.

Methods: A retrospective review of all COVID-19 infected patients treated at Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 1 to Mar 20 was carried out. Continuous variables were described as mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR), while categorical variables were compared by X2 test or Fisher's exact test between COVID-19 infected patients with mycoplasma lgG (-) and mycoplasma lgG (+). Results: Statistically significant differences were shown in terms of laboratory test results. COVID-19 infected patients with mycoplasma lgG positivity had a higher lymphocyte count and percentage (p=0.026, p=0.017), monocyte count and percentage (p=0.028, p=0.006) and eosinophil count and percentage (p=0.039, p=0.007), and a lower neutrophil count and percentage (p=0.044, p=0.006) than COVID-19 infected patients without mycoplasma lgG. Other routine blood tests, including coagulation tests, blood biochemistry and infection-related biomarkers did not significantly differ except for thrombin time (p=0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.008). Furthermore, requirement and use of a nasal catheter or oxygen mask was significantly lower in COVID-19 infected patients with mycoplasma lgG positivity (p=0.029). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that mycoplasma IgG positivity is a potential protective factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bobin Mi","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lang Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Adriana C.

Due to presumptions of poor outcomes in such critically ill patients, many hospitals have started considering a universal do-not-resuscitate order in patients with confirmed Covid-19 given a limited supply of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and the potential risk of transmission of infection to healthcare workers during resuscitation. However, empirical data on survival of cardiac arrest in Covid-19 patients are unavailable at this time. To inform this debate, we report survival outcomes following cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a cohort of similar critically ill patients with pneumonia or sepsis who were receiving mechanical ventilation in an ICU at the time of arrest. The probability of survival without severe neurological disability (CPC of 1 or 2) ranged from less than 3% to over 22% across key patient subgroups, For patients with an initial rhythm of asystole or PEA, who were also receiving vasopressors at the time of arrest, fewer than 10% were discharged without severe neurological disability (CPC of 1 or 2), and this number dropped to less than 3% in patients over 80 years old. In contrast, survival rates were much higher in younger patients, patients with an initial rhythm of VF or pulseless VT, and in patients receiving ventilatory support without vasopressors. Our findings suggest caution in universal resuscitation policies. Even in a cohort of critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation, survival outcomes following in-hospital resuscitation were not uniformly poor and varied markedly depending on age, co-morbidities and illness severity. We believe that these data can help inform discussions among patients, providers and hospital leaders regarding resuscitation policies and goals of care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saket Girotra","author_inst":"University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Tang","author_inst":"St. Luke's Mid America Heart Institute"},{"author_name":"Paul Chan","author_inst":"University of Missouri - Kansas City and St. Luke's Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO"},{"author_name":"Brahmajee K Nallamothu","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"},{"author_name":"Antonio Tufaro","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Palma","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Angela Maria Vittoria Larocca","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Maria Chironna","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo D'Addabbo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Donata Raffaele","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Cafagna","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061366","rel_title":"A Fractal kinetics SI model can explain the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061366","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has already had a shocking impact on the lives of everybody on the planet.

The analysis demonstrated a strong correlation (R2>0.7) between increment in air pollution and an increase in the risk of COVID-19 transmission within London boroughs. Particularly, strong correlations (R2>0.72) between the risk of COVID-19 fatality and NO2 and PM2.5 pollution concentrations were also found. Although this study assumed the same level of air pollution across a particular London borough, it demonstrates the possibility to employ air pollution as an indicator to rapidly identify the vulnerable regions within a city. Such an approach can inform the decisions to suspend or reduce the operation of different public transport modes within a city. The methodology and learnings from the study can thus aid public transport to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak by adopting different levels of human-mobility reduction strategies based on the vulnerability of a given region.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manu Sasidharan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ajit Singh","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Mehran Eskandari Torbaghan","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ajith Kumar Parlikad","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Antonio Tufaro","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Palma","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Angela Maria Vittoria Larocca","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Maria Chironna","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo D'Addabbo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Donata Raffaele","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Cafagna","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061143","rel_title":"Lockdowns to Contain COVID-19 Increase Risk and Severity of Mosquito-Borne Disease Outbreaks","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061143","rel_abs":"Many countries are implementing lockdown measures to slow the COVID-19 pandemic, putting more than a third of the world's population under restrictions. The scale of such lockdowns is unprecedented, and while some effects of lockdowns are readily apparent, it is less clear what effects they may have on outbreaks of serious communicable diseases. We examine the impact of these lockdowns on outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. Using an agent-based model and simulations, we find that the risk and severity of such outbreaks is much greater under lockdown conditions, with the number of infected people doubling in some cases. This increase in number of cases varies by different mosquito-borne diseases, and is significantly higher for diseases spread by day-biting mosquitoes. We analysed various intervention strategies and found that during lockdowns, decentralised strategies such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying are more effective than centralised strategies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshay Jindal","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Shrisha Rao","author_inst":"International Institute of Information Technology - Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Mehran Eskandari Torbaghan","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ajith Kumar Parlikad","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Antonio Tufaro","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Palma","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Angela Maria Vittoria Larocca","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Maria Chironna","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo D'Addabbo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Donata Raffaele","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Cafagna","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20060228","rel_title":"Basic reproduction number of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease in Major Endemic Areas of China: A latent profile analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20060228","rel_abs":"Objective: The aim of the study is to analyze the latent class of basic reproduction number (R0) trend of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in major endemic areas of China. Methods The provinces that reported more than 500 cases of COVID-19 till February 18, 2020 were selected as the major endemic area. The Verhulst model was used to fit the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases. The R0 of COVID-19 was calculated using the parameters of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19, respectively. The latent class of R0 was analyzed using a latent profile analysis model. Results The median R0 calculated from SARS and COVID-19 parameters were 1.84 - 3.18 and 1.74 - 2.91, respectively. The R0 calculated from the SARS parameters was greater than that of calculated from the COVID-19 parameters (Z = -4.782 - -4.623, P < 0.01). Both R0 can be divided into three latent classes. The initial value of R0 in class 1 (Shandong Province, Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality) was relatively low and decreases slowly. The initial value of R0 in class 2 (Anhui Province, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, Henan Province, Zhejiang Province, Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province) was relatively high and decreases rapidly. Moreover, the initial value of R0 of class 3 (Hubei Province) was between that of class 1 and class 2, but the higher level of R0 lasts longer and decreases slowly. Conclusion The results indicated that overall trend of R0 has been falling with the strengthening of China's comprehensive prevention and control measures for COVID-19, however, presents regional differences.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Honglv Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Min Yuan","author_inst":"School of Health Service Management, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liya Ma","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Meng Liu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwen Liu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Gan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fangbiao Tao","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo D'Addabbo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Donata Raffaele","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Cafagna","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20059253","rel_title":"Age could be driving variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20059253","rel_abs":"Background Current geographic spread of documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections shows heterogeneity. This study explores the role of age in potentially driving differentials in infection spread, epidemic potential, and rates of disease severity and mortality across countries. Methods An age-stratified deterministic mathematical model that describes SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics was applied to 159 countries and territories with a population [&ge;]1 million. Results Assuming worst-case scenario for the pandemic, the results indicate that there could be stark regional differences in epidemic trajectories driven by differences in the distribution of the population by age. In the African Region (median age: 18.9 years), the median R0 was 1.05 versus 2.05 in the European Region (median age: 41.7 years), and the median (per 100 persons) for the infections rate was 22.5 (versus 69.0), for severe and\/or critical disease cases rate was 3.3 (versus 13.0), and for death rate was 0.5 (versus 3.9). Conclusions Age could be a driver of variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide. Countries with sizable adult and\/or elderly populations and smaller children populations may experience large and rapid epidemics in absence of interventions. Meanwhile, countries with predominantly younger age cohorts may experience smaller and slower epidemics. These predictions, however, should not lead to complacency, as the pandemic could still have a heavy toll nearly everywhere.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Houssein H.

However, it is impaired by high costs, logistic issues and high risk of exposure. Chest x-ray (CXR) is a low-cost, low-risk, not time consuming technique and is emerging as the recommended imaging modality to use in COVID-19 pandemic. This technique, although less sensitive than CT-scan, can provide useful information about pulmonary involvement. Purpose To describe chest x-ray features of COVID-19 pneumonia and to evaluate the sensitivity of this technique in detecting pneumonia. A further scope is to assess the effectiveness of a post-processing algorithm in improving lung lesions detectability. Materials and Methods 72 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 underwent bedside chest X-ray. Two radiologists were asked to express their opinion about: (i) presence of pneumonia (negative or positive); (ii) localization (unilateral or bilateral); (iii) topography (according to pulmonary fields); (iv) density (non consolidative ground-glass or inhomogeneous opacities; consolidative nodulartype or triangular; mixed consolidative e non-consolidative); and (v) presence of pleural effusion. The point (i) was evaluated separately, while the other points in consensus. A quality assessment of post-processed x-ray images was performed by two different readers. Results The agreement about presence of pneumonia was almost perfect with K value of 0.933 and p < 0.001. Sensitivity was 69%. The following findings were seen: unilateral lung involvement in 50%; lower lung lesions in 54%; peripheral distribution in 48%; and non-consolidative pattern in 44%. Post-processed images improved the detection of lesions in 7 out 72 patients ({cong}10%) Conclusion CXR owns a good sensitivity in detecting COVID-19 lung involvement. Use of post-processing algorithm can improve detection of lesions. Our data support recommendations of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) to consider chest x-ray as first step imaging examination in Covid-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michele Gaeta","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Cicero","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Maria Adele Marino","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Tommaso D'Angelo","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Enrico Maria Mormina","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Silvio Mazziotti","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Blandino","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Giulio Siracusano","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Aurelio La Corte","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Massimo Chiappini","author_inst":"Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Finocchio","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20062695","rel_title":"Shut it down: a cross country panel analysis on the efficacy of lockdown measures","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20062695","rel_abs":"Coronavirus pandemic outbreak from China in the December 2019 and since then has quickly spread all over the world.

To assess the impact of isolation measures on deaths, hospitalizations, and economic output, we create a mathematical model to simulate the spread of COVID-19, incorporating effects of restrictive measures and segmenting the population based on health risk and economic vulnerability. Policymakers make isolation policy decisions based on current levels of disease spread and economic damage. For 76 weeks in a population of 330 million, we simulate a baseline scenario leaving strong isolation restrictions in place, rapidly reducing isolation restrictions for non-seniors shortly after outbreak containment, and gradually relaxing isolation restrictions for non-seniors. We used 76 weeks as an approximation of the time at which a vaccine will be available. In the baseline scenario, there are 235,724 deaths and the economy shrinks by 34.0%. With a rapid relaxation, a second outbreak takes place, with 525,558 deaths, and the economy shrinks by 32.3%. With a gradual relaxation, there are 262,917 deaths, and the economy shrinks by 29.8%. We also show that hospitalizations, deaths, and economic output are quite sensitive to disease spread by asymptomatic people. Strict restrictions on seniors with very gradual lifting of isolation for non-seniors results in a limited number of deaths and lesser economic damage. Therefore, we recommend this strategy and measures that reduce non-isolated disease spread to control the pandemic while making isolation economically viable.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Uri Goldsztejn","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"David Schwartzman","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis."},{"author_name":"Arye Nehorai","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Tommaso D'Angelo","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Enrico Maria Mormina","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Silvio Mazziotti","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Blandino","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Giulio Siracusano","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Aurelio La Corte","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Massimo Chiappini","author_inst":"Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Finocchio","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061804","rel_title":"Ivermectin as a potential COVID-19 treatment from the pharmacokinetic point of view","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061804","rel_abs":"The broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent ivermectin has been very recently found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and proposed as a candidate for drug repurposing in COVID-19.

As a measure of transmissibility, we aimed to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number over time during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Methods: We extracted the epidemic data from the \"Tracking the Epidemic\" website of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the duration of January 19, 2020 and March 14, 2020. Then, we specified two plausible distributions of serial interval to apply the novel estimation method implemented in the incidence and EpiEstim packages to the data of daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating the time-varying reproduction number in the R software. Results: The epidemic curve of daily new confirmed cases in China peaked around February 4-6, 2020, and then declined gradually, except the very high peak on February 12, 2020 owing to the added clinically diagnosed cases of the Hubei Province. Under two specified plausible scenarios for the distribution of serial interval, both curves of the estimated time-varying reproduction numbers fell below 1.0 around February 17-18, 2020. Finally, the COVID-19 epidemic in China abated around March 7-8, 2020, indicating that the prompt and aggressive control measures of China were effective. Conclusion: Seeing the estimated time-varying reproduction number going downhill speedily was more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease. We urged public health authorities and scientists to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers routinely during an epidemic of infectious diseases and to report them daily to the public until the end of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fu-Chang Hu","author_inst":"International-Harvard Statistical Consulting Company"},{"author_name":"Fang-Yu Wen","author_inst":"International-Harvard Statistical Consulting Company"},{"author_name":"Arye Nehorai","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Tommaso D'Angelo","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Enrico Maria Mormina","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Silvio Mazziotti","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Blandino","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Giulio Siracusano","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Aurelio La Corte","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Massimo Chiappini","author_inst":"Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Finocchio","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20062109","rel_title":"Lopinavir\/ritonavir for the treatment of COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20062109","rel_abs":"Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of lopinavir\/ritonavir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Design This is the protocol of a living systematic review. Data sources We will conduct searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of lopinavir\/ritonavir - as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs - versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating lopinavir\/ritonavir in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francisca Verdugo-Paiva","author_inst":"Fundacion Epistemonikos"},{"author_name":"Ariel Izcovich","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Service, German Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Martin Ragusa","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Service, German Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Rada","author_inst":"Fundacion Epistemonikos"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 L-OVE Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Silvio Mazziotti","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Blandino","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Giulio Siracusano","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Aurelio La Corte","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Massimo Chiappini","author_inst":"Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Finocchio","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061473","rel_title":"An experimental trial of recombinant human interferon alpha nasal drops to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 in medical staff in an epidemic area","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061473","rel_abs":"Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interferon alpha (rhIFN-) nasal drops in healthy medical staff to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods A prospective, open-label study was conducted in January 21, 2020at Taihe Hospital in Shiyan City, Hubei Province. Totally, 2944 medical staff members were recruited and allocated into low-risk group or high-risk group according to whether they were directly exposed to COVID-19 patients. Participants in the low-risk group received rhIFN- nasal drops (2-3 drops\/nostril\/time, 4 times\/day) for 28 days with first-level protection; those in the high-risk group received identical rhIFN- nasal drops combined with thymosin-1 (1.6 mg, hypodermic injection, once a week) along with secondary-level or third-level protection. The primary outcome was new-onset COVID-19 over 28 days. The secondary outcome was new-onset fever or respiratory symptoms but with negative pulmonary images. The results were compared with new-onset COVID-19 in medical staff in Hubei Province (including Wuhan) during the same period. Adverse reactions to interferon nasal drops were also observed. Results Among the 2944 subjects in our study, 2415 were included in the low-risk group, including 997 doctors and 1418 nurses with average ages of 37.38 and 33.56 years, respectively; 529 were included in the high-risk group, including 122 doctors and 407 nurses with average ages of 35.24 and 32.16 years, respectively. The 28-day incidence of COVID-19 was zero in both the high and low-risk groups. The 28-day incidence of new-onset clinical symptoms with negative images for pneumonia was also zero in both the high and low-risk groups. As control, a total of 2035 medical personnel with confirmed COVID-19 from the same area (Hubei Province) was observed between January 21 to February 23, 2020. No serious adverse events were observed in our trial during the intervention period. Conclusion In this investigator-initiated open-label study, we observed that rhIFN- nasal drops may effectively prevent COVID-19 in medical staff, as an enhancement protection on the basis of standard physical isolation. Our results also indicate that rhIFN- nasal drops have potential promise for protecting susceptible healthy people during the coronavirus pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhongji Meng","author_inst":"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Team, Taihe Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine.
