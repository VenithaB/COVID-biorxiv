We collated the data provided by the Nepalese Ministry of Health and Population and assessed scenario of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal during the lockdown period. There were only two confirmed cases from 610 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and no fatalities when the government introduced nationwide lockdown. Nepal had performed 7,791 RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown. It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from the total of 4,483 RT-PCR tests performed on a single day. Nepal had reported total 17,994 positive cases and 40 deaths at the end of lockdown. The spatial distribution clearly shows that the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most points of entry and exit from India are located. The Government of Nepal needs to allocate more resources, increase its capacity to test and trace, establish dedicated isolation and quarantine facility and impose local restrictions to manage potential COVID-19 outbreak after easing lockdown.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kusum Sharma Parajuli","author_inst":"Science Hub"},{"author_name":"Amrit Banstola","author_inst":"Public Health Perspective Nepal"},{"author_name":"Rishi Ram Parajuli","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.04.20187922","rel_title":"Viable virus aerosol propagation by PAP circuit leak and mitigation with a ventilated patient hood: a model for improving health care worker safety in the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-09-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20187922","rel_abs":"Background: Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging evidence suggests patients auto-emit aerosols containing viable respiratory viruses. These aerosols could be further propagated when patients undergo certain treatments including continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. This study aimed to assess the degree of viable virus propagated from mask leak in a PAP circuit and the mitigation of virus propagation by an air filter combined with a plastic canopy. Methods: Bacteriophage PhiX174 (108copies\/mL) was nebulised into a custom PAP circuit within a non-vented clinical room. Mask leak was systematically varied to allow 0, 7, 21, 28 and 42 L\/min at the mask interface. Plates containing Escherichia coli host assessed the degree of viable virus (via plaque forming unit) settling on surfaces around the room. In order to contain virus spread, the efficacy of a simple, low-cost ventilated headboard, created from a plastic tarpaulin hood and a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was tested. Findings: Increasing mask leak was associated with virus contamination in a dose response manner (chisquared=58.24, df=4, p<0.001). Clinically relevant levels of leak (>21 L\/min) were associated with virus counts equivalent to using PAP with a standard vented mask. The highest frequency of viruses was detected on surfaces 1m from the leak source, however, viable viruses were recorded on all plates (up to 3.86m from source). A plastic hood with HEPA filtration significantly reduced viable viruses on all plates. HEPA exchange rates of 170 and 470m3\/hr eradicated all evidence of virus contamination. Interpretation: Mask leak from PAP circuits may be a major source of environmental contamination and nosocomial spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Subclinical levels of leak should be treated as an infectious risk. Cheap and low-cost patient hoods with HEPA filtration are an effective countermeasure.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shane A Landry","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Monash University"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Barr","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Martin MacDonald","author_inst":"Monash Lung and Sleep"},{"author_name":"Dinesh Subedi","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Darren Mansfield","author_inst":"Monash Lung and Sleep"},{"author_name":"Garun Hamilton","author_inst":"Monash Lung and Sleep"},{"author_name":"Bradley Edwards","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Simon Joosten","author_inst":"Monash Lung and Sleep"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.03.20187732","rel_title":"Swab pooling for large-scale RT-qPCR screening of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-09-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.03.20187732","rel_abs":"Pool testing has been proposed as an alternative for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, dilution factors proportional to the number of pooled samples have been a source of major concern regarding its diagnostic performance. Further, sample pooling can lead to increased laboratory workload and operational complexity. Therefore, pooling strategies that minimize sample dilution, loss of sensitivity, and laboratory overload are needed to allow reliable and large-scale screenings of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe a pooling procedure in which nasopharyngeal swabs are pooled together at the time of sample collection (swab pooling), decreasing laboratory manipulation and minimizing dilution of the viral RNA present in the samples. Paired analysis of pooled and individual samples from 613 patients revealed 94 positive individual tests. Having individual testing as a reference, no false-positives or false-negatives were observed for swab pooling. A Bayesian model estimated a sensitivity of 99% (Cr.I. 96.9% to 100%) and a specificity of 99.8% (Cr.I. 99.4% to 100%) for the swab pooling procedure. Data from additional 18,922 patients screened with swab pooling were included for further quantitative analysis. Mean Cq differences between individual and corresponding pool samples ranged from 0.1 Cq (Cr.I. -0.98 to 1.17) to 2.09 Cq (Cr.I. 1.24 to 2.94). Overall, 19,535 asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients were screened using 4,400 RT-qPCR assays, resulting in 246 positive patients (positivity rate 1.26%). This corresponds to an increase of 4.4 times in laboratory capacity and a reduction of 77% in required tests. Finally, these data demonstrate that swab pooling can significantly minimize sample dilution and sensitivity issues commonly seen in its traditional counterpart. Therefore, swab pooling represents a major alternative for reliable and large-scale screening of SARS-CoV-2 in low prevalence populations.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Paula Christoff","author_inst":"BiomeHub"},{"author_name":"Giuliano Netto Flores Cruz","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Aline Fernanda Rodrigues Sereia","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Dellyana Rodrigues Boberg","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Daniela Carolina de Bastiani","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Lais Eiko Yamanaka","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Gislaine Fongaro","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Patricia Hermes Stoco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Maria Luiza Bazzo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Edmundo Carlos Grisard","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Camila Hernandes","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Luiz Felipe Valter de Oliveira","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.03.20187856","rel_title":"Immunological characteristics govern the changing severity of COVID-19 during the transition to endemicity","rel_date":"2020-09-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.03.20187856","rel_abs":"As prospects for eradicating CoV-2 dwindle, we are faced with the question of how the severity of CoV-2 disease may change in the years ahead. Will CoV-2 continue to be a pathogenic scourge that, like smallpox or measles, can be tamed only by ongoing vaccination, or will it join the ranks of mild endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs)? Our analysis of immunological and epidemiological data on HCoVs shows that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly, but disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. We estimate the relevant parameters and incorporate them into a new epidemiological model framework which separates these different components of immunity. Our model recapitulates both the current severity of CoV-2 and the relatively benign nature of HCoVs; suggesting that once the endemic phase is reached, CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. The benign outcome at the endemic phase is contingent on the virus causing primary infections in children. We predict a very different outcome were a CoV like MERS (that causes severe disease in children) to become endemic. These results force us to re-evaluate control measures that rely on identifying and isolating symptomatic infections, and reconsider ideas regarding herd immunity and the use of immune individuals as shields to protect vulnerable groups.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennie S Lavine","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ottar  N Bjornstad","author_inst":"Penn State University"},{"author_name":"Rustom Antia","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Dellyana Rodrigues Boberg","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Daniela Carolina de Bastiani","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Lais Eiko Yamanaka","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Gislaine Fongaro","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Patricia Hermes Stoco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Maria Luiza Bazzo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Edmundo Carlos Grisard","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Camila Hernandes","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Luiz Felipe Valter de Oliveira","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.05.284224","rel_title":"Vapur: A Search Engine to Find Related Protein - Compound Pairs in COVID-19 Literature","rel_date":"2020-09-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.05.284224","rel_abs":"Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) created dire consequences globally and triggered an enormous scientific effort from different domains.

To control the COVID-19 pandemic it is crucial to understand the true seroprevalence, but not every region has access to extensive centralized PCR and serology testing. Currently available rapid antibody tests lack the accuracy needed for recommendation by health authorities. To fill this gap, we analyzed and validated the clinical performance of a new point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Assay, a chromatographic immunoassay for qualitative detection of IgM\/IgG antibodies for use in near-patient settings. Analysis was performed using 42 Anti-SARS-Cov-2 positive (CoV+) and 92 Anti-SARS-Covid-2 negative (CoV-) leftover samples from before December 2019, using the Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 as the reference assay. Analytical specificity was tested using leftover samples from individuals with symptoms of common cold collected before December 2019. The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test was 100.0% (95% CI 91.59-100.00) sensitive and 96.74% (95% CI 90.77-99.32) specific with an assay failure rate of 0.00%. No cross-reactivity was observed against the common cold panel. Method comparison was additionally conducted by two external laboratories, using 100 CoV+\/275 CoV- samples, also comparing whole blood versus plasma matrix. The comparison demonstrated for plasma 96.00% positive\/96.36% negative percent agreement with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and overall 99.20% percent agreement between whole blood and EDTA plasma. The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test demonstrated similar clinical performance to the manufacturer's data and to a centralized automated immunoassay, with no cross-reactivity to common cold panels.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Findeisen","author_inst":"MVZ Labor Dr. Limbach & Kollegen GbR"},{"author_name":"Hugo Stiegler","author_inst":"MVZLM - Medizinisches Versorgungszentrum f\u00fcr Labormedizin und Mikrobiologie Ruhr GmbH"},{"author_name":"Eloisa Lopez-Calle","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH"},{"author_name":"Tanja Schneider","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH"},{"author_name":"Eva Urlaub","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH"},{"author_name":"Johannes Hayer","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH"},{"author_name":"Claudia Silke Zemmrich","author_inst":"Institute for Pharmacology and Preventive Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patricia Hermes Stoco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Maria Luiza Bazzo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Edmundo Carlos Grisard","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Camila Hernandes","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Luiz Felipe Valter de Oliveira","author_inst":"BiomeHub Biotechnologies"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.03.20179598","rel_title":"Multiplexed, Microscale, Microarray-based Serological Assay for Antibodies Against All Human-Relevant Coronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-09-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.03.20179598","rel_abs":"Rapid, sensitive, and precise multiplexed assays for serological analysis during candidate COVID-19 vaccine development would streamline clinical trials.

Detailed genome cartography of all mutational events (SNPs, indels) was reported and correlated to clinical features of patients. A comparative analysis between our 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from French patients and the reference Wuhan coronavirus genome revealed 315 substitution mutations and six deletion events: ten were in 5\/3 UTR, 178 were nonsynonymous, 126 were synonymous and one generated a stop codon. Six different deleted areas were also identified in nine viral variants. In particular, 30 substitution mutations (18 nonsynonymous) and one deletion ({Delta}21765-21770) concerned the spike S glycoprotein. An average of 7.8 mutational events (+\/- 1.7 SD) and a median of 8 (range, 7-9) were reported per viral isolate. Comparative analyses and clustering of specific mutational signatures in 309 genomes disclose several divisions in groups and subgroups combining their geographical and phylogenetic origin. Clinical outcomes of the 309 COVID-19-infected patients were investigated according to the mutational signatures of viral variants. These findings highlight the genome dynamics of the coronavirus 2019-20 and shed light on the mutational landscape and evolution of this virus.

However, it is still unclear how the virus interferes with immune cell and metabolic functions in the human body. In this study, we investigated the immune response in 10 acute or convalescent COVID19 patients. We characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using flow cytometry and found that CD8+ T cells were significantly subsided in moderate COVID-19 and convalescent patients. Furthermore, characterization of CD8+ T cells suggested that patients with a mild and moderate course of the COVID-19 disease and convalescent patients have significantly diminished expression of both perforin and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells. Using 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the metabolic status of their autologous PBMCs. We found that fructose, lactate and taurine levels were elevated in infected (mild and moderate) patients compared with control and convalescent patients. Glucose, glutamate, formate and acetate levels were attenuated in COVID-19 (mild and moderate) patients. Our findings reveal patients who suffer from an over activation of the immune system, a change of composition in infusion\/intravenous fluids during infection with the aim to lower blood levels of glucose, glutamate, acetate and formate could avoid a life-threatening cytokine storm. In summary, our report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to disrupted CD8+ T cytotoxic functions and changes the overall metabolic functions of immune cells.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yogesh Singh","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University of Tuebingen, Calwerstrasse 7, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christoph Trautwein","author_inst":"Werner Siemens Imaging Center, University of Tuebingen, Roentgenweg 13, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rolf Fendel","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Wilhelmstrasse 27, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Naomi Krickeberg","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Wilhelmstrasse 27, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Held","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Wilhelmstrasse 27, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andrea Kreidenweiss","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Wilhelmstrasse 27, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Georgy Berezhnoy","author_inst":"Werner Siemens Imaging Center, University of Tuebingen, Roentgenweg 13, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rosi Bissinger","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Nephrology, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stephan Ossowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University of Tuebingen, Calwerstrasse 7, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Madhuri S Salker","author_inst":"Research Institute of Women Health, University of Tuebingen, Calwerstrasse 7\/6, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Casadei","author_inst":"NGS Competence Center Tuebingen (NCCT), University of Tuebingen, Calwerstrasse 7, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Olaf Riess","author_inst":"NGS Competence Center Tuebingen (NCCT), University of Tuebingen, Calwerstrasse 7, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"- The DeCOI","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Richard Harrigan","author_inst":"Division of AIDS, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."},{"author_name":"Terrance P Snutch","author_inst":"Michael Smith Laboratories and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Loman","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK."},{"author_name":"Joshua Quick","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.04.277426","rel_title":"Preliminary report of preclinical efficacy and safety analysis of gamma-irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, SK-01 version 1 and OZG-3861 version 1","rel_date":"2020-09-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.277426","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has created an unprecedented health crisis since there is no coronavirus vaccine in the market due to the novelty of this virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have become very important to reduce morbidity and mortality. At this point, inactivated vaccines are important because the straightforward process of existing infrastructure used for several licensed human vaccines can be used for SARS-CoV-2. Inactive vaccines provide an antigenic presentation similar to that when they encounter invasive virus particles of the immune system. In this study, in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy analyzes of lyophilized vaccine candidates inactivated by gamma-irradiation were performed. Our candidate OZG-3861 version 1 (V1) is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, and SK-01 version 1 (V1) is the GM-CSF adjuvant added vaccine candidate. We applied the candidates intradermal to BALB\/c mice to assess the toxicity and immunogenicity of the OZG-3861 V1 and SK-01 V1. Here, we report our preliminary results in vaccinated mice. When considered in terms of T and B cell responses, it was observed that especially the vaccine models containing GM-CSF as an adjuvant caused significant antibody production with neutralization capacity in absence of the antibody-dependent enhancement feature. Another finding showed that the presence of adjuvant is more important in T cell response rather than B cell. The vaccinated mice showed T cell response upon restimulation with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or peptide pool. This study encouraged us to start the challenge test using infective SARS-CoV-2 viruses and our second version of gamma-irradiated inactivated vaccine candidates in humanized ACE2+ mice.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gozde SIR KARAKUS","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Cihan Tastan","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Derya Dilek Kancagi","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Bulut Yurtsever","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Gamze Tumentemur","author_inst":"Vocational School of Health Services, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sevda Demir","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Raife Dilek Turan","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Selen Abanuz","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Didem Cakirsoy","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Utku Seyis","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Samed Ozer","author_inst":"Animal Application and Research Center, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Omer Elibol","author_inst":"Acibadem Altunizade Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Muhammer Elek","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Gurcan Ertop","author_inst":"Vocational School of Health Services, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Serap Arbak","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Merve Acikel Elmas","author_inst":"Histology and Embryology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Cansu Hemsinlioglu","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ayse Sesin Kocagoz","author_inst":"Acibadem Altunizade Hospital, Infectious Disease Unit, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ozden Hatirnaz Ng","author_inst":"Medical Biology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sezer Akyoney","author_inst":"Medical Biology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ilayda Sahin","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ugur Ozbek","author_inst":"Medical Genetics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Dilek Telci","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Fikrettin Sahin","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Koray Yalcin","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.04.280081","rel_title":"Monoclonal Antibodies Capable of Binding SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Motif Specifically Prevent GM-CSF Induction.","rel_date":"2020-09-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.280081","rel_abs":"A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a pandemic COVID-19 disease that infected more than 25.6 million and killed 852,000 people worldwide. Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibody responses. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human monocyte and murine macrophage cultures. Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited \"cytokine storm\", and provided a potentially useful criteria for future assessment of innate immune-modulating properties of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryRBM-binding Antibodies Inhibit GM-CSF Induction.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoling Qiang","author_inst":"The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Shu Zhu","author_inst":"The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Li","author_inst":"The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Ping Wang","author_inst":"The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Kevin J.

Identifying virus-host protein interactions can thus uncover unique opportunities for interfering with the virus life cycle via novel drug compounds or drug repurposing. Importantly, many viral-host protein interactions take place at intracellular membranes and poorly soluble organelles, which are difficult to profile using classical biochemical purification approaches. Applying proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) with the fast-acting miniTurbo enzyme to 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549), we detected 7810 proximity interactions (7382 of which are new for SARS-CoV-2) with 2242 host proteins (results available at covid19interactome.org). These results complement and dramatically expand upon recent affinity purification-based studies identifying stable host-virus protein complexes, and offer an unparalleled view of membrane-associated processes critical for viral production. Host cell organellar markers were also subjected to BioID in parallel, allowing us to propose modes of action for several viral proteins in the context of host proteome remodelling. In summary, our dataset identifies numerous high confidence proximity partners for SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and describes potential mechanisms for their effects on specific host cell functions.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Hala Abdouni","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"James D.R.

Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric fully glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1. Our results show that fully glycosylated trimeric RBD proteins are attractive to analyze receptor binding and explore ACE2 expression profiles in tissues.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kim Marielle Bouwman","author_inst":"Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Hannah L Turner","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roosmarijn van der Woude","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Gerlof P Bosman","author_inst":"Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Sander Herfst","author_inst":"ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Barry Rockx","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan Boons","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Robert Paul de Vries","author_inst":"Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Brett Larsen","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Cassandra J.

Since we have little prior information about the newly emerged coronavirus, we applied unsupervised clustering algorithms to group 16,873 SARS-CoV-2 strains, which automatically minimize intra-cluster distances and maximize inter-cluster distances. Six distinct genomic clusters were identified, with mutation profiles as input features. The varied proportions of the six clusters within different continents revealed specific geographical distributions. Comprehensive analysis indicated that genetic factors and human migration played an important role in shaping the specific geographical distribution of population structure. This study provides a concrete framework for the use of clustering methods in phylogenetic analysis to study the global population structure of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, clustering methods can be used for future studies of variant population structures in specific regions of these fast-growing viruses.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yawei Li","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qingyun Liu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.

A sizeable number of infections remain undetected, and a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 are not tested.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S Muhammad  Salim Khan","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Mariya  Amin Qurieshi","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Inaamul Haq","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Sabhiya Majid","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Arif  Akbar Bhat","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Sahila Nabi","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Nisar  Ahmad Ganai","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Nazia Zahoor","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Auqfeen Nisar","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Iqra  Nisar Chowdri","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Tanzeela  Bashir Qazi","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Rafiya Kousar","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Abdul  Aziz Lone","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Iram Sabah","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Shahroz Nabi","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Ishtiyaq  Ahmad Sumji","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Misbah  Ferooz Kawoosa","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Shifana Ayoub","author_inst":"Government Medical College Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Ozden Hatirnaz Ng","author_inst":"Medical Biology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sezer Akyoney","author_inst":"Medical Biology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ilayda Sahin","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ugur Ozbek","author_inst":"Medical Genetics Department, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Dilek Telci","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Fikrettin Sahin","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Koray Yalcin","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20185793","rel_title":"Prognostic accuracy of emergency department triage tools for children with suspected COVID-19: The PRIEST observational cohort study","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20185793","rel_abs":"Objectives: Emergency department clinicians can use triage tools to predict adverse outcome and support management decisions for children presenting with suspected COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 44 EDs across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected data from children attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment using the WHO algorithm, swine flu hospital pathway for children (SFHPC), Paediatric Observation Priority Score (POPS) and Childrens Observation and Severity Tool (COAST). We recorded 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results: We collected data from 1530 children, including 26 (1.7%) with an adverse outcome. C-statistics were 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.87) for the WHO algorithm, 0.80 (0.71-0.90) for POPS, 0.76 (0.67-0.85) for COAST, and 0.71 (0.59-0.82) for SFHPC. Using pre-specified thresholds, the WHO algorithm had the highest sensitivity (0.85) and lowest specificity (0.75), but POPS and COAST could optimise sensitivity (0.96 and 0.92 respectively) at the expense of specificity (0.25 and 0.38 respectively) by using a threshold of any score above zero instead of the pre-specified threshold. Conclusion: Existing triage tools have good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in children with suspected COVID-19. POPS and COAST could achieve an appropriate balance of sensitivity and specificity for supporting decisions to discharge home by considering any score above zero to be positive.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katie Biggs","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ben Thomas","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Steve Goodacre","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ellen Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Laura Sutton","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bursnall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Amanda Loban","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Simon Waterhouse","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Richard Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Carl Marincowitz","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fikrettin Sahin","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Koray Yalcin","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.29.20184325","rel_title":"Face-masking, an acceptable protective measure against COVID-19: Findings of Ugandan high-risk groups","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.29.20184325","rel_abs":"Face-masking could reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

It is not clear whether the use of biologic agents may suppose a risk or protection against SARSCoV2 infection however, it has been suggested that severe respiratory forms of COVID19 occur as result of exacerbated inflammation status and cytokine production. This prompted the use of IL6 (tocilizumab and sarilumab) and IL1 inhibitors (anakinra) in severe COVID19 disease and more recently JAK1\/2 inhibitor (baricitinib). Therefore, patients with rheumatic diseases provide a great opportunity to learn about the use of biological agents as protective drugs against SARSCoV2. Objectives: To estimate COVID19 infection rate in patients treated with biologic agents for rheumatic inflammatory diseases, determine the influence of biologic agents treatment as a risk or protective factor and studying the prognosis of rheumatic patients receiving biologic agents compared to general population in a third level Hospital setting in Leon, Spain. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study including patients seen at Rheumatology department who received biological therapy for rheumatic diseases between December 1st 2019 and June 1st 2020 and analysed COVID19 infection rate. All patients being attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic with diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease receiving treatment with biologic agents were included. Main variable was the hospital admission related to COVID19. The covariates were age, sex, comorbidities, biologic agent and need for hospitalization. We performed a multivariate logistic regression model to assess risk factors of hospital admission. Results: There was a total of 3711 patients with COVID19 requiring hospitalization. 30 patients out of a total of 820 patients (3.6%) receiving biological therapy had contracted COVID19 and four required hospital care. Crude incidence rate of COVID19 requiring hospital care among the general population was 2.75%, and it was 0.48% among the group with underlying rheumatic diseases. A total of 423 patients died, 2 of which received treatment with biologic agents. Patients who tested positive for COVID19 were older (female: median age 61.8 IQR 46.5 to 75; male: median age 68 IQR 48.5 to 72) than those who were negative for COVID19 (female: median age 58.4 IQR 48 to 69; male: median age 55.9 IQR 46 to 66) and more likely to have cardiovascular disease (27 % vs 10%, OR 3. 41 (CI 1.47 to 7.94), p 0.004), be active smokers (13% vs 5%, OR 3.14 (CI 1.04 to 9.47), p 0.04) and receiving treatment with IL-12\/23 inhibitors (6.7% vs 1.4%, OR 5.06 (CI 1.07 to 23.91) and rituximab (13% vs 2%, 2.66 (CI 1.03 to 7.27), p 0.04) and were less likely to be receiving treatment with IL6 inhibitors (0% vs 14%, CI (0.006 to 0.97, p <0.05). When exploring the effect of the rest of the therapies between groups (affected patients vs unaffected), we found no significant differences in bsDMARD proportions. IL1 inhibitors, IL6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors and belimumab treated patients showed the lowest incidence of COVID19 among adult rheumatic patients. We found no differences in sex or rheumatological disease between patients who tested positive for COVID19 and patients who tested negative were found. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that use of biological therapy does not associate with severe manifestations of COVID19, and it is likely to have a protective effect against them when compared to the general population.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cristiana Sieiro Santos","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Xenia Casas Fernandez","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Clara Moriano Morales","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Elvira Alvarez Diez","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Carolina Alvarez Castro","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Alejandra Lopez Robles","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Trinidad Perez Sandoval","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Simon Waterhouse","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Richard Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Carl Marincowitz","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fikrettin Sahin","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Koray Yalcin","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"rheumatology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20185876","rel_title":"Dark matter, second waves and epidemiological modelling","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20185876","rel_abs":"Background Recent reports based on conventional SEIR models suggest that the next wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK could overwhelm health services, with fatalities that far exceed the first wave. These models suggest non-pharmaceutical interventions would have limited impact without intermittent national lockdowns and consequent economic and health impacts. We used Bayesian model comparison to revisit these conclusions, when allowing for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility, and viral transmission. Methods We used dynamic causal modelling to estimate the parameters of epidemiological models and, crucially, the evidence for alternative models of the same data. We compared SEIR models of immune status that were equipped with latent factors generating data; namely, location, symptom, and testing status. We analysed daily cases and deaths from the US, UK, Brazil, Italy, France, Spain, Mexico, Belgium, Germany, and Canada over the period 25-Jan-20 to 15-Jun-20. These data were used to estimate the composition of each country's population in terms of the proportions of people (i) not exposed to the virus, (ii) not susceptible to infection when exposed, and (iii) not infectious when susceptible to infection. Findings Bayesian model comparison found overwhelming evidence for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility, and transmission. Furthermore, both lockdown and the build-up of population immunity contributed to viral transmission in all but one country. Small variations in heterogeneity were sufficient to explain the large differences in mortality rates across countries. The best model of UK data predicts a second surge of fatalities will be much less than the first peak (31 vs. 998 deaths per day. 95% CI: 24-37)--substantially less than conventional model predictions. The size of the second wave depends sensitively upon the loss of immunity and the efficacy of find-test-trace-isolate-support (FTTIS) programmes. Interpretation A dynamic causal model that incorporates heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission suggests that the next wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be much smaller than conventional models predict, with less economic and health disruption. This heterogeneity means that seroprevalence underestimates effective herd immunity and, crucially, the potential of public health programmes.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karl Friston","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Anthony Costello","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Elvira Alvarez Diez","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Carolina Alvarez Castro","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Alejandra Lopez Robles","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Trinidad Perez Sandoval","author_inst":"Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon"},{"author_name":"Simon Waterhouse","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Richard Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Carl Marincowitz","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fikrettin Sahin","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Koray Yalcin","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20182220","rel_title":"Cross-reactive antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal common cold coronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20182220","rel_abs":"Beyond SARS-CoV-2, six more coronaviruses infect humans (hCoVs), four of which cause only mild symptoms (seasonal\/common cold hCoVs). Previous exposures to seasonal hCoVs may elicit immunological memory that could benefit the course of SARS-CoV-2 infections. While cross-reactive T cells epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal hCoVs have been reported in individuals unexposed to SARS-CoV-2, potential antibody-based cross-reactivity is incompletely understood. Here, we have probed for high resolution antibody binding against all hCoVs represented as 1,539 peptides with a phage-displayed antigen library. We detected broad serum antibody responses against peptides of seasonal hCoVs in up to 75% of individuals. Recovered COVID-19 patients exhibited distinct antibody repertoires targeting variable SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, and could be accurately classified from unexposed individuals (AUC=0.96). Up to 50% of recovered patients also mounted antibody responses against unique epitopes of seasonal hCoV-OC43, that were not detectable in unexposed individuals. These results indicate substantial interindividual variability and antibody cross-reactivity between hCoVs from the direction of SARS-CoV-2 infections towards seasonal hCoVs.

The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed hospitals in several areas in high-income countries. An effective response to this pandemic requires healthcare workers (HCWs) to be present at work, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where they are already in critically low supply. To inform whether and to what degree policymakers in Bangladesh, and LMICs more broadly, should expect a drop in HCW attendance as COVID-19 continues to spread, this study aims to determine how HCW attendance has changed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Methods. This study analyzed daily fingerprint-verified attendance data from all 527 public-sector secondary and tertiary care facilities in Bangladesh to describe HCW attendance from January 26, 2019 to March 22, 2020, by cadre, hospital type, and geographic division. We then regressed HCW attendance onto fixed effects for day-of-week, month, and hospital, as well as indicators for each of three pandemic periods: a China-focused period (January 11, 2020 [first confirmed COVID-19 death in China] until January 29, 2020), international-spread period (January 30, 2020 [World Health Organization declared a global emergency] until March 6, 2020), and local-spread period (March 7, 2020 [first confirmed COVID-19 case in Bangladesh] until the end of the study period). Findings. On average between January 26, 2019 and March 22, 2020, 34.1% of doctors, 64.6% of nurses, and 70.6% of other healthcare staff were present for their scheduled shift. Attendance rate increased with time in 2019 among all cadres. Attendance level of nurses dropped by 2.5% points (95% CI; -3.2% to -1.8%) and 3.5% points (95% CI; -4.5% to -2.5%) during the international-spread and the local-spread periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to the China-focused period. Similarly, the attendance level of other healthcare staff declined by 0.3% points (95% CI; -0.8% to 0.2%) and 2.3% points (95% CI; -3.0% to -1.6%) during the international-spread and local-spread periods, respectively. Among doctors, however, the international-spread and local-spread periods were associated with a statistically significant increase in attendance by 3.7% points (95% CI; 2.5% to 4.8%) and 4.9% points (95% CI; 3.5% to 6.4%), respectively. The reduction in attendance levels across all HCWs during the local-spread period was much greater at large hospitals, where the majority of COVID-19 testing and treatment took place, than that at small hospitals. Conclusions. After a year of significant improvements, attendance levels among nurses and other healthcare staff (who form the majority of the healthcare workforce in Bangladesh) have declined during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding may portend an even greater decrease in attendance if COVID-19 continues to spread in Bangladesh. Policymakers in Bangladesh and similar LMICs should undertake major efforts to achieve high attendance levels among HCWs, particularly nurses, such as by providing sufficient personal protective equipment as well as monetary and non-monetary incentives.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Duy Do","author_inst":"Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, University of Heidelberg; Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Malabika Sarker","author_inst":"James P.

Methods Mental health status and sleep quality were using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) questionnaire across four time periods. Psychology interventions were carried out from the third period. Results Students in the third period had higher PSQI total scores [mean (SD), 6.01 (3.27)] than those in the first period [5.60 (3.11)], second period [4.17 (2.10)] and fourth period [4.09 (2.80)]. After adjustment for covariates there was a decline of 1.89 points in the PSQI in the fourth period compared with the highest period. The SCL-90-R scores were highest in the second period [121.19 (47.83)], and were higher than the scores in the first [107.60 (52.21)] and second period [107.79 (27.20)] and lowest in the fourth period [97.82 (17.12)]. The decline in scores was 23.38 points after adjustment for covariates. The prevalence of psychological distress and sleep disturbances respectively decreased from 28.6% to 11.7% and from 10.4% to 2.6% comparing to the highest period. Sleep quality showed a significant positive correlation with mental health status. Conclusions The pattern of change in mental health status was different to that of sleep quality. The implementation of comprehensive psychology intervention may improve mental health and sleep quality. These findings may inform public health policy during the reopening of schools in other regions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Yu Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Environment Factors and Cancer, Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, School of Publi"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Gu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Ma","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhuang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Ziqi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Lingli Sang","author_inst":"Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Yitian Luo","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Yulong Lian","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fikrettin Sahin","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Koray Yalcin","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20186387","rel_title":"Systematic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein derived peptides for diagnosis of COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20186387","rel_abs":"Serological test plays an essential role in monitoring and combating COVID-19 pandemic. Recombinant spike protein (S protein), especially S1 protein is one of the major reagents for serological tests. However, the high cost in production of S protein, and the possible cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses poses unneglectable challenges. Taking advantage of a peptide microarray of full spike protein coverage, we analyzed 2,434 sera from 858 COVID-19 patients, sera from 63 asymptomatic patients and 610 controls collected from multiple clinical centers. Based on the results of the peptide microarray, we identified several S protein derived 12-mer peptides that have high diagnosis performance. Particularly, for monitoring IgG response, one peptide (aa 1148-1159 or S2-78) has a comparable sensitivity (95.5%, 95% CI 93.7-96.9%) and specificity (96.7%, 95% CI 94.8-98.0%) to that of S1 protein for detection of both COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic infections. Furthermore, the performance of S2-78 IgG for diagnosis was successfully validated by ELISA with an independent sample cohort. By combining S2-78\/ S1 with other peptides, a two-step strategy was proposed to ensure both the sensitivity and specificity of S protein based serological assay. The peptide\/s identified in this study could be applied independently or in combination with S1 protein for accurate, affordable, and accessible COVID-19 diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Danyun Lai","author_inst":"Shanghai JiaoTong University"},{"author_name":"Qing Lei","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhaowei Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hongyan Hou","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Feng Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xionglin Fan","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yulong Lian","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fikrettin Sahin","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Koray Yalcin","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20186395","rel_title":"Age-dependence of healthcare interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ontario, Canada","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20186395","rel_abs":"Background: Patient age is the most salient clinical indicator of risk from COVID-19. Age-specific distributions of known SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related deaths are available for most countries. However, relatively little attention has been given to the age distributions of hospitalizations and serious healthcare interventions administered to COVID-19 patients. We examined these distributions in Ontario, Canada, in order to quantify the age-related impacts of COVID-19, and to identify potential risks should the healthcare system become overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients in the future. Methods: We analysed known SARS-CoV-2 infection records from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) and the Toronto Public Health Coronavirus Rapid Entry System (CORES) between 23 January 2020 and 17 June 2020 (N = 30,546), and estimated the age distributions of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, intubations, and ventilations. We quantified the probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization. Results: The distribution of COVID-19-related hospitalizations peaks with a wide plateau covering ages 54-90, whereas deaths are sharply concentrated in very old ages, with a maximum at age 90. The estimated probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection reaches a maximum of 32.0% at age 75 (95% CI 27.5%-36.7%). The probability of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization is uncertain for children (due to small sample size), and near 100% for adults younger than 40. After age 40, survival of hospitalized COVID-19 patients declines substantially; for example, a hospitalized 50-year-old patient has a 90.4% chance of surviving COVID-19 (95% CI 81.9%-95.7%). Interpretation: Concerted efforts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have kept prevalence of the virus low in the population of Ontario. The healthcare system has not been overstretched, yet the probability of survival given hospitalization for COVID-19 has been lower than is generally recognized for patients over 40. If prevalence of the virus were to increase and healthcare capacities were to be exceeded, survival of individuals in the broad age range requiring acute care would be expected to decrease, potentially expanding the distribution of COVID-19-related deaths toward younger ages.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Irena Papst","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Michael Li","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"David Champredon","author_inst":"University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Benjamin M Bolker","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Dushoff","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"David J D Earn","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Feng Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xionglin Fan","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yulong Lian","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fikrettin Sahin","author_inst":"Genetic and Bioengineering Department, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Koray Yalcin","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ercument Ovali","author_inst":"Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20185280","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Protein in Wastewater Mirrors COVID-19 Prevalence.","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20185280","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to diverse approaches to track infections.

Most groups report low levels of viral RNA that often skirt the methods theoretical limits of detection and quantitation. Here, we demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in wastewater using traditional immunoblotting and quantitate them from wastewater solids using an immuno-linked PCR method called Multiplex Paired-antibody Amplified Detection (MPAD). In this longitudinal study, we corrected for stochastic variability inherent to wastewater-based epidemiology using multiple fecal content protein biomarkers. These normalized SARS-CoV-2 protein data correlated well with public health metrics. Our method of assaying SARS-CoV-2 protein from wastewater represents a promising and sensitive epidemiological tool to assess prevalence of fecally-shed pathogens in the community.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nafisa Neault","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada, K1H 8L1"},{"author_name":"Aiman T.

Hence, we aim to use the combination of symptoms to build a regression model as a screening tool to identify people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be prioritized for testing. Materials and Methods: We applied machine learning techniques and provided a visualization of potential regions with high densities of COVID-19 as a risk map. We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals registered in \"Dados do Bem\", an app-based symptom tracker in use in Brazil. Results: From April 28 to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms through the app. Of these, 49,721 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, being 5,888 (11.8%) positive. Among self-reported symptoms, loss of smell (OR[95%CI]: 4.6 [4.4 - 4.9]), fever (2.6 [2.5 - 2.8]), and shortness of breath (2.1 [1.6-2.7]) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our final model obtained a competitive performance, with only 7% of false-negative users among the predicted as negatives (NPV = 0.93). From the 287,714 users still not tested, our model estimated that only 34.5% are potentially infected, thus reducing the need for extensive testing of all registered users. The model was incorporated by the \"Dados do Bem\" app aiming to prioritize users for testing. We developed an external validation in the state of Goias and found that of the 465 users selected, 52% tested positive. Conclusions: Our results showed that the combination of symptoms might predict SARS-Cov-2 infection and, therefore, can be used as a tool by decision-makers to refine testing and disease control strategies.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"LEILA F.

Summary answer: Most of the participants in this study wanted to continue treatment. What is known already: The effect of the prevalence of infectious diseases including the Zika virus on the attitude of infertile couples has been studied in very few studies. However, the effect of the outbreak of COVID-19 on the attitude of infertile couples has not been investigated. Study design, size, duration: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study on forty-six infertile couples (n=92) who referred to our infertility clinic from 4 March 2020 through 20 June 2020. Participants\/materials, settings, methods: This study is based on potential infertile couples for treatment with assisted reproductive technology (ART) who referred to our infertility clinic, Sari, Iran (median age of 35.5 years). All individuals with primary infertility, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and candidates for ART, were included in the study. People who did not agree to participate in the study were excluded. Subjects were surveyed using a researcher-made questionnaire. This questionnaire has four sections as follows: The first part included demographic information and clinical characteristics, the second part included medical records, the third part included questions related to assessing the level of awareness regarding coronavirus infection, and the fourth part included questions related to the attitude towards continuing infertility treatment. The validity of this questionnaire was assessed by three infertility specialists and was confirmed with Cronbachs alpha of 0.78. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Main results and the role of chance: There is no significant relationship between COVID-19 symptoms and the level of awareness (P-value <0.05). Thirty-two patients (33.33%) had decreased motivation to continue treatment during COVID-19 pandemic. Fear of transmission to the fetus (28.13%) had the highest frequency among the causes of decreased motivation to continue treatment (P-value = 0.011). Confidence in support of the treatment team (56.67%) was the most common reason for lack of motivation in people without decreased motivation (P-value <0.001). The majority of patients had a very high or high tendency (65.22%) to continue or start treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic (P-value <0.001). Most people had an average fear of getting the disease (39.13%) (value <0.001). Examining the relationship between the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and attitude level variables showed that there is only a significant relationship between the greater desire to have a child and the continuation or initiation of treatment with the presence of COVID-19 symptoms (P-value = 0.032). Limitations, reasons for caution: We were not able to fully assess patients' deep feelings and cultural beliefs, due to the use of questionnaires and the lack of interviews. Wider implications of the findings: Our results showed for the first time that patients' knowledge about COVID-19 and trust in the treatment staff played an effective role in selecting and continuing infertility treatment. To clarify this issue, studies with the larger statistical community in the form of interviews are needed. Study funding\/completing interest(s): The study received financial support from the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (Grant number: 7903).
