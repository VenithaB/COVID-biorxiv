Here, we analyse 196 SARS-Cov-2 genomes collected between Jan 24 and Mar 24 2020, and perform a phylodynamics analysis. In particular, we analyse the doubling time, reproduction number (Rt) and infection duration associated with the epidemic wave that was detected in incidence data starting from Feb 27. Different models suggest a slowing down of the epidemic in Mar, which would be consistent with the implementation of the national lock-down on Mar 17. The inferred distributions for the effective infection duration and Rt are in line with those estimated from contact tracing data. Finally, based on the available sequence data, we estimate that the French epidemic wave originated between mid-Jan and early Feb. Overall, this analysis shows the potential to use sequence genomic data to inform public health decisions in an epidemic crisis context and calls for further analyses with denser sampling.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gonch\u00e9 Danesh","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Elie","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Yannis Michalakis","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"Mircea T.

A Boosted Regression Tree model has been employed to understand the association between the COVID-19 cases. The results show that average temperature and average relative humidity are the major contributors in explaining the differentials of COVID-19 transmission in temperate and subtropical regions whereas the mean diurnal temperature range and temperature seasonality are the most significant determinants in tropical regions. The average temperature is the most influential factor affecting the number of COVID-19 cases in France, Turkey, the US, the UK, and Germany, and the cases decrease sharply above 10oC. Among the tropical countries, India found to be most affected by mean diurnal temperature, and Brazil fazed by temperature seasonality. Most of the temperate countries like France, USA, Turkey, UK, and Germany with an average temperature between 5-12oC had high number of COVID-19 cases. The findings are expected to add to the ongoing debates on the influence of climatic factors influencing the number of COVID-19 cases and could help researchers and policymakers to make appropriate decisions for preventing the spread.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malay Pramanik","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Koushik Chowdhury","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Md Juel Rana","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Praffulit Bisht","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Raghunath Pal","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Szabo","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Indrajit Pal","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bhagirath Behera","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Liang","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Sabu S.

One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact health is through effects on sleep. We used data from 48,723 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01\/04\/2020-12\/05\/2020 to study the association between adversities and sleep quality. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models to account for all time-invariant confounders. Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to employment and finances. Having a larger social network offered some buffering effects on associations but there was limited further evidence of moderation by social or psychiatric factors. Poor sleep may be a mechanism by which COVID-19 adversities are affecting mental health. This highlights the importance of interventions that support adaptive coping strategies during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liam Wright","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Praffulit Bisht","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Raghunath Pal","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Szabo","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Indrajit Pal","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bhagirath Behera","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Liang","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Sabu S.

This research aims to study the possible correlation between the numbers of swab tests and confirmed cases of infection, with special attention to the sickness level. Study Design: The study is carried out with reference to the Italian case, but the result is of more general importance, in particular for countries with limited availability of ICUs (intensive care units). Methods: The statistical analysis shows correlation between the number of swab tests and those of daily positive cases, mild cases admitted to hospital, intensive care cases, recovery, and death rate, and provides a basis to carry on an AI study. The results were validated using a multivariate linear regression (MLR) approach. Results: Our main result is the identification of a significant statistical effect of reduction of the pressure on the Health system as result of the increase of the tests. The relevance of this result is not confined to the COVID-19 outbreak, because the high demand of hospitalizations and ICU treatments due to this pandemic has an indirect effect on the possibility of guaranteeing an adequate treatment for other high-fatality disease, such as e.g. cardiological, and oncological. Conclusions: Our results show that swab testing may play a major role to decrease the stress on the Health system of a country. Therefore, this case study is relevant in particular for the planning of the control of the pandemic in countries with a limited capacity of admission to ICU s units.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Behzad Pirouz","author_inst":"Department of Computer Engineering, Modelling, Electronics and Systems Engineering, University of Calabria, Rende 87036, Italy"},{"author_name":"Hana Javadi Nejad","author_inst":"University of Calabria, Rende 87036, Italy"},{"author_name":"Galileo Violini","author_inst":"Centro Internacional de Fisica, Bogota, Colombia;  University of Calabria, Rende 87036, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Behrouz Pirouz","author_inst":"University of Calabria"},{"author_name":"Raghunath Pal","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Szabo","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Indrajit Pal","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bhagirath Behera","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Liang","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Sabu S.

Methods A modified SECIR compartment model was used to estimate the number of severe COVID-19 cases at the peak of the outbreak. Projections of the number of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators needed at outbreak peak were generated for four scenarios (if 30, 50, 70, or 100% of patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms seek health services) assuming that all people with severe infections would require hospitalization, that 4.72% would require ICU admission, and that 2.3% would require mechanical ventilation. Findings Across the 52 countries included in this analysis, the average number of severe COVID-19 cases projected at outbreak peak was 138 per 100,000 (SD: 9.6). Comparing current national capacities to estimated needs at outbreak peak, we found that 31of 50 countries (62%) do not have a sufficient number of hospital beds per 100,000 people if 100% of patients with severe infections seek out health services and assuming that all hospital beds are empty and available for use by patients with COVID-19. If only 30% of patients seek out health services then 10 of 50 countries (20%) do not have sufficient hospital bed capacity. The average number of ICU beds needed at outbreak peak across the 52 included countries ranged from 2 per 100,000 people (SD: 0.1) when 30% of people with severe COVID-19 infections access health services to 6.5 per 100,000 (SD: 0.5) assuming 100% of people seek out health services. Even if only 30% of severely infected patients seek health services at outbreak peak, then 34 of 48 countries (71%) do not have a sufficient number of ICU beds per 100,000 people to handle projected need. Only four countries (Cabo Verde, Egypt, Gabon, and South Africa) have a sufficient number of ventilators to meet projected national needs if 100% of severely infected individuals seek health services assuming all ventilators are functioning and available for COVID-19 patients, while 35 other countries require two or more additional ventilators per 100,000 people.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica Craig","author_inst":"CDDEP"},{"author_name":"Erta Kalanxhi","author_inst":"CDDEP"},{"author_name":"Gilbert Osena","author_inst":"CDDEP"},{"author_name":"Isabel Frost","author_inst":"CDDEP"},{"author_name":"Raghunath Pal","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Szabo","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Indrajit Pal","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bhagirath Behera","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Liang","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Sabu S.

We investigated two soluble markers of monocyte activation, sCD14 and sCD163, in covid19 patients with the aim of characterizing their potential role in monocyte-macrophage disease immunopathology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind. Methods. Fifty-nine SARS-Cov-2 positive hospitalized patients, classified according to ICU or non-ICU admission requirement, were prospectively recruited and analyzed by ELISA for levels of sCD14 and sCD163, along with other laboratory parameters, and compared to a healthy control group. Results. sCD14 and sCD163 levels were significantly higher among COVID-19 patients, independently of ICU admission requirement, compared to the control group. We found a significant correlation between sCD14 levels and other inflammatory markers, particularly Interleukin-6, in the non-ICU patients group. sCD163 showed a moderate positive correlation with the time at sampling from admission, increasing its value over time, independently of severity group. Conclusions. Monocyte-macrophage activation markers are increased and correlate with other inflammatory markers in SARS-Cov-2 infection, in association to hospital admission. These data suggest a potentially preponderant role for monocyte-macrophage activation in the development of immunopathology of covid19 patients.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Gomez Rial","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Curras Tuala","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Irene Rivero Calle","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Alberto Gomez Carballa","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Miriam Cebey Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Carmen Rodriguez Tenreiro","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Ana Dacosta Urbieta","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Carmen Rivero Velasco","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Nuria Rodriguez Nunez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Rocio Trastoy Pena","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Javier Rodriguez Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Antonio Salas","author_inst":"Universidad Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Federico Martinon Torres","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Vincent Enouf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Samuel Alizon","author_inst":"CNRS"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120774","rel_title":"Quantifying the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 long-term shedding among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120774","rel_abs":"Analysis of 851 COVID-19 patients with a SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR at follow-up shows 99 patients remained SARS-CoV-2-positive after four weeks from initial diagnosis.

Since the first sequenced whole-genome of SARS-CoV-2 on January 2020, the identification of its genetic variants has become crucial in tracking and evaluating their spread across the globe.\n\nIn this study, we compared 15,259 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 60 countries since the outbreak of this novel coronavirus with the first sequenced genome in Wuhan to quantify the evolutionary divergence of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we compared the codon usage patterns, every two weeks, of 13 of SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding for the membrane protein (M), envelope (E), spike surface glycoprotein (S), nucleoprotein (N), non-structural 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), ssRNA-binding protein (RBP), 2-O-ribose methyltransferase (OMT), endoRNase (RNase), helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Nsp7, Nsp8, and exonuclease ExoN.\n\nAs a general rule, we find that SARS-CoV-2 genome tends to diverge over time by accumulating mutations on its genome and, specifically, on the coding sequences for proteins N and S. Interestingly, different patterns of codon usage were observed among these genes. Genes S, Nsp7, NSp8, tend to use a norrower set of synonymous codons that are better optimized to the human host. Conversely, genes E and M consistently use a broader set of synonymous codons, which does not vary with respect to the reference genome. We identified key SARS-CoV-2 genes (S, N, ExoN, RNase, RdRp, Nsp7 and Nsp8) suggested to be causally implicated in the virus adaptation to the human host.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maddalena Dilucca","author_inst":"La Sapienza, Roma"},{"author_name":"Sergio Forcelloni","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giansanti","author_inst":"Sapienza Universita di Roma"},{"author_name":"Alexandros Georgakilas","author_inst":"National Technical University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Athanasia Pavlopoulou","author_inst":"Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University"},{"author_name":"Douglas W.

Design Cross-sectional study using survey questionnaire. Setting Healthcare industry: St Mary's Hospital, a small NHS district hospital on the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom. Participants NHS staff members employed by the Isle of Wight NHS Trust. Results Of 3100 eligible staff members, 462 (~15%) responded to the survey. Of the respondents, 90% were aged between 31 and 65, and half had direct patient contact through their job role. Almost three quarters (73%) used social media apps on their smartphones. 421 out of 460 respondents had no trouble downloading and installing the NHSX Covid app on their smartphones. 20% of respondents were left confused by instructions to turn off Bluetooth when wearing PPE. Only 35 people either had to report symptoms or received an alert of contact with a suspected covid case. Of these over 20% were not clear what to do in such a situation. Conclusions The trial app has been embraced and adopted well. Many have experienced no problems with it. However, some healthcare workers have been unable to download or install the app due to compatibility issues and some have been left confused by having to turn off Bluetooth whilst wearing PPE. This raises questions as to the effectiveness of the app for its intended purpose in contact tracing efforts. Recommendations We recommend that the wording of alerts and guidance provided by the app be made clearer and more accessible. We also recommend developments to the app to facilitate use by healthcare workers in a clinical setting. We also propose that \"app instructors\" be made available in hospitals to ensure that patients and staff can access help and advice on use of the app.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua Filer","author_inst":"Isle of Wight NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Daniel Gheorghiu","author_inst":"Isle of Wight NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giansanti","author_inst":"Sapienza Universita di Roma"},{"author_name":"Alexandros Georgakilas","author_inst":"National Technical University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Athanasia Pavlopoulou","author_inst":"Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University"},{"author_name":"Douglas W.

The Covid-19 death rate increases exponentially with age, and the main risk factors are age itself, as well as having underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, severe chronic respiratory disease and cancer. Furthermore, the almost complete lack of deaths in children suggests that infection alone is not sufficient to cause death; rather, one must have gone through a number of changes, either as a result of undefined aspects of aging, or as a result of chronic disease. These characteristics of Covid-19 death are consistent with the multistep model of disease, a model which has primarily been used for cancer, and more recently for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We applied the multi-step model to data on Covid-19 case fatality rates (CFRs) from China, South Korea, Italy, Spain and Japan. In all countries we found that a plot of ln (CFR) against ln (age) was approximately linear with a slope of about 5. As a comparison, we also conducted similar analyses for selected other respiratory diseases. SARS showed a similar log-log age-pattern to that of Covid-19, albeit with a lower slope, whereas seasonal and pandemic influenza showed quite different age-patterns. Thus, death from Covid-19 and SARS appears to follow a distinct age-pattern, consistent with a multistep model of disease that in the case of Covid-19 is probably defined by comorbidities and age producing immune-related susceptibility. Identification of these steps would be potentially important for prevention and therapy for SARS-COV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neil Pearce","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Giovenale Moirano","author_inst":"University of Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Milena Maule","author_inst":"University of Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Manolis Kogevinas","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Xavier Rodo","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Deborah Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jan Vandenbroucke","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

None of these tests should be used for the diagnosis or population screening of the disease, considering that the antibodies appear only on the 8th - 14th day of the disease onset. The present study evaluates a sample of immunofluorescent and immunochromatographic rapid tests to show their agreement in relation to Chemiluminescence. Methods A diagnostic test evaluation assay was performed to establish the performance of five rapid tests (4 immunochromatographic and 1 immunofluorescent tests) for IgG and IgM serology for SARS-CoV-2 using a panel of 30 serum samples from patients received in the laboratory analysis routine. For the evaluation of clinical performance, the qualitative results of the rapid tests were compared against those obtained by chemiluminescence, dichotomized as positives (>>10 AU \/ mL) or negative (<10 UA \/ mL). Findings The best agreement is seen in the immunofluorescent assay, for the IgG contrast, with a particularly good kappa index (0.85), without positive disagreements and a negative disagreement of about 15%. In the immunochromatographic methods Kappa index was 0.61 at best, with disagreements in negative findings of {approx}35% and in positive cases of up to {approx}70%. The IgM concordance behavior, on the other hand, reflects a weak to moderate Kappa concordance value (Kappa 0.2 to 0.6), with negative disagreements reaching up to 55% and positives of up to 84%, without any evaluated test reaching Kappa performance equal to or greater than 0.8. Interpretation Serological studies should be used in the clinical and epidemiological context and of other diagnostic tests. Given the high demand and supply in the market of \"rapid serological tests\", its evaluation against panels of serologically positive or negative samples established by Chemiluminescence or Electro chemiluminescence is essential to authorize its extensive use in populations Funding None","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Klever V Saenz-Flor Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad Central del Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Lorena M Santafe Sr.","author_inst":"Synlab Solutions in Diagnostics Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Milena Maule","author_inst":"University of Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Manolis Kogevinas","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Xavier Rodo","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Deborah Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jan Vandenbroucke","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

A large number of patients affected by the SARS-Cov-2 virus worldwide undergo recovery of symptoms in about one month. Among these patients, the healing process is still under observation, with some patients in need of careful clinical monitoring. While the radiological findings have been shown to regress almost completely, little knowledge is available at the moment about other complications in the lung and in other organs. We then investigated the lung perfusion conditions in patients affected by COVID- 19 during recovery. Method. We retrospectively studied 20 patients, from 14 to 60 days after resolution of the COVID-19 symptoms, using chest CT. In a subgroup of 5 patients contrasted CT was used. Beside normal radiological evaluation of lung tissue, perfusion conditions were evaluated by digital image processing in the lung volume automatically segmented. Results. Pulmonary lung evaluation showed that COVID-19 pneumonia almost completely regressed, with mild focal areas affected by fibrous stripes. In patients that reported dyspnea, lung CT showed complete resolution of interstitial changes. Quantification of lung perfusion condition by contrasted CT, showed that dyspnea in 3 patients was associated with areas of hypoperfusion, while in 2 patients not reporting dyspnea perfusion conditions were comparable to normal controls. Conclusions. Although we obtained preliminary data, this is the first report on quantitative evaluation of hypoperfused lung tissue detected in recovering COVID-19 patients. These results suggest the need to further investigate these patients and to redefine the role of CT evaluation for diagnostic purposes as well as for evaluation of potential treatments.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianluigi Patelli","author_inst":"Bolognini Hospital - ASST Bergamo Est"},{"author_name":"Silvia Paganoni","author_inst":"Bolognini Hospital - ASST Bergamo Est"},{"author_name":"Francesca Besana","author_inst":"Bolognini Hospital - ASST Bergamo Est"},{"author_name":"Mattia Ronzoni","author_inst":"D\/Vision Lab srl"},{"author_name":"Simone Manini","author_inst":"D\/Vision Lab srl"},{"author_name":"Andrea Remuzzi","author_inst":"University of Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Jan Vandenbroucke","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

Patients with severe COVID-19 infections and comorbidities are more prone to respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mechanical ventilator use and ultimately succumb to these complications. Little evidence exists of the prevalence of underlying lung comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and associated mortality. Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature including PubMed (Medline), Embase (Ovid), Google Scholar and Cochrane Library. The last date for our search was 29th April 2020. We included all original research articles on COVID-19 and calculated prevalence of chronic lung disease patients among COVID-19 patients using random effects model. Further we assessed for mortality rates among COVID-19 patients associated with these lung comorbidities. Results The authors identified 29 articles that reported prevalence of chronic lung conditions among COVID-19 patients. Among those, 26 were from China and 3 from the United States. The pooled prevalence of lung comorbidities including Asthma, COPD, and lung cancer was 3% (95% CI=0-14%), 2.2% (95% CI=0.02-0.03%) and 2.1% (95% CI=0.00-0.21%) respectively. Mortality rates associated with these comorbidities was 30% (41\/137) for COPD and 19% (7\/37) for lung cancer respectively. No mortality rates were reported for patients with asthma. Conclusion This study offers latest evidence of prevalence of chronic lung conditions among patients with COVID-19. Asthma, followed by COPD and lung cancer, was the most common lung comorbidity associated with COVID-19, while the higher mortality rate was found in COPD. Future studies are needed to assess other lung comorbidities and associated mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed G Alkhathami","author_inst":"Prince sultan military college for health sciences"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Advani","author_inst":"Georgetown University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adil A Abalkhail","author_inst":"Qassim University, Department of Human Health"},{"author_name":"Fahad M Alkhathami","author_inst":"Jazan University, Respiratory Care Department"},{"author_name":"Mohammed K AlShehri","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Respiratory Care Administration"},{"author_name":"Ebtisam Albeashy","author_inst":"Itqan Scientific Research Services Company"},{"author_name":"Jihad A Al Salamah","author_inst":"Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Respiratory Care Department"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

Several researchers have given the evidence of impacts of COVID-19 on the respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system. Studies still have debated on kidney injury of COVID-19 patients. The purpose of the meta-analysis was to evaluate the association of kidney impairment with the development of COVID-19. Methods: The PubMed, Embase and MedRxiv databases were searched until April 1, 2020. We extracted data from eligible studies to summarize the clinical manifestations and laboratory indexes of kidney injury on COVID-19 infection patients and further compared the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the mean differences of three biomarkers between in ICU\/severe and non-ICU\/non-severe cases. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method. Results: In the sum of 19 studies with 4375 patients were included in this analysis. The pooled prevalence of AKI, increased serum creatinine (Scr), increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased D-dimer, proteinuria and hematuria in patients with COVID-19 were 7.7%, 6.6%, 6.2%, 49.8%, 42% and 30.3% respectively. Moreover, the means of Scr, BUN and D-dimer were shown 6-folds, 1.8-folds and 0.68-folds, respectively, higher in ICU\/severe cases than in corresponding non-ICU\/non-severe patients. The prevalence of AKI was about 17 folds higher in ICU\/severe patients compared with the non-ICU\/non-severe cases. Conclusions: Overall, we assessed the incidences of the clinic and laboratory features of kidney injury in COVID-19 patients. And kidney dysfunction may be a risk factor for COVID-19 patients developing into the severe condition. In reverse, COVID-19 can also cause damage to the kidney.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qixin Yang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiyao Yang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Adil A Abalkhail","author_inst":"Qassim University, Department of Human Health"},{"author_name":"Fahad M Alkhathami","author_inst":"Jazan University, Respiratory Care Department"},{"author_name":"Mohammed K AlShehri","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Respiratory Care Administration"},{"author_name":"Ebtisam Albeashy","author_inst":"Itqan Scientific Research Services Company"},{"author_name":"Jihad A Al Salamah","author_inst":"Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Respiratory Care Department"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

One set of questions involves host genetic factors that may affect disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. New work is emerging related to SARS-CoV-2; previous work has been conducted on other coronaviruses that affect different species. Objectives: We aimed to review the literature on host genetic factors related to coronaviruses, with a systematic focus on human studies. Methods: We conducted a PubMed-based search and analysis for articles relevant to host genetic factors in coronavirus. We categorized articles, summarized themes related to animal studies, and extracted data from human studies for analyses. Results: We identified 1,187 articles of potential relevance. Forty-five studies were related to human host genetic factors related to coronavirus, of which 35 involved analysis of specific genes or loci; aside from one meta-analysis on respiratory infections, all were candidate-driven studies, typically investigating small number of research subjects and loci. Multiple significant loci were identified, including 16 related to susceptibility to coronavirus (of which 7 identified protective alleles), and 16 related to outcomes or clinical variables (of which 3 identified protective alleles). The types of cases and controls used varied considerably; four studies used traditional replication\/validation cohorts. Of the other studies, 28 involved both human and non-human host genetic factors related to coronavirus, 174 involved study of non-human (animal) host genetic factors related to coronavirus, 584 involved study of non-genetic host factors related to coronavirus, including involving immunopathogenesis, 16 involved study of other pathogens (not coronavirus), 321 involved other studies of coronavirus, and 18 studies were assigned to the other categories and removed. Key findings: We have outlined key genes and loci from animal and human host genetic studies that may bear investigation in the nascent host genetic factor studies of COVID-19. Previous human studies to date have been limited by issues that may be less impactful on current endeavors, including relatively low numbers of eligible participants and limited availability of advanced genomic methods.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marissa LoPresti","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"David B Beck","author_inst":"National Human Genome Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priya Duggal","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Derek A.T.

A key unknown in social distancing strategies is the duration of time for which such strategies are needed. Answering this question requires an accurate model of the transmission trajectory. A challenge in fitting such a model is the limited COVID-19 case data available from a given location. To overcome this challenge, we propose fitting a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission jointly across multiple locations. We apply the model to COVID-19 case data from Spain, UK, Germany, France, Denmark, and New York to estimate the distribution for the time needed for social distancing to end to range from May 2020 to July 2021 (95% credible interval), where the median date is October 2020.

Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science databases and grey literature for studies reporting epidemiological and clinical data of patients with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Eligible studies were all observational or interventional studies and commentaries in English language that reported patient data on HIV\/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. We used random effect meta-analysis to determine the pooled prevalence and mortality. Results: Of the 17 eligible studies, there were 3 retrospective cohorts, 1 survey, 5 case series, 7 case reports and 1 commentary that reported on a total of 146 HIV infected individuals. The pooled prevalence of HIV among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.0 - 3.0, I2 = 79.3%, p=0.01), whereas the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HIV patients was 0.68% (95% CI: 0.34 - 1.34). There were 110 (83.8%) HIV\/ SARS-CoV-2 co-infected males, and the age (range) of the co-infected was 30 - 60 years. A total of 129 (97.0%) were anti-retroviral therapy experienced, and 113 (85.6%) had a suppressed HIV viral load. The CD4 count (range) was 298 - 670 cells\/mm3 (n = 107). The commonest symptoms were fever (73.5%, n=75) and cough (57.8%, n = 59). Sixty-two (65.3%) patients had at least one other comorbid condition, of which hypertension (26.4%, n = 38) was the commonest. Chest radiological imaging abnormalities were found in 46 (54.1%) cases. Twenty-eight cases (56.0%) were reported as mild. Recovery occurred in 120 (88.9%) cases, and the pooled mortality was 9% (95% CI: 3.0 - 15.0, I2 = 25.6%, p =0.24). Conclusion: The prevalence of HIV\/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection was low. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of HIV\/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection are comparable to those reported among HIV negative SARS-CoV-2 cases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Baruch Baluku","author_inst":"Mulago National Referral Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ronald Olum","author_inst":"Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Curthbert Agolor","author_inst":"Mildmay Uganda"},{"author_name":"Josephine Nakakande","author_inst":"Mildmay Uganda"},{"author_name":"Laura Russell","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Felix Bongomin","author_inst":"Gulu University"},{"author_name":"Jane Nakaweesi","author_inst":"Mildmay Uganda"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

The combination of COVID-19 clinical data and genome sequence information is providing a potential route to such mechanisms. Here we took a candidate gene approach to UK Biobank data based on the suggested roles of endothelium and membrane proteins in COVID-19. We focussed on the PIEZO1 gene, which encodes a non-selective cation channel that mediates endothelial responses to blood flow. The analysis suggests 3 missense PIEZO1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COVID-19 fatality independently of risk factors. All of them affect amino acids in the proximal N-terminus of PIEZO1, which is an unexplored region of the protein. By using molecular modelling we predict location of all 3 amino acids to a common outward-facing structure of unknown functional significance at the tips of the PIEZO1 propeller blades. Through genome sequence analysis we show that these SNPs vary in prevalence with ethnicity and that the most significant SNP (rs7184427) varies between 65 to 90% even though the reference amino acid is evolutionarily conserved. The data suggest PIEZO1 as a contributor to COVID-19 fatality and factor in ethnic susceptibility.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chew W Cheng","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Vijayalakshmi Deivasikamani","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Melanie J Ludlow","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Dario De Vecchis","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Antreas C Kalli","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"David J Beech","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Piruthivi Sukumar","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

COVID-19 infection has led to an overwhelming effort by health institutions to meet the high demand for hospital admissions. Aim. To analyse the clinical variables associated with readmission of patients who had previously been discharged after admission for COVID-19. Design and methods. We studied a retrospective cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted and subsequently discharged alive. We then conducted a nested case-control study paired (1:1 ratio) by age, sex and period of admission. Results. Out of 1368 patients who were discharged during the study period, 61 patients (4.4%) were readmitted. Immunocompromised patients were at increased risk for readmission. There was also a trend towards a higher probability of readmission in hypertensive patients (p=0.07). Cases had had a shorter hospital stay and a higher prevalence of fever during the 48 hours prior to discharge. There were no significant differences in oxygen levels measured at admission and discharge by pulse oximetry intra-subject or between the groups. Neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio at hospital admission tended to be higher in cases than in controls (p=0.06). The motive for readmission in 10 patients (16.4%), was a thrombotic event in venous or arterial territory (p<0.001). Neither glucocorticoids nor anticoagulants prescribed at hospital discharge were associated with a lower readmission rate. Conclusions. The rate of readmission after discharge from hospital for COVID-19 was low. Immunocompromised patients and those presenting with fever during the 48 hours prior to discharge are at greater risk of readmission to hospital.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lina Marcela Parra","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"MIreia Cantero","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Morras","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Alberto Vallejo","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Itziar Diego","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Elena Jimenez-Tejero","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Elena Munez","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Angel Asensio","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Ana Fernandez-Cruz","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Antonio Ramos-Martinez","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

This presentation is consistent with cytokine release syndrome in chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, for which IL-6 blockade is approved treatment. Methods We assessed effectiveness and safety of IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab in a single-center cohort of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint was survival probability post-intubation; secondary analyses included an ordinal illness severity scale integrating superinfections. Outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab compared to tocilizumab-untreated controls were evaluated using multivariable Cox regression with propensity score inverse probability weighting (IPTW). Findings 154 patients were included, of whom 78 received tocilizumab and 76 did not. Median follow-up was 47 days (range 28-67). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, although tocilizumab-treated patients were younger (mean 55 vs. 60 years), less likely to have chronic pulmonary disease (10% vs. 28%), and had lower D-dimer values at time of intubation (median 2.4 vs. 6.5 mg\/dL). In IPTW-adjusted models, tocilizumab was associated with a 45% reduction in hazard of death [hazard ratio 0.55 (95% CI 0.33, 0.90)] and improved status on the ordinal outcome scale [odds ratio per 1-level increase: 0.59 (0.36, 0.95)]. Though tocilizumab was associated with an increased proportion of patients with superinfections (54% vs. 26%; p<0.001), there was no difference in 28-day case fatality rate among tocilizumab-treated patients with versus without superinfection [22% vs. 15%; p=0.42]. Interpretation In this cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, tocilizumab was associated with a decreased likelihood of death despite higher superinfection occurrence. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm these findings.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily C Somers","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Gregory A Eschenauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Troost","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan L Golob","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Tejal N Gandhi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Nina Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lindsay A Petty","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ji Hoon Baang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Nicholas O Dillman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David Frame","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kevin S Gregg","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Dan R Kaul","author_inst":"University of MIchigan"},{"author_name":"Jerod Nagel","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Twisha S Patel","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20116772","rel_title":"Characterizing and Forecasting Emergency Department Visits Related to COVID-19 Using Chief Complaints and Discharge Diagnoses","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20116772","rel_abs":"In response to the unprecedented public health challenge posed by the SARS CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) in the United States, we and our colleagues at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU\/APL) have developed a model of COVID-19 progression using emergency department (ED) visit data from the National Capital Region (NCR). We obtained ED visits counts through targeted queries of the NCR Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE). To focus on ED visits by COVID-19 patients, we adjusted the query results for typical ED visit volumes and for reductions in ED volumes due to COVID-19 precautions. With these ED visit data, we fitted a logistic growth model to characterize and forecast the increase in cumulative COVID-19 ED visits. Our model achieves the best fit when we assume that the first NCR visit occurred in early January. We estimate that approximately 15,000 COVID-19 ED visits occurred prior to May 2020 and that approximately 17,000 more visits will occur in subsequent months. We plan to deploy an operational pilot of this model in the NCR ESSENCE environment, assisting local public health authorities as they brace for a second wave of COVID-19. Additionally, we will iteratively assess potential model refinements, aiming to maximize the relevance of our model for the situational awareness and decision-making of local public health authorities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Phillip Koshute","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Rekha Holtry","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Richard Wojcik","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Wayne Loschen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sheri Lewis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Nina Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lindsay A Petty","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ji Hoon Baang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Nicholas O Dillman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David Frame","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kevin S Gregg","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Dan R Kaul","author_inst":"University of MIchigan"},{"author_name":"Jerod Nagel","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Twisha S Patel","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117945","rel_title":"COVID-SGIS: A smart tool for dynamic monitoring and temporal forecasting of Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117945","rel_abs":"Objective The new kind of coronavirus SARS-Cov2 spread to countries in all continents in the World. The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) causes fever, cough, sore throat, and in severe cases shortness of breath and death. To evaluate strategies, it is necessary to forecast the number of cases and deaths, in order to aid the stakeholders in the process of making decisions against the disease. We propose a system for real-time forecast of the cumulative cases of Covid-19 in Brazil. Study Design Monitoring of all Brazilian cities using oficial information from the National Notification System, from March to May 2020, concentrated on Brazil.io databases. Training and evaluation of ARIMA and other machine learning algorithms for temporal forecasting using correlation indexes (Pearson's, Spearman's, and Kendall's) and RMSE(%). Validation from the relative errors of the following six days. Methods Our developed software, COVID-SGIS, captures information from the 26 states and the Distrito Federal at the Brazil.io database. From these data, ARIMA models are created for the accumulation of confirmed cases and death cases by Covid-19. Finally, six-day forecasts graphs are available for Brazil and for each of its federative units, separately, with a 95% CI. In addition to these predictions, the worst and best scenarios are also presented. Results ARIMA models were generated for Brazil and its 27 federative units. The states of Bahia, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapa, Rondonia every day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The same happened to the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana and Santa Catarina. In Brazil, the percentage error between the predicted values and the actual values varied between 2.56% and 6.50%. For the days when the forecasts outside the prediction interval, the percentage errors in relation to the worst case scenario were below 5%. The states of Bahia, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapa, and Rondonia every day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The same happened to the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana and Santa Catarina. Conclusion The proposed method for dynamic forecasting may be used to guide social policies and plan direct interventions in a robust, flexible and fast way. Since it is based on information from multiple databases, it can be adapted to the different realities, becoming an important tool to guide the course of politics and action against Covid-19 pandemic worldwide.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clarisse Lins de Lima","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Cordeiro da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Ana Clara Gomes da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Luiz Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Souza Marques","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Lucas Job Brito de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Luiz Antonio Albuquerque Junior","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Samuel Barbosa Jatoba de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica de Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Anwar Musah","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Patty Kostkova","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Abel Guilhermino da Silva Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117770","rel_title":"COVID-19 apparent reproductive number dropped during Spain's nationwide dropdown, then spiked at lower-incidence regions","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117770","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread worldwide. Spain has suffered one of the largest nationwide bursts, particularly in the highly populated areas of Madrid and Barcelona (two of the five largest conurbations in Europe). We used segmented regression analyses to identify shifts in the evolution of the apparent reproductive number (Rt) reported for 16 Spanish administrative regions. We associate these breaking points with a timeline of key containment measures taken by national and regional governments, applying time lags for the time from contagion to case detection, with their associated errors. Results show an early decrease of Rt that preceded the nationwide lockdown; a generalized, sharp decrease in Rt associated with such lockdown; a low impact of the strengthened lockdown, with a flattening of Rt evolution in high-incidence regions regions - but increases in Rt at low-incidence regions; and an increase in Rt, associated to the relaxation of the lockdown measures, in ten regions. These results evidence the importance of generalized lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 spread; and the limited effect of the subsequent application of a stricter lockdown (restrictions to all non-essential economic activities). Most importantly, they highlight the importance of maintaining strong social distancing measures and strengthening public health control during lockdown de-escalation.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Santamaria","author_inst":"Donana Biological Station (EBD-CSIC)"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Hortal","author_inst":"Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (MNCN-CSIC)"},{"author_name":"Ana Clara Gomes da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Luiz Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Souza Marques","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Lucas Job Brito de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Luiz Antonio Albuquerque Junior","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Samuel Barbosa Jatoba de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica de Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Anwar Musah","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Patty Kostkova","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Abel Guilhermino da Silva Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117556","rel_title":"SIR-PID: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller for COVID-19 Outbreak Containment","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117556","rel_abs":"Ongoing social restrictions, as distancing and lockdown, adopted by many countries for contrasting the COVID-19 epidemic spread, try to find a trade-off between induced economic crisis, healthcare system collapse and costs in terms of human lives. Applying and removing restrictions on a system with uncontrollable inertia, as represented by an epidemic outbreak, may create critical instabilities, overshoots and strong oscillations of infected people around the desirable set-point, defined as the maximum number of hospitalizations acceptable by a given healthcare system. A good understanding of the system reaction to a change of the input control variable can be reasonably achieved using a proportional-integral-derivative controller, widely used in technological applications. In this paper we make use of this basic control theory for understanding the reaction of COVID-19 propagation to social restrictions and for exploiting a very known technology to reduce the epidemic damages through the correct tuning of the containment policy.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Rossi","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare"},{"author_name":"Aldo Ianni","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare"},{"author_name":"Ana Clara Gomes da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Luiz Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Souza Marques","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Lucas Job Brito de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Luiz Antonio Albuquerque Junior","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Samuel Barbosa Jatoba de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica de Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Anwar Musah","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Patty Kostkova","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Abel Guilhermino da Silva Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
