We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of various treatment modalities in nCOV-2019 patients. Methods: An extensive literature search was conducted before 22 May 2020 in PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane library databases. Quality assessment was performed using Newcastle Ottawa Scale. A fixed-effect model was applied if I2 <50%, else the results were combined using random-effect model. Risk Ratio (RR) or Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) along-with 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) were used to pool the results. Between study heterogeneity was explored using influence and sensitivity analyses & publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Entire statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2. Results: Eighty-one studies involving 44 in vitro and 37 clinical studies including 8662 nCOV-2019 patients were included in the review. Lopinavir-Ritonavir compared to controls was significantly associated with shorter mean time to clinical improvement (SMD -0.32; 95%CI -0.57 to -0.06) and Remdesivir compared to placebo was significantly associated with better overall clinical improvement (RR 1.17; 95%CI 1.07 to 1.29). Hydroxychloroquine was associated with less overall clinical improvement (RR 0.88; 95%CI 0.79 to 0.98) and longer time to clinical improvement (SMD 0.64; 95%CI 0.33 to 0.94). It additionally had higher all-cause mortality (RR 1.6; 95%CI 1.26 to 2.03) and more total adverse events (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.58 to 2.13). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that except in vitro studies, no treatment till now has shown clear-cut benefit on nCOV-2019 patients. Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Remdesivir have shown some benefits in terms less time to clinical improvement and better overall clinical improvement. Hydroxychloroquine use has a risk of higher mortality and adverse events. Results from upcoming large clinical trials must be awaited to draw any profound conclusions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shubham Misra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Manabesh Nath","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Vijay Hadda","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Deepti Vibha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20110239","rel_title":"In Vitro Efficacy of Povidone-Iodine Nasal And Oral Antiseptic Preparations Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20110239","rel_abs":"Introduction:Improved antisepsis of human and non-human surfaces has been identified as a key feature of transmission reduction. There are no previous studies of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2. This study evaluated nasal and oral antiseptic formulations of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) for virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2. This is the first report on the efficacy of PVP-I against the virus that causes COVID-19. Methods: PVP-I nasal antiseptic formulations and PVP-I oral rinse antiseptic formulations from 1-5% concentrations as well as controls were studied for virucidal efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Test compounds were evaluated for ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 as measured in a virucidal assay. SARS-CoV-2 was exposed directly to the test compound for 60 seconds, compounds were then neutralized and surviving virus was quantified. Results: All concentrations of nasal antiseptics and oral rinse antiseptics evaluated completely inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Conclusions: Nasal and oral PVP-I antiseptic solutions are effective at inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus at a variety of concentrations after 60s exposure times. The formulations tested may help to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 if used for nasal decontamination, oral decontamination or surface decontamination in known or suspected cases of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesse Pelletier","author_inst":"Ocean Ophthalmology Group (Miami, FL)"},{"author_name":"Belachew Tessema","author_inst":"ProHealth Physicians Ear, Nose and Throat (Farmington, CT),  University of Connecticut, Department of Otolaryngology (Farmington, CT)"},{"author_name":"Jonna Westover","author_inst":"The Institute for Antiviral Research at Utah State University (Logan, UT)"},{"author_name":"Samantha Frank","author_inst":"University of Connecticut, Department of Otolaryngology (Farmington, CT)"},{"author_name":"Seth Brown","author_inst":"University of Connecticut, Department of Otolaryngology (Farmington, CT) ,  The Institute for Antiviral Research at Utah State University (Logan, UT)"},{"author_name":"Joseph Capriotti","author_inst":"Veloce BioPharma (Fort Lauderdale, FL)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110544","rel_title":"IMPACT OF GLUCOCORTICOID TREATMENT IN SARS-COV-2 INFECTION MORTALITY: A RETROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED COHORT STUDY","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110544","rel_abs":"Objective: We aim to determine the impact of steroid use in COVID-19 pneumonia in-hospital mortality. Design: We performed a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Setting: A University hospital in Madrid, Spain, during March 2020. Participants: Patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Exposures: Patients treated with steroids were compared to patients not treated with steroids. A propensity-score for steroid treatment was developed. Different steroid regimens were also compared, and adjusted with a second propensity score. Main Outcomes and Measures: To determine the role of steroids in in-hospital mortality, univariable and multivariable analyses were performed, and adjusted including the propensity score as a covariate. Survival times were compared using a log-rank test. Results: During the study period, 463 out of 848 hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 396 (46.7%) consecutive patients were treated with steroids and 67 patients were assigned to the control cohort. Global mortality was 15.1%. Median time to steroid treatment from symptom onset was 10 days (IQR 8 to13). In-hospital mortality was lower in patients treated with steroids than in controls (13.9% [55\/396] versus 23.9% [16\/67], OR 0.51 [0.27 to 0.96], p= 0.044). Steroid treatment reduced mortality by 41.8% relative to no steroid treatment (RRR 0,42 [0.048 to 0.65). Initial treatment with 1 mg\/kg\/day of methylprednisolone (or equivalent) versus steroid pulses was not associated with in-hospital mortality (13.5% [42\/310] versus 15.1% [13\/86], OR 0.880 [0.449-1.726], p=0.710). Conclusions: Our results show that survival of patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia is higher in patients treated with glucocorticoids than in those not treated. In-hospital mortality was not different between initial regimens of 1 mg\/kg\/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent and glucocorticoid pulses. These results support the use of glucocorticoids in SARS-CoV2 infection.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Fernandez-Cruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Belen Ruiz-Antoran","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Ana Munoz-Gomez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Aranzazu Sancho-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Patricia Mills-Sanchez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Adolfo Centeno-Soto","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Silvia Blanco-Alonso","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Laura Javaloyes-Garachana","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Amy Galan-Gomez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Angela Valencia-Alijo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Javier Gomez-Irusta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Concepcion Payares-Herrera","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Morras-Torre","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Enrique Sanchez-Chica","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Laura Delgado-Tellez-de-Cepeda","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Callejas-Diaz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Antonio Ramos-Martinez","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Elena Munez-Rubio","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Cristina Avendano-Sola","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20110346","rel_title":"Investigating SARS-CoV-2 surface and air contamination in an acute healthcare setting during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in London","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20110346","rel_abs":"Objectives: To evaluate SARS-CoV-2 surface and air contamination during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in London. Design: Prospective cross-sectional observational study. Setting: An acute NHS healthcare provider. Participants: All inpatient wards were fully occupied by patients with COVID-19 at the time of sampling. Interventions: Air and surface samples were collected from a range of clinical areas and a public area of the hospital. An active air sampler was used to collect three or four 1.0 m3 air samples in each area. Surface samples were collected by swabbing approximately 25 cm2 of items in the immediate vicinity of each air sample. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-qPCR and viral culture using Vero E6 and Caco2 cells; additionally the limit of detection for culturing SARS-CoV-2 dried onto surfaces was determined. Main outcome measures: SARS-CoV-2 detected by PCR or culture. Results: Viral RNA was detected on 114\/218 (52.3%) of surface and 14\/31 (38.7%) air samples but no virus was cultured. The proportion of surface samples contaminated with viral RNA varied by item sampled and by clinical area. Viral RNA was detected on surfaces and in air in public areas of the hospital but was more likely to be found in areas immediately occupied by COVID-19 patients (67\/105 (63.8%) in areas immediately occupied by COVID-19 patients vs. 29\/64 (45.3%) in other areas (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.9, p=0.025, Fishers exact test). The PCR Ct value for all surface and air samples (>30) indicated a viral load that would not be culturable. Conclusions: Our findings of extensive viral RNA contamination of surfaces and air across a range of acute healthcare settings in the absence of cultured virus underlines the potential risk from surface and air contamination in managing COVID-19, and the need for effective use of PPE, social distancing, and hand\/surface hygiene.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Otter","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Richard Price","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Cristina Cimpeanu","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Danel Meno Garcia","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Piers Boshier","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Frances Bolt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alison H Holmes","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barklay","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Concepcion Payares-Herrera","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Morras-Torre","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Enrique Sanchez-Chica","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Laura Delgado-Tellez-de-Cepeda","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Callejas-Diaz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Antonio Ramos-Martinez","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Elena Munez-Rubio","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Cristina Avendano-Sola","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20111179","rel_title":"On the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indian State of Maharashtra: Forecasting & Effect of different parameters","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20111179","rel_abs":"This work details the outbreak and factors affecting the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Indian state of Maharashtra, which is considered as one of the most massive and deadly pandemic outbreaks.

Alternative do-it-yourself respirators (ADR) emerge, without any proof of protection. Objective Verify seal potential of two ADR compared to a common FFP2 respirator. Design Quality assessment pilot study. Setting Tertiary Care Hospital. Participants Ten anaesthesiology residents. Interventions Participants performed quantitative face-fit tests (QNFT) with three respirators to evaluate seal. A common FFP2 respirator was used as baseline (control group). ADR tested in this study are an Anaesthesia Face Mask (AFM) and a full-face Modified Snorkelling Mask (MSM) with a 3D-printed connector, both in conjunction with a breathing system filter. Main outcome measures Non-inferior seal performance of ADR over FFP2, assessed by calculated QNFT based on measured individual fit factors, as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Results For each respirator a total of 90 individual fit factor measurements were taken. Within the control group, seal failed in 37 (41%) measurements but only in 10 (11%) within the AFM group and in 6 (7%) within the MSM group (P < 0.001 respectively). However, when calculating the final, mean QNFT results, no statistically significant difference was found between respirators. Successful QNFT were determined for 5 out of 10 participants in the control group, for 8 in the AFM group (P = 0.25) and for 7 in the MSM group (P = 0.69). Conclusion Both ADR do have the potential to provide non inferior seal compared to a common FFP2 respirator. While AFM respirators are easily assembled, snorkelling masks must undergo significant but feasible modifications. Our results suggest that those ADR masks might be further investigated as they seem to be viable alternatives for situations when certified respirators are not available.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco Pettinger","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Mona Momeni","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Clemence Michaud","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Michel Van Dyck","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"David Kahn","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Lemaire","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Le Nguyen Truc Nhuc","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Han Ny","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Ngo Ngoc Quang Minh","author_inst":"CH1"},{"author_name":"Dinh Nguyen Huy Man","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Vu Thi Ty Hang","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Phan Nguyen Quoc Khanh","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Tran Chan Xuan","author_inst":"Cu Chi Hospital, HCMC"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Phong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Nguyen Hoang Tu","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Tinh Hien","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111666","rel_title":"Evaluation of the disinfecting capacity of ozone in emergency vehicles.","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111666","rel_abs":"Objective: As a consequence of the health crisis arising from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic, ozone treatments are being applied as disinfectant in emergency vehicles, without objective evidence on its efficacy.

Animal coronaviruses rarely infect humans with the exceptions of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and now SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many studies suggested that genetic variants in ACE2 gene may influence the host susceptibility\/resistance to SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the functional role of ACE2 in human pathophysiology. However, all these studies have been conducted in silico based on epidemiological and population data. We therefore investigated the occurrence of ACE2 variants in a cohort of 99 Italian unrelated individuals clinically diagnosed with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) to experimental demonstrate allelic association with disease severity. Methods: By whole-exome sequencing we analysed 99 DNA samples of severely and extremely severely COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata and Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome. Results: We identified three different germline variants, one intronic (c.439+4G>A) and two missense (c.2158A>G, p.Asn720Asp; c.1888G>C, p.Asp630His ), in 26 patients with a similar frequency between male and female and a not statistically different frequency, except for c.1888G>C, (p.Asp630His) with the ethnically matched populations (EUR). Conclusions: Our results suggest that there is not any ACE2 exonic allelic association with disease severity. It is possible that rare susceptibility alleles are located in the non-coding region of the gene able to control ACE2 gene activity. It is therefore of interest, to explore the existence of ACE2 susceptibility alleles to SARS-Co-V2 in these regulatory regions. In addition, we found no significant evidence that ACE2 alleles is associated with disease severity\/sex bias in the Italian population.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio Novelli","author_inst":"Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michela Biancolella","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Tor Vergata University of Rome, 00133 Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paola Borgiani","author_inst":"Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University of Rome, 00133 Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cocciadiferro","author_inst":"Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vito Luigi Colona","author_inst":"Medical Genetics Laboratory, Tor Vergata Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria D'Apice","author_inst":"Medical Genetics Laboratory, Tor Vergata Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paola Rogliani","author_inst":"Unit of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Zaffina","author_inst":"Occupational Medicine, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Leonardis","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Tor Vergata University Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campana","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, IRCCS Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Raponi","author_inst":"Medical Directorate, IRCCS Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sandro Grelli","author_inst":"Dept. of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Novelli","author_inst":"Tor Vergata University"},{"author_name":"Tran Nguyen Hoang Tu","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Tinh Hien","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20112938","rel_title":"What Can We Learn from the Time Evolution of COVID-19 Epidemic in Slovenia?","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20112938","rel_abs":"A recent work (DOI 10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093310) indicated that temporarily splitting larger populations into smaller groups can efficiently mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The fact that, soon afterwards, on May 15, 2020, the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper we investigate the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate kappa by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the kappa-value by ~15 % as compared to the much bearable state of social and economical life wherein (justifiable) wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced\/followed. Significantly for behavioral and social science, our analysis of the time dependence kappa = kappa(t) may reveal an interesting self-protection instinct of the population, which became manifest even before the official lockdown enforcement.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioan Baldea","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Michela Biancolella","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Tor Vergata University of Rome, 00133 Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paola Borgiani","author_inst":"Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University of Rome, 00133 Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cocciadiferro","author_inst":"Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vito Luigi Colona","author_inst":"Medical Genetics Laboratory, Tor Vergata Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria D'Apice","author_inst":"Medical Genetics Laboratory, Tor Vergata Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paola Rogliani","author_inst":"Unit of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Zaffina","author_inst":"Occupational Medicine, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Leonardis","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Tor Vergata University Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campana","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, IRCCS Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Raponi","author_inst":"Medical Directorate, IRCCS Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sandro Grelli","author_inst":"Dept. of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Novelli","author_inst":"Tor Vergata University"},{"author_name":"Tran Nguyen Hoang Tu","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Tinh Hien","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20111211","rel_title":"Are we #stayinghome to Flatten the Curve?","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20111211","rel_abs":"The recent spread of COVID-19 across the U.S. led to concerted efforts by states to \"flatten the curve\" through the adoption of stay-at-home mandates that encourage individuals to reduce travel and maintain social distance. Combining data on changes in travel activity with COVID-19 health outcomes and state policy adoption timing, we characterize nationwide changes in mobility patterns and isolate the portion attributable to statewide mandates. We find evidence of dramatic nationwide declines in mobility prior to adoption of any statewide mandates. Once states adopt a mandate, we estimate further mandate-induced declines between 2.1 and 7.0 percentage points across methods that account for states' differences in travel behavior prior to policy adoption. In addition, we investigate the effects of stay-at-home mandates on changes in COVID-19 health outcomes while controlling for pre-trends and observed pre-treatment mobility patterns. We estimate mandate-induced declines between 0.13 and 0.17 in deaths (5.6 to 6.0 in hospitalizations) per 100 thousand across methods. Across 43 adopting states, this represents 23,366-30,144 fewer deaths (and roughly one million averted hospitalizations) for the months of March and April - which indicates that death rates could have been 42-54% higher had states not adopted statewide policies. We further find evidence that changes in mobility patterns prior to adoption of statewide policies also played a role in reducing COVID-19 mortality and morbidity. Adding in averted deaths due to pre-mandate social distancing behavior, we estimate a total of 48-71,000 averted deaths from COVID-19 for the two-month period. Given that the actual COVID-19 death toll for March and April was 55,922, our estimates suggest that deaths would have been 1.86-2.27 times what they were absent any stay-at-home mandates during this period. These estimates represent a lower bound on the health impacts of stay-at-home policies, as they do not account for spillovers or undercounting of COVID-19 mortality. Our findings indicate that early behavior changes and later statewide policies reduced death rates and helped attenuate the negative consequences of COVID-19. Further, our findings of substantial reductions in mobility prior to state-level policies convey important policy implications for re-opening.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James Sears","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"J.

Using real-time epidemiological data from Chile, the nation in Latin America with the highest testing rate for COVID-19, we derive delay-adjusted severity estimates by age group as of May 18th, 2020. Methods We employed statistical methods and daily series of age-stratified COVID-19 cases and deaths reported in Chile to estimate the delay-adjusted case fatality rate across six age groups. Results Our most recent estimates of the time-delay adjusted case fatality rate are 0.08% (95% Credible Interval CrI:0.04-0.13%) among persons aged 0-39, 0.61% (95%CrI:0.41-0.87%) for those aged 40-49, 1.06% (95%CrI:0.76-1.40%) for those aged 50-59, 3.79% (95%CrI:3.04-4.66%) for those aged 60-69, 12.22% (95%CrI:10.40-14.38%) for those aged 70-79, and 26.27% (95%CrI:22.95-2980%) for persons aged 80 and over. The overall time-delay adjusted case fatality rate is1.78% (95%CrI: 1.63-1.95%) across all age groups. Conclusions Severity estimates from COVID-19 in Chile indicate a disproportionate impact among seniors, especially among those aged [&ge;] 70 years. COVID-19 is imposing a high death toll in Latin America. Case fatality rates in Chile suggest the health system is not yet overwhelmed, but the epidemic is expanding fast.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eduardo A Undurraga","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kenji Mizumoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Sofia B.

Understanding the effect of meteorological factors and control strategies on COVID-19 transmission is critical to contain the epidemic. Using individual-level data in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and the number of confirmed cases in other regions, we explore the effect of temperature, relative humidity, and control measures on the spread of COVID-19. We found that high temperature mitigates the transmission of the disease. High relative humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is high. Implementing classical control measures can dramatically slow the spread of the disease. However, due to the occurrence of pre-symptomatic infections, the effect of the measures to shorten onset-to-isolation time is markedly reduced and the importance of contact tracing and quarantine and social distancing increases.

Setting - Global setting including 45 countries from all six inhabited continents Population Two (2) or three (3) countries from each geographical region of the continents selected on the basis of population Main outcome - measures correlation factors derived from comparisons between different sets of variables Results - Empirical trends suggested in the existing literature were quantified in a global setting establishing clear trends. Correlation between the proportion of the population affected and median age, prime climate zones, malaria and tuberculosis incidence, BCG coverage and mitigation measures were established. Conclusions The study findings suggest that demographic and climatological factors, high endemicity of TB and Malaria, and universal BCG programmes may have a cushioning effect in the impact of Covid-19 on health systems of poorer and developing nations.

This combines multiple sources of data in a single model. The results show that Chelsea Mass.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the survival probability in a large subset of Latin-American adults with COVID-19 and our results contribute to achieving a better understanding of disease evolution.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Efren Murillo-Zamora","author_inst":"Mexican Institute of Social Security"},{"author_name":"CARLOS M HERNANDEZ-SUAREZ","author_inst":"UNIVERSIDAD DE COLIMA"},{"author_name":"Magda Osman","author_inst":"Queen Mary, University of London"},{"author_name":"Scott McLachlan","author_inst":"Queen Mary, University of London"},{"author_name":"Jiawen Hua","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Hang Hu","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Dehong Li","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Shan Yin","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Qian","author_inst":"Northwestern Polytechnical University"},{"author_name":"Peiling Chen","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Ningbo Yuan","author_inst":"Chang'an University"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Sun","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Novelli","author_inst":"Tor Vergata University"},{"author_name":"Tran Nguyen Hoang Tu","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Tinh Hien","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20112128","rel_title":"Estimation and monitoring of COVID-19 transmissibility from publicly available data","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20112128","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic began in the city of Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and quickly spread worldwide. The disease is caused by contact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which probably jumped from an animal host to humans. SARS-CoV-2 infects various tissues in the body, notably the lungs, and patients usually die from respiratory complications. Mathematical models of the disease have been instrumental to guide the implementation of mitigation strategies aimed at slowing the spread of the disease. One of the key parameters of mathematical models is the basic reproduction ratio R0, which measures the degree of infectivity of affected individuals. The goal of mitigation is to reduce R0 as close or below 1 as possible, as it means that new infections are in decline. In the present work, we use the recursive least-squares algorithm to establish the stochastic variability of a time-varying R0(t) from eight different countries: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, and the United States of America. The proposed system can be implemented as an online tracking application providing information about the dynamics of the pandemic to health officials and the public at large.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio da Silva Silveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pereira Jr.","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Magda Osman","author_inst":"Queen Mary, University of London"},{"author_name":"Scott McLachlan","author_inst":"Queen Mary, University of London"},{"author_name":"Jiawen Hua","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Hang Hu","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Dehong Li","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Shan Yin","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Qian","author_inst":"Northwestern Polytechnical University"},{"author_name":"Peiling Chen","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Ningbo Yuan","author_inst":"Chang'an University"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Sun","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Novelli","author_inst":"Tor Vergata University"},{"author_name":"Tran Nguyen Hoang Tu","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Tinh Hien","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20110965","rel_title":"Association of age, sex, comorbidities, and clinical symptoms with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 cases: a meta-analysis with 85 studies and 67299 cases","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20110965","rel_abs":"Background: A new pathogenic disease named COVID-19 became a global threat, first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

Methods: PubMed, Science Direct, SAGE were searched to collect data about demographic, clinical characteristics, and comorbidities of confirmed COVID-19 patients from January 1, 2020, to May 17, 2020. Meta-analysis was performed with the use of Review Manager 5.3 Results: Eighty-five studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 67,299 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Males are severely affected or died than females (OR = 2.26, p < 0.00001; OR = 3.59, p < 0.00001) are severely affected, or died by COVID-19 and cases with age [&ge;]50 are at higher risk of death than age <50 years (OR=334.23).

This data is updated every day and is available for most countries from multiple sources. In this work we present a two step procedure for model fitting to Covid-19 data. In the first step, time dependent transmission coefficients are constructed directly from the data and, in the second step, measures of those (minimum, maximum, mean, median etc.,) are used to set priors for fitting models to data. We call this approach a \"data driven approach\" or \"data first approach\". This scheme is complementary to Bayesian approach and can be used with or without that for parameter estimation. We use the procedure to fit a set of SIR and SIRD models, with time dependent contact rate, to Covid-19 data for a set of 45 most affected countries. We find that SIR and SIRD models with constant transmission coefficients cannot fit Covid-19 data for most countries (mainly because social distancing, lockdown etc., make those time dependent). We find that any time dependent contact rate, which falls gradually with time, can help to fit SIR and SIRD models for most of the countries. We also present constraints on transmission coefficients and basic reproduction number R0~ as well as effective reproduction number R(t). The main contributions of our work are as follows. (1) presenting a two step procedure for model fitting to Covid-19 data (2) constraining transmission coefficients as well as R0~ and R(t), for a set of most affected countries and (3) releasing a python package PyCov19 that can used to fit a set of compartmental models with time varying coefficients to Covid-19 data.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"JAYANTI PRASAD","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Md.

The reproductive number of COVID-19 provides an estimate on possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide the average reproductive number of COVID-19 based on available global level evidence. Methods We searched three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct) to find studies reported the reproductive number of COVID-19. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy that includes keywords of COVID-19 and its reproductive number related terms, which were combined using the Boolean operators. We used meta-analysis to provide average reproduction number of COVID-19. Results Total of 30 studies included in this review whereas 24 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The average estimated reproductive number was 2.70 (95% CI, 2.21-3.30). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive number reported in the included studies. The highest reproductive number was reported for Diamond Princes Cruise Ship, Japan (14.8). In the country-level, higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.98) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 5.08, 95% CI, 4.50-5.73). We also found estimation models, methods, and the number of cases considered to estimate reproductive number were played a role in arising the heterogeneity of the estimated reproductive number.

Studies with KAP and fear measures are limited only regional or country level, not yet with global or cross-cultural populations. The study is aimed to measure KAP and fear level towards COVID-19 and explore its cross-cultural variances in knowledge by socio-demographic factors among the general population of 8 different countries over 5 continents. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in April 2020 among 1296 participants using the Google form platform. Considering the social distancing formula and pandemic situation, we collect data using popular social media networks. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used to explore the collected data on KAP, fear, and sociodemographic factors. Result: Overall knowledge score was 9.7 (out of 12) and gender differences (female vs male: 9.8 vs 9.5) were significant (p=0.008) in the bivariate analysis. Knowledge score variances found significant in some regions by gender, marital status and education qualification. The highest and lowest mean knowledge scores were recorded in the Middle East (10.0) and Europe (9.3). Despite having a high fear score (22.5 out of 35), 78.35% of respondents were in a positive attitude and 81.7% in good practice level. Fear score rankings: Middle East (1st; 23.8), Europe (2nd; 23.2); Africa (3rd; 22.7); South Asia (4th; 22.1); Oceania (5th; 21.9); and North America (6th; 21.7). We did not find a correlation between fear and knowledge. Limitation: Due to the nature of the online survey, aged and rural populations are under-representing (e.g. more than half of the responders are 16-29 age group). Conclusion: KAP and fear variation exist among geographical regions. Gender, marital status and education qualification are factors in knowledge variances for some regions. KAP and fear measures can assist health education programs considering some sociodemographic factors and regions during an outbreak of highly contagious disease and, which can uplift a positive attitude and good practice.

At 20 ppm, an ozone concentration easily achieved by standard commercial equipment, the viruses were inactivated with high efficiency as long as the relative humidity was above a threshold value of approximately 50%.

We quantified excess mortality in regions of England and Wales during the pandemic, for all causes and for non-COVID-19 associated deaths. Methods Weekly mortality data for 1 Jan 2010 to 1 May 2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Mean-dispersion negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends and exponentiated linear predictions were subtracted from: i) all-cause deaths; and ii) all-cause deaths minus COVID-19 related deaths for the pandemic period (07-13 March to 25 April to 8 May). Findings Between 7 March and 8 May 2020, there were 47,243 (95%CI: 46,671 to 47,815) excess deaths in England and Wales, of which 9,948 (95%CI: 9,376 to 10,520) were not associated with COVID-19.

Data provided in this study supports the utility of a newly-designed lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. We employed a clinical cohort of 1,892 SARS-CoV-2 patients and controls, including individuals diagnosed by RT-qPCR at Yale New Haven Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Hefei City (Hefei CDC), Anhui Province (Anhui Province CDC), and Fuyang City (Fuyang CDC). The LFA studied here detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies with a specificity of 97.9-100% for IgM, 99.7-100% for IgG, and sensitivities ranging from 94.1-100% for patients >14-days post symptom onset. Sensitivity decreases in patients <14-days post symptom onset, which is likely due to lower IgG\/IgM antibody levels in this population. Finally, we developed a visual intensity reporting system that we believe will be suitable for laboratory and point-of-care settings, and will provide granular information about antibody levels. Overall our results support the widespread utility of this and other LFAs in assessing population-level epidemiological statistics.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Minteer","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Tao Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Department of Clinical Laboratory, Hefei 230032, China."},{"author_name":"David McDonald","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Linda Wang","author_inst":"Biohit Healthcare (Hefei) Co., Ltd, Hefei 230032, China."},{"author_name":"Si Hui Pan","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Caianiello","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jesse Collinski","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Immunology, New Haven, CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Edward deRamon","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Robert Hale","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Rebecca Howell","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jason Ray","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Joseph Vinetz","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Spiegel","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20111484","rel_title":"Estimation of the case fatality rate based on stratification for the COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20111484","rel_abs":"This work is motivated by the recent worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). When an epidemiological disease is prevalent, estimating the case fatality rate, the proportion of deaths out of the total cases, accurately and quickly is important as the case fatality rate is one of the crucial indicators of the risk of a disease. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator of the case fatality rate that provides more accurate estimate during an outbreak by reducing the downward bias (underestimation) of the naive CFR, the proportion of deaths out of confirmed cases at each time point, which is the most commonly used estimator due to the simplicity. The proposed estimator is designed to achieve the availability of real-time update by using the commonly reported quantities , the numbers of confirmed, cured, deceased cases, in the computation. To enhance the accuracy, the proposed estimator adapts a stratification, that allows the estimator to use information from heterogeneous strata separately. With the COVID-19 cases of China, South Korea and the United States, we numerically show the proposed stratification-based estimator plays a role of providing an early warning about the severity of a epidemiological disease that estimates the final case fatality rate accurately and shows faster convergence to the final case fatality rate.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Byungwon Kim","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Seonghong Kim","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Woncheol Jang","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Sungkyu Jung","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Johan Lim","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Si Hui Pan","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Caianiello","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jesse Collinski","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Immunology, New Haven, CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Edward deRamon","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Robert Hale","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Rebecca Howell","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jason Ray","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Joseph Vinetz","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Spiegel","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20111716","rel_title":"Psychological impact of Covid-19 lockdown in India: Different strokes for different folks","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20111716","rel_abs":"The psychological impact of the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic are widely documented. In India, a family-centric society with a high population density and extreme social stratification, the impact of the lockdown might vary across diverse social groups. However, the patterning in the psychological impact of the lockdown among sexual minorities and persons known to be at higher risk of contracting Covid-19 is not known in the Indian context. We used mixed methods (online survey, n=282 and in-depth interviews, n=14) to investigate whether the psychological impact of the lockdown was different across these groups of Indian adults. We fitted linear and logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Thematic analysis helped us identify emergent themes in our qualitative narratives. Anxiety was found to be higher among sexual minorities ({beta}=2.44, CI: 0.58, 4.31), high-risk group ({beta}=2.20, CI:0.36, 4.05), and those with history of depression\/loneliness ({beta}=3.89, CI:2.34, 5.44). Addiction to pornography was also found to be higher among sexual minorities ({beta}=2.72, CI: 0.09, 5.36). Qualitative findings suggested that sexual minorities likely used pornography and masturbation to cope with the lockdown, given the limited physical access to sexual partners in a society that stigmatizes homosexuality. Moreover, both qualitative and quantitative study findings suggested that greater frequency of calling family members during lockdown could strengthen social relationships and increase social empathy. The study thereby urgently calls for the attention of policymakers to take sensitive and inclusive health decisions for the marginalized and the vulnerable, both during and after the crisis.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anupam Joya Sharma","author_inst":"IIT Gandhinagar"},{"author_name":"Malavika Ambale Subramanyam","author_inst":"IIT Gandhinagar"},{"author_name":"Woncheol Jang","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Sungkyu Jung","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Johan Lim","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Si Hui Pan","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Caianiello","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jesse Collinski","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Immunology, New Haven, CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Edward deRamon","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Robert Hale","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Rebecca Howell","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jason Ray","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Joseph Vinetz","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Spiegel","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20104679","rel_title":"COVIDTrach; the outcomes of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy in the UK: Interim Report 22nd May 2020","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20104679","rel_abs":"COVIDTrach is a UK multidisciplinary collaborative project that aims to evaluate the outcomes of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. It also examines the implementation of national guidance in COVID-19 tracheostomies and the incidence of COVID-19 infections amongst those health care workers involved in the procedure. An invitation to participate in an online survey tool (REDCap) was disseminated to all UK NHS departments involved in tracheostomy in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients via the Federation of Surgical Specialty Associations, it's subsidiary organisations and the Intensive Care Society. To date 78 hospitals have submitted 564 COVID-19 tracheostomy cases. Fifty-two percent (n=219\/465) of patients who had undergone tracheostomy and were still alive, had been successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation at the point of completing the survey. The all cause in-hospital mortality following tracheostomy was 12% (n=62\/530), with 3% of these (n=2\/62) due to tracheostomy related complications and the remaining deaths due to COVID-19 related complications. Amongst 400 cases submitting data two weeks after the tracheostomy, no instance of COVID-19 infection amongst operators was recorded. FFP3 masks or Powered Air Purifying Respirators were used by operators in 100% of tracheostomies and a face visor or hood with face shield was available in 99% of cases. This interim report highlights early outcomes following tracheostomy in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients.

For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lock-downsin cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. It is crucial but hard to know how and when to take which level of interventions tailored to the specific situation in each country. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly accessing the effect of multiple interventions to control the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts in the UK and other European countries, accounting for balance of healthcare demand. Methods We developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild, moderate and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with date on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London and non-London regions in the UK during February 2020 and April 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. We applied the calibrated model to the prediction of infection and healthcare resource changes in other 6 European countries based on actual measures they have implemented during this period. Findings We estimated given that 1) By the date (5th March 2020) of the first report death in the UK, around 7499 people would have already been infected with the virus. After taking suppression on 23rd March, the peak of infection in the UK would have occurred between 28th March and 4th April 2020; the peak of death would have occurred between 18th April and 24th April 2020. 2) By 29th April, no significant collapse of health system in the UK have occurred, where there have been sufficient hospital beds for severe and critical cases. But in the Europe, Italy, Spain and France have experienced a 3 weeks period of shortage of hospital beds for severe and critical cases, leading to many deaths outside hospitals. 3) One optimal strategy to control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK is to take region-level specific intervention. If taking suppression with very high intensity in London from 23rd March 2020 for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in non-London regions. The total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 9.3 million and 143 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 96th day (12th May, 2020), where it needs hospital beds for 68.9 thousand severe and critical cases. 4) If taking a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 10 million and 154 thousand; the peak time of healthcare occurs at the 97th day (13th May, 2020), where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 73.5 thousand. 5) If too early releasing intervention intensity above moderate level and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, there would be a risk of second wave, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 23.4 million and 897 thousand. Interpretation: Considering social and economic costs in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, long-term suppression is not economically viable. Our finding suggests that rolling intervention is an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK and potential other countries for balancing healthcare demand and morality ratio. As for huge difference of population density and social distancing between different regions in the UK, it is more appropriate to implement regional level specific intervention with varied intensities and maintenance periods. We suggest an intervention strategy to the UK that take a consistent suppression in London for 100 days and 3 weeks rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would reduce the overall infections and deaths of COVID-19 outbreaks, and balance healthcare demand in the UK.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Po Yang","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jun Qi","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Shuhao Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"gaoshan Bi","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Xulong Wang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Bin Sheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xuxin Mao","author_inst":"National Institute of Economic and Social Research"},{"author_name":"Edward deRamon","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Robert Hale","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Rebecca Howell","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jason Ray","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Joseph Vinetz","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Spiegel","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
