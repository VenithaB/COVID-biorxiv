Understanding the potential sources of bias and methods to alleviate biases in these studies is important for informing their design and analysis. Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serologic studies in the context of an uncontrolled or a controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytic approaches to analyze the simulated data. We find that in studies assessing the efficacy of serostatus on future infection, comparing seropositive individuals to seronegative individuals with similar time-dependent patterns of exposure to infection, by stratifying or matching on geographic location and time of enrollment, is essential to prevent bias.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Kahn","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Models based on these acquired data may suffer from systematic errors and large estimation variances due to the biases associated with testing and lags between the infection and death counts. Here, we present an augmented compartment model to predict epidemic dynamics while explicitly modeling for the sampling bias involved in testing. Our simulations show that sampling biases in favor of patients with higher disease manifestation could significantly affect direct estimates of infection and fatality rates calculated from the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, and serological testing can partially mitigate these biased estimates. We further recommend a strategy to obtain unbiased estimates, calculating the dependence of expected confidence on a randomized sample size, showing that relatively small sample sizes can provide statistically significant estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related death rates.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yasir Suhail","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Junaid Afzal","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kshitiz","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Lindsley","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mary Hayden","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087882","rel_title":"Benchmarking the CoVID-19 pandemic across countries and states in the U.S.A. under heterogeneous testing","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087882","rel_abs":"Public health officials need to make urgent decisions to reduce the potential impact of the CoVID-19 pandemic. Benchmarking based on the increase in total cases or case fatality rates is one way of comparing performance across countries or territories (such as states in the USA), and could inform policy decisions about COVID-19 mitigation strategies. But comparing cases and fatality across territories is challenging due to heterogeneity in testing and health systems. We show two complementary ways of benchmarking across countries or US states. First, we used multivariate regressions to estimate the test-elasticity-of-COVID-19-case-incidence. We found a 10% increase in testing yielded ~9% (95% CI:4.2-13.4%; p<0.001) increase in reported cases across countries, and ~2% (95%CI:0.1-3.4%; p=0.03) increase across US states during the week ending April 10th, 2020. We found comparable negative elasticities for fatality rates (across countries: beta;=-0.77, 95%CI:-1.40- -0.14; p=0.02; US states: beta;=-0.15, 95%CI:-0.30-0.01; p=0.06). Our results were robust to various model specifications. Second, we decomposed the growth in cases into test growth and positive test ratio (PTR) growth to intuitively visualize the components of case growth. We hope these results can help support evidence-based decisions by public health officials as more consistent data hopefully becomes available.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenzo Asahi","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Eduardo A.

Minimizing human and socioeconomic costs of SARS-CoV-2 and future global pandemics requires data-driven and context-specific integrative modeling of detection-tracing, healthcare, and non-pharmaceutical interventions for decision-processes and reopening strategies. Traditional population-based epidemiological models cannot simulate temporal infection dynamics for individual human behavior in specific geolocations. We present an integrated geolocalized and demographically referenced spatio-temporal stochastic network- and agent-based model of COVID-19 dynamics for human encounters in real-world communities. Simulating intervention scenarios, we quantify effects of protection and identify the importance of early introduction of test-trace measures. Critically, we observe bimodality in SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics so that the outcome of reopening can flip between good and poor outcomes stochastically. Furthermore, intervention effectiveness depends on strict execution and temporal control i.e. leaks can prevent successful outcomes. Schools are in many scenarios hubs for transmission, reopening scenarios are impacted by infection chain stochasticity and subsequent outbreaks do not always occur. This generalizable geospatial and individualized methodology is unique in precision and specificity compared to prior COVID-19 models [6, 16, 17, 19] and is applicable to scientifically guided decision processes for communities world-wide.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bjoern Goldenbogen","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Stephan O.

Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, we modeled the temporal trends in daily new cases and deaths of COVID-19, and COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers (Rt) in the United States between March 1 and April 20, 2020, and conducted simulation studies. Results: The number and proportion of U.S. residents under SAHO increased between March 19 and April 7, and plateaued at 29,0829,980 and 88.6%, respectively. Trends in COVID-19 daily cases and Rt reduced after March 23 (P<0.001) and further reduced on April 3 (P<0.001), which was associated with implementation of SAHO by 10 states on March 23, and face-masking recommendation on April 3, respectively. The estimates of Rt eventually fell below\/around 1.0 on April 13. Similar turning points were identified in the trends of daily deaths with a lag time. Early implementation and early-removal of SAHO would be associated with significantly reduced and increased daily new cases and deaths, respectively.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Ninth Hospital, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Sabiha Hussain","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Guanzhu Lu","author_inst":"Shanghai Ninth Hospital, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kai Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Informatics, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA"},{"author_name":"Shi Wei","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL"},{"author_name":"Wei Bao","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Lanjing Zhang","author_inst":"Princeton Medical Center\/Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Johanna E L Haffner","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maria Krantz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maxim Karnetzki","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Ivo Maintz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Lisa Mallis","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rafael U Moran Torres","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Hannah Prawitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Patrick Segelitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Seeger","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rune Linding","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Edda Klipp","author_inst":"Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088591","rel_title":"Predictive mathematical models for the number of individuals infected with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088591","rel_abs":"We model the time-evolution of the number N(t) of individuals reported to be infected in a given country with a specific virus, in terms of a Riccati equation. Although this equation is nonlinear and it contains time-dependent coefficients, it can be solved in closed form, yielding an expression for N(t) that depends on a function (t). For the particular case that (t) is constant, this expression reduces to the well-known logistic formula, giving rise to a sigmoidal curve suitable for modelling usual epidemics. However, for the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, the long series of available data shows that the use of this simple formula for predictions underestimates N(t); thus, the logistic formula only provides a lower bound of N(t). After experimenting with more than 50 different forms of (t), we introduce two novel models that will be referred to as 'rational' and 'birational'. The parameters specifying these models (as well as those of the logistic model), are determined from the available data using an error-minimizing algorithm. The analysis of the applicability of the above models to the cases of China and South Korea suggest that they yield more accurate predictions, and importantly that they may provide an upper bound of the actual N(t).

We address this challenge by refocusing the full synthetic biology stack available at the London Biofoundry onto the development of alternative patient sample testing pipelines. We present a reagent-agnostic automated SARS-CoV-2 testing platform that can be quickly deployed and scaled, and that accepts a diverse range of reagents. Using an in-house-generated, open-source, MS2-virus-like-particle-SARS-CoV-2 standard, we validate RNA extraction and RT-qPCR workflows as well as two novel detection assays based on CRISPR-Cas and Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP) approaches. In collaboration with an NHS diagnostic testing lab, we report the performance of the overall workflow and benchmark SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples via RT-qPCR, CRISPR-Cas, and LAMP against clinical test sets. The validated RNA extraction and RT-qPCR platform has been installed in NHS diagnostic labs with a testing capacity of 1000 samples per day and now contributes to increased patient sample processing in the UK while we continue to refine and develop novel high-throughput diagnostic methods. Finally, our workflows and protocols can be quickly implemented and adapted by members of the Global Biofoundry Alliance and the wider scientific and medical diagnostics community.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael A Crone","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Miles Priestman","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marta Ciechonska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Jensen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"David J Sharp","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Marko Storch","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Freemont","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Maria Krantz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maxim Karnetzki","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Ivo Maintz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Lisa Mallis","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rafael U Moran Torres","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Hannah Prawitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Patrick Segelitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Seeger","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rune Linding","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Edda Klipp","author_inst":"Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20088146","rel_title":"Pooling RT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 for large cohort of 'healthy' and infection-suspected patients: A prospective and consecutive study on 1,000 individuals","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20088146","rel_abs":"Background SARS-CoV-2 testing reagents are expected to become in short supply worldwide.

Here we explore the effectiveness of political interventions using the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Europe. We propose a dynamic SEIR epidemiology model with a time-varying reproduction number, which we identify using machine learning. During the early outbreak, the basic reproduction number was 4.22+\/-1.69, with maximum values of 6.33 and 5.88 in Germany and the Netherlands.

We sought to determine whether Internet search patterns can be useful for tracking COVID-19 spread, and whether these data could also be useful in understanding the clinical progression of the disease in 32 countries across six continents. Temporal correlation analyses were conducted to characterize the relationships between a range of COVID-19 symptom-specific search terms and reported COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country during the period of January 1 through April 20, 2020. Increases in COVID-19 symptom-related searches preceded increases in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths by an average of 18.53 days (95% confidence interval 15.98 to 21.08) and 22.16 days (20.33 to 23.99), respectively. Cross-country ensemble averaging was used to derive average temporal profiles for each search term, which were combined to create a search-data-based view of the clinical course of disease progression. Internet search patterns revealed a clear temporal pattern of disease progression for COVID-19: Initial symptoms of fever, dry cough, sore throat and chills were followed by shortness of breath an average of 5.22 days (95% confidence interval 3.30 to 7.14) after initial symptom onset, matching the clinical course reported in the medical literature. This is the first study to show that Internet search data can be useful for characterizing the detailed clinical course of a disease. These data are available in real-time and at population scale, providing important benefits as a complementary resource for tracking the spread of pandemics, especially during the early stages before widespread laboratory testing is available.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tina Lu","author_inst":"Harvard  University"},{"author_name":"Ben Y Reis","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yuki Nagakubo","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuhiro Hosaka","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenji Amemiya","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hitomi Sueki","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miyoko Hayakawa","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Mochizuki","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Masao Omata","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ivo Maintz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Lisa Mallis","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rafael U Moran Torres","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Hannah Prawitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Patrick Segelitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Seeger","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rune Linding","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Edda Klipp","author_inst":"Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088385","rel_title":"The epidemiologic parameters for COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088385","rel_abs":"Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency and international concern and recognized it as a pandemic. The aim of this study was to estimate the epidemiologic parameters of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic for clinical and epidemiological help. Methods: Four electronic databases including Web of Science, Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Google Scholar were searched for literature published from early December 2019 up to 23 March 2020. The \"metan\" command was used to perform a fixed or random effects analysis. Cumulative meta-analysis was performed using the \"metacum\" command. Results: Totally 76 observational studies were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate for R0 was 2.99 (95% CI: 2.71-3.27) for COVID-19. The overall R0 was 3.23, 1.19, 3.6 and 2.35 for China, Singapore, Iran and Japan, respectively. The overall Serial Interval, doubling time, incubation period were 4.45, 4.14 and 4.24 days for COVID-19. In addition, the overall estimation for growth rate and case fatality rate for COVID-19 were 0.38% and 3.29%, respectively. Conclusion: Calculating the pooled estimate of the epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 as an emerging disease, could reveal epidemiological features of the disease that consequently pave the way for health policy makers to think more about control strategies.

In this study, we describe the in vitro testing of CPZ against a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in monkey and human cells. We evidenced an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of [~]10M. Because of its high biodistribution in lung, saliva and brain, such IC50 measured in vitro may translate to CPZ dosage used in clinical routine. This extrapolation is in line with our observations of a higher prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections among health care professionals compared to patients in psychiatric wards. These preclinical findings support the repurposing of CPZ, a largely used drug with mild side effects, in COVID-19 treatment.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marion Plaze","author_inst":"GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"David Attali","author_inst":"GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Prot","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Anne-Cecile Petit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Michael Blatzer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Fabien Vinckier","author_inst":"GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Laurine Levillayer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Florent Perin-Dureau","author_inst":"Fondation Rotschild"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Cachia","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Gerard Friedlander","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Chretien","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Etienne Simon-Loriere","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Raphael Gaillard","author_inst":"GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Hannah Prawitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Patrick Segelitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Seeger","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rune Linding","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Edda Klipp","author_inst":"Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.080119","rel_title":"Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions shaped the early outbreak in Central Eastern Europe: comparing Hungarian data to a worldwide sequence data-matrix","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.080119","rel_abs":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is the third highly pathogenic human coronavirus in history.

The causal coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds host cells via a trimeric Spike whose receptor binding domain (RBD) recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), initiating conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. We find that monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds the RBD tightly, neutralising SARS-CoV-2 and report the crystal structure at 2.4 [A] of the Fab\/RBD complex. Some crystals are suitable for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors. The highly conserved, structure-stabilising, CR3022 epitope is inaccessible in the prefusion Spike, suggesting that CR3022 binding would facilitate conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state. Cryo-EM analysis confirms that incubation of Spike with CR3022 Fab leads to destruction of the prefusion trimer. Presentation of this cryptic epitope in an RBD-based vaccine might advantageously focus immune responses.

Here, we provide preliminary data on stem cell based innate defense against a mouse model of coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) infection. In a mouse model of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) mediated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) dormancy, MHV-1 infection in the lung exhibited 20 fold lower viral loads than the healthy control mice, suggesting the potential enhancement of an anti-MHV-1 defense by Mtb. This defense mechanism involves the in vivo expansion and reprogramming of CD271+MSCs in the lung to an enhanced stemness phenotype. The reprogrammed MSCs facilitate the activation of stemness genes, intracellular Mtb replication, and extracellular release of Mtb. The conditioned media of the reprogrammed MSCs exhibit direct anti-viral activity in an in vitro model of MHV-1 induced toxicity to type II alveolar epithelial cells. Thus, our data suggest that reprogrammed MSCs exert a unique innate defense against MHV-1 by activating dormant Mtb. The molecular details of this anti-viral defense mechanism against coronavirus could be further studied to develop a vaccine against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lekhika Pathak","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Sukanya Gayan","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Bidisha Pal","author_inst":"Thoreau Laboratory for Global Health, M2D2, University of Massachusetts, Lowell"},{"author_name":"Joyeeta Talukdar","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Seema Bhuyan","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Sorra Sandhya","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Herman Yeger","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto"},{"author_name":"Debabrat Baishya","author_inst":"Gauhati University, Assam, India"},{"author_name":"Bikul Das","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Pranav NM Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Naomi Coombes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bewley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford and Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England and University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford and The Rosalind Franklin Institute"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.079939","rel_title":"Identification of novel mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of SARS-CoV-2 and their implications","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.079939","rel_abs":"The rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 mediated COVID-19 pandemic has been the cause of significant health concern, highlighting the immediate need for the effective antivirals. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has an inherent high mutation rate. These mutations drive viral evolution and genome variability, thereby, facilitating viruses to have rapid antigenic shifting to evade host immunity and to develop drug resistance. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) perform viral genome duplication and RNA synthesis. Therefore, we compared the available RdRp sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian isolates and  Wuhan wet sea food market virus sequence to identify, if any, variation between them. We report seven mutations observed in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and three unique mutations that showed changes in the secondary structure of the RdRp protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that these mutations alter the stability of RdRp protein. Therefore, we propose that RdRp mutations in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates might have functional consequences that can interfere with RdRp targeting pharmacological agents.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gyanendra Bahadur Chand","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Patna University, Patna-800005, Bihar, India"},{"author_name":"Atanu Banerjee","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Samastipur College, Samastipur- 848134, Bihar, India"},{"author_name":"Gajendra Kumar Azad","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Patna University, Patna-800005, Bihar, India"},{"author_name":"Joyeeta Talukdar","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Seema Bhuyan","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Sorra Sandhya","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Herman Yeger","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto"},{"author_name":"Debabrat Baishya","author_inst":"Gauhati University, Assam, India"},{"author_name":"Bikul Das","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Pranav NM Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Naomi Coombes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bewley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford and Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England and University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford and The Rosalind Franklin Institute"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.079061","rel_title":"Unsupervised cluster analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reflects its geographic progression and identifies distinct genetic subgroups of SARS-CoV-2 virus","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.079061","rel_abs":"Over 10,000 viral genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been made readily available during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic since the initial genome sequence of the virus was released on the open access Virological website (http:\/\/virological.org\/) early on January 11.

We analyze data on the nucleotide sequencing of the virus and geographic information of a subset of 7, 640 SARS-CoV-2 patients without missing entries that are available in the GISAID database. Instead of modelling the mutation rate, applying phylogenetic tree approaches, etc., we here utilize a model-free clustering approach that compares the viruses at a genome-wide level. We apply principal component analysis to a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of these SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences at all loci simultaneously, using the Jaccard index (Jaccard, 1901; Tan et al., 2005; Prokopenko et al., 2016; Schlauch et al., 2017). Our analysis results of the SARS-CoV-2 genome data illustrates the geographic and chronological progression of the virus, starting from the first cases that were observed in China to the current wave of cases in Europe and North America. We also observe that, based on their sequence data, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses cluster in distinct genetic subgroups.

As low-molecular-weight drugs have high potential to completely match interactions with essential SARS-CoV-2 targets, we propose a strategy to identify such drugs using the fragment-based approach. Herein, using ligand- and protein-observed fragment screening approaches, we identified niacin and hit 1 binding to the catalytic pocket of the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), thereby modestly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of Mpro. Chemical shift perturbations induced by niacin and hit 1 indicate a partial overlap of their binding sites, i.e., the catalytic pocket of Mpro may accommodate derivatives with large molecular sizes. Therefore, we searched for drugs containing niacin or hit 1 pharmacophores and identified carmofur, bendamustine, triclabendazole, and emedastine; these drugs are highly capable of inhibiting protease activity. Our study demonstrates that the fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for identifying low-molecular-weight drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 and other potential targets lacking specific drugs.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Gao","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Liu","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Fudong Li","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Rongsheng Ma","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Zhongliang Zhu","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Zhang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Jihui Wu","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yunyu Shi","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yueyin Pan","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yushu Ge","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Ke Ruan","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Naomi Coombes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bewley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford and Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England and University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford and The Rosalind Franklin Institute"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.079087","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias downregulates host expressed genes with similar codon usage","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.079087","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome is quickly spreading throughout the world and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Our analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 preferred codons have poor representation of G or C nucleotides in the third position, a characteristic which could conduct to an unbalance in the tRNAs pools of the infected cells with serious implications in host protein synthesis. By integrating this observation with proteomic data from infected cells, we observe a reduced translation rate of host proteins associated with highly expressed genes, and that they share the codon usage bias of the virus. The functional analysis of these genes suggests that this mechanism of epistasis contributes to understand some deleterious collateral effect as result of the viral replication.

Population-based serosurveys provide one avenue for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic, overcoming many of these limitations. Methods: Taking advantage of a pool of adult participants from population-representative surveys conducted in Geneva, Switzerland, we implemented a study consisting of 8 weekly serosurveys among these participants and their household members older than 5 years. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany). We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. Results: In the first three weeks, we enrolled 1335 participants coming from 633 households, with 16% <20 years of age and 53.6% female, a distribution similar to that of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 3.1% (95% CI 0.2-5.99, n=343). This increased to 6.1% (95% CI 2.6-9.33, n=416) in the second, and to 9.7% (95% CI 6.1-13.11, n=576) in the third week. We found that 5-19 year-olds (6.0%, 95% CI 2.3-10.2%) had similar seroprevalence to 20-49 year olds (8.5%, 95%CI 4.99-11.7), while significantly lower seroprevalence was observed among those 50 and older (3.7%, 95% CI 0.99-6.0, p=0.0008). Interpretation: Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is at least in the short-term associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from burning out simply due to herd immunity. Further, no differences in seroprevalence between children and middle age adults are observed. These results must be considered as Switzerland and the world look towards easing restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland; Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; University Centre fo"},{"author_name":"Ania Wisniak","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Piumatti","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Lauer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Helene Baysson","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"David De Ridder","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Dusan Petrovic","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Schrempft","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Kailing Marcus","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Arm-Vernez","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sabine Yerly","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Olivia Keiser","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Samia Hurst","author_inst":"Institut Ethique, Histoire, Humanites, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086397","rel_title":"THE PATHOGENESIS OF THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE IN COVID-19 PATIENTS: COULD BE A CATASTROPHIC ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME?","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086397","rel_abs":"Background The most severely COVID-19 patients need intensive care and show increased risk of thromboembolic events. Although some patients meet the diagnostic criteria for the Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, the pathogenesis of the diffuse thrombotic status remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in sera of deceased patients with autoptic proven thrombotic microangiopathy to evaluate if some patients may have developed Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS). Methods Thirty-five patients were enrolled. The available medical history, comorbidities, therapies, laboratory and autopsy findings were collected post-mortem from clinical records. IgA, IgG and IgM anti cardiolipin (ACA) and anti {beta}2 glycoprotein 1 ({beta}2GP1) antibodies, IgG and IgM anti phosphatidylserine\/prothrombin (PS\/PT) antibodies were tested for all the patients. Results 3\/35 (8.6%) patients were slightly positive for aPL: one for ACA IgG and two for ACA IgM but values were low (< 3X the cut off). No patients tested positive for ACA IgA neither for {beta}2GP1 isotypes. 3\/35 (8.6%) patients were positive for PS\/PT, one for IgG and two for IgM, but values were less than 2X the cut off. No patients showed simultaneous positivity for ACA and PS\/ PT. Conclusions It is difficult to categorize the vascular events into a conventional disease: we did not find significant association with anti-phospholipid antibodies. It is most likely that several factors contribute to trigger the hypercoagulability status and the thromboembolism but, on the basis our results, CAPS is probably not involved into the pathogenesis of these phenomena.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giulia Previtali","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michela Seghezzi","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Valentina Moioli","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Aurelio Sonzogni","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Pathological Anatomy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Marozzi","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cerutti","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Rudi Ravasio","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Andrea Gianatti","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Pathological Anatomy"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Guerra","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Maria Grazia Alessio","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Arm-Vernez","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sabine Yerly","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Olivia Keiser","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Samia Hurst","author_inst":"Institut Ethique, Histoire, Humanites, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088666","rel_title":"Urine Proteome of COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088666","rel_abs":"The atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing pandemic and a serious threat to global public health. The COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms account for a majority of mortality of this disease. However, early detection and effective prediction of patients with mild to severe symptoms remains challenging. In this study, we performed proteomic profiling of urine samples from 32 healthy control individuals and 6 COVID-19 positive patients (3 mild and 3 severe). We found that urine proteome samples from the mild and severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities can be clearly differentiated from healthy proteome samples based on the clustering analysis. Multiple pathways have been compromised after the COVID-19 infection, including the dysregulation of immune response, complement activation, platelet degranulation, lipoprotein metabolic process and response to hypoxia. We further validated our finding by directly comparing the same patients' urine proteome after recovery. This study demonstrates the COVID-19 pathophysiology related molecular alterations could be detected in the urine and the potential application of urinary proteome in auxiliary diagnosis, severity determination and therapy development of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yanchang Li","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Yihao Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Huiying Liu","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Sun","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Baoqing Ding","author_inst":"Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Yinghua Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Peiru Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Li Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhaodi Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Naikang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Lei Chang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Hengliang Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Changqing Bai","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089417","rel_title":"First Data-Set on SARS-CoV-2 Detection for Istanbul Wastewaters in Turkey","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089417","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and became a global pandemic [1]. By 26 April 2020, more than 2.9 million people were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and over 203 thousand people lost their life globally. By 26 April 2020, 107773 confirmed cases were reported in Turkey with 2706 deaths. Majority of the cases in Turkey has been observed in Istanbul. In the world, the duration of availability of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples [2]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewaters in Australia [3], Netherlands [4], USA [5], France [6], Spain [7] and USA [8] by using different virus concentration techniques. In this work, Istanbul metropole with 65 % of Covid-19 cases was chosen as the pilot city. On the 21st of April 2020, 24-hr composite samples were collected from the Ambarli, Pasakoy and Kadikoy wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). On the 25th of April 2020, more wastewater samples were taken from Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs. These wastewater treatment plants were selected among 81 plants in Istanbul in order to take representative samples from 4 different districts of Istanbul according to the severity of Covid-19 cases, like very serious, serious, moderate and mild. Grab samples were also collected from Bagcilar and Kartal manholes located nearby the pandemic hospitals on April 21st, 2020. Polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) adsorption [5] SARS-Cov-2 concentration method was used for SARS-CoV-2 concentration after optimization. Real time RT-PCR diagnostic panel validated by US was used to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw sewage taken from the inlets of treatment plants and manholes. Five samples out of seven from wastewater and all samples from manholes were tested positive. SARS-CoV-2 in raw sewage from Ambarli, Pasakoy, Kadikoy, Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs were found as 8.26x103, 1.80x104, ND, ND, 3.73x103, 4.95x103, 2.89x103, respectively. The Bagcilar and Kartal manholes nearby pandemic hospitals exhibited 4.49x104 and 9.33x104, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 virus titers of manhole were higher than those of inlet of WWTPs. The observed copy numbers were presented against the number of Covid-19 cases coming to the WWTP per treatment plant capacity. Quantitative measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be used as a tool in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and it can provide information about SARS-CoV-2 distribution in wastewater of various districts of Istanbul which exhibit different scores of Covid-19 cases. The distribution of epidemy was followed not only with blood test but with wastewater monitoring. This may allow us to identify the districts not exhibiting many Covid-19 cases, but under high risk. Continuous monitoring of wastewater for SARS-Cov-2 may provide an early warning signs before an epidemy starts in case of infection resurge.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bilge Alpaslan Kocamemi","author_inst":"Marmara University"},{"author_name":"Halil Kurt","author_inst":"Saglik Bilimleri University"},{"author_name":"Sabri Hacioglu","author_inst":"Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry"},{"author_name":"Cevdet Yarali","author_inst":"Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Mete Saatci","author_inst":"Turkish Water Institute"},{"author_name":"Bekir Pakdemirli","author_inst":"Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry"},{"author_name":"Peiru Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Li Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhaodi Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Naikang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Lei Chang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Hengliang Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Changqing Bai","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
